Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

You also handle **refunds and compensation**.\n\nBefore taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, changing cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\n### User\nEach user has a profile containing:\n- user id\n- email\n- addresses\n- date of birth\n- payment methods\n- membership level\n- reservation numbers\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **credit card**, **gift card**, **travel certificate**.\n\nThere are three membership levels: **regular**, **silver**, **gold**.\n\n### Flight\nEach flight has the following attributes:\n- flight number\n- origin\n- destination\n- scheduled departure and arrival time (local time)\n\nA flight can be available at multiple dates. For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.",

The scenario says that the booking might be more than 24 hours ago, but she was out of town, so that's okay. She also mentioned that if the agent says cancellation isn't possible, she should mention that she didn't need insurance because she booked with the same agency before. But she doesn't want to cancel without a refund.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate her response to the agent's greeting. She should start by stating her intent to cancel the reservation. She might mention the reservation number and her name. Since she's Emma Kim, she'll use that name. She might also mention the user ID if asked, but maybe not immediately. The key points are the cancellation request and the reservation number. She should also hint at the insurance part if the agent tries to deny cancellation. But since the agent hasn't responded yet, she just needs to state her request clearly. Let me make sure I don't add any extra info not in the scenario. She's not mentioning the insurance yet because the agent hasn't said anything about cancellation being impossible. So the first message should be straightforward: asking to cancel reservation EHGLP3, maybe with her name and user ID if needed. Wait, the known info includes her user ID, but she might not mention it unless asked. Let me check the task instructions again. The task says to disclose info progressively. So she might just say her name first. The agent will probably ask for the reservation number, so she can provide that. Then, if the agent says cancellation isn't possible, she'll bring up the insurance part. But for now, just the initial request. So the response should be something like, \"Hi, I'd like to cancel my reservation EHGLP3. My name is Emma Kim.\" That's natural and follows the guidelines. No need to mention the user ID unless asked. Alright, that should be the first message.\n</think>\n\nHi, I'd like to cancel my reservation EHGLP3. My name is Emma Kim.",

First, I need to check if I have all the necessary information to proceed with the cancellation.\n\nAccording to the policy, to cancel a flight, I need the user's user ID and reservation ID. The user provided the reservation ID (EHGLP3), but I don't have their user ID yet. The policy states that the user must provide their user ID. So, I should ask them for that.\n\nAdditionally, the cancellation process requires the reason for cancellation. The user hasn't provided that yet. The possible reasons are change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons. I need to prompt them to specify the reason.\n\nAlso, I should check if any part of the flight has already been flown. If so, cancellation isn't possible, and I need to transfer to a human agent. But since I don't have the flight details yet, I can't check that. So, I'll need to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, request the user ID. Then, ask for the reason for cancellation. Once I have those, I can check the flight status and proceed with cancellation if allowed. If not, transfer to a human agent.\n\nWait, the policy also mentions that if the flight has already been flown, cancellation isn't possible. So maybe I should first check the flight status using the reservation ID to see if any flights are in progress. But how? The tools available include get_reservation_details, which might provide flight details. However, the user hasn't provided the reservation ID yet. Wait, the user did provide the reservation ID: EHGLP3. So maybe I should first get the reservation details to check the flight status.\n\nBut according to the policy, the agent must obtain the user ID and reservation ID. The user provided the reservation ID, but not the user ID. So first, I need to get the user ID. However, the user mentioned their name is Emma Kim. Maybe the user ID is related to their name, but the policy says the user must provide their user ID. So I can't assume. Therefore, I should ask the user for their user ID.\n\nWait, the user might not know their user ID. The policy says if the user doesn't know their reservation ID, the agent should help locate it. But in this case, the user provided the reservation ID. However, the user ID is still required. So I need to ask for the user ID. Let me check the tools. There's a get_user_details tool that requires the user ID. But without the user ID, I can't proceed. Therefore, the correct step is to ask the user for their user ID.\n\nSo, the next step is to prompt the user to provide their user ID. Once I have that, I can proceed to check the reservation details, flight status, and then process the cancellation based on the policy rules.\n</think>\n\nI need to cancel my reservation EHGLP3. My name is Emma Kim. Could you please confirm the user ID associated with this reservation? Also, could you let me know the reason for cancellation (e.g., change of plan, airline cancelled flight, other reasons)?",

Wait, the instructions say if the agent says cancellation isn't possible, mention the insurance part. But right now, the user is just providing the reason.

Wait, the known info says the user wants to cancel because they were out of town, but the task instructions mention that if cancellation isn't possible, they should mention the insurance. But in this step, the user hasn't been told cancellation isn't possible yet. So maybe the reason for cancellation is that they were out of town, but the user is concerned about getting a refund. Wait, the user's task instructions say they don't want to cancel if they don't get a refund. So maybe the reason is that they need a refund, but the agent is asking for the reason. The user might need to explain that they were out of town, but the main reason is to get a refund. Wait, the scenario says the reason for the call is to cancel EHGLP3, and the known info is that it's more than 24 hours after booking but they were out of town.

              "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to cancel their reservation EHGLP3. They provided their user ID as emma_kim_9957 and the reason is they were out of town for over 24 hours after booking.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the cancellation is allowed based on the policy. The policy says you can cancel if the booking was made within the last 24 hours, the flight is cancelled by the airline, it's a business flight, or if the user has travel insurance and the reason is covered. \n\nThe user's reason is being out of town for more than 24 hours after booking. Wait, the policy mentions that if the booking was made within the last 24 hours, but the user says they were out of town after booking. That might not fit the 24-hour rule. Also, they didn't mention the flight being cancelled or having travel insurance. \n\nBut the user might be implying that they booked recently and then couldn't use the flight. However, the exact reason given is that they were out of town for over 24 hours after booking. The policy's cancellation conditions don't include that as a valid reason. So, the agent needs to check if any of the allowed reasons apply. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided the reservation details yet, maybe I should first get the reservation details to check the booking time and other info. But according to the policy, the agent must confirm the reason for cancellation. The user's reason isn't one of the allowed ones unless they have travel insurance. \n\nWait, the user might have travel insurance. The policy says if they have insurance and the reason is covered (health or weather), then cancellation is allowed. But the user's reason is being out of town, which isn't covered. So, unless they have insurance, it's not allowed. \n\nBut the user hasn't mentioned insurance. So, the agent needs to check if the reservation has insurance. However, the user hasn't provided the reservation details yet. \n\nWait, the user provided the reservation ID, so maybe the agent should first get the reservation details to check the booking time and insurance status. But according to the policy, the agent must confirm the reason for cancellation. The user's reason is not one of the allowed ones unless they have insurance. \n\nBut the user might not have insurance. So, the agent needs to check if the booking was made within 24 hours. If the booking was made recently, then cancellation is allowed. However, the user says they were out of town after booking, which might mean the booking was made more than 24 hours ago. \n\nWait, the user's reason is that they were out of town for more than 24 hours after booking. That suggests the booking was made more than 24 hours ago, so the 24-hour rule doesn't apply. Therefore, the cancellation isn't allowed unless other conditions are met. \n\nBut the user might have travel insurance. The agent needs to check if the reservation has insurance. However, the user hasn't provided that info yet. \n\nSo, the agent should first confirm the reservation details to check the booking time and insurance status. But according to the policy, the agent must first obtain the user ID and reservation ID. The user provided both. \n\nWait, the user already provided the reservation ID and user ID. The next step is to check if the cancellation is allowed. The agent needs to verify the reason. Since the user's reason isn't one of the allowed ones, the agent should inform them that cancellation isn't possible unless they meet the criteria. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is eligible for a refund if they have insurance. But the user hasn't mentioned insurance. \n\nSo, the agent should first check the reservation details to see if the booking was made within 24 hours. If not, then check if the user has insurance. If not, then the cancellation isn't allowed. \n\nBut the user's reason is not covered by the policy. Therefore, the agent should inform the user that cancellation isn't possible unless they meet the criteria. However, the user might need to provide more information. \n\nAlternatively, the agent should proceed to cancel the reservation if the conditions are met. But based on the given info, the user's reason isn't valid. \n\nWait, the policy says that if the booking was made within the last 24 hours, cancellation is allowed. The user says they were out of town for more than 24 hours after booking. That implies the booking was made more than 24 hours ago. So, the 24-hour rule doesn't apply. \n\nTherefore, the agent needs to check if the user has travel insurance. If they do, and the reason is covered (health or weather), then cancellation is allowed.

But based on the given info, the user's reason isn't valid. \n\nWait, the user's reason is \"I was out of town for more than 24 hours after booking.\" That might mean the booking was made more than 24 hours ago, so the 24-hour rule doesn't apply. Therefore, the cancellation isn't allowed unless other conditions are met. \n\nSo, the agent should inform the user that cancellation isn't possible unless they meet the criteria. However, the user might need to provide more information. \n\nBut according to the policy, the agent must check the cancellation rules before proceeding. Since the user's reason isn't valid, the agent should inform them that cancellation isn't allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the agent should check the reservation details to confirm the booking time. If the booking was made within 24 hours, then cancellation is allowed. \n\nBut the user's reason is not about the booking time. They said they were out of town after booking, which might mean the booking was made more than 24 hours ago. \n\nTherefore, the agent should check the reservation details to confirm the booking time. If the booking was made within 24 hours, then cancellation is allowed. Otherwise, not. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the reservation details yet. So, the agent should first get the reservation details to check the booking time and other info. \n\nWait, the user provided the reservation ID, so the agent can call get_reservation_details with reservation_id EHGLP3 to get the booking time. \n\nBut according to the policy, the agent must first obtain the user ID and reservation ID. The user provided both. \n\nSo, the next step is to check the reservation details. The agent should call get_reservation_details with reservation_id EHGLP3. \n\nOnce the details are retrieved, the agent can check the booking time and see if it's within 24 hours. If yes, then cancellation is allowed. If not, check if the user has travel insurance and the reason is covered. \n\nBut the user's reason isn't covered. So, the agent needs to inform them that cancellation isn't possible unless they meet the criteria. \n\nAlternatively, the agent should proceed to cancel the reservation if the conditions are met. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the reservation details yet. So, the agent should first call get_reservation_details to get the necessary info. \n\nTherefore, the correct step is to call get_reservation_details with the reservation ID provided by the user.\n</think>",

The policy says that cancellation is allowed if the booking was made within the last 24 hours, the flight is cancelled by the airline, it's a business flight, or the user has travel insurance with a covered reason. \n\nLooking at the reservation details from the tool response: the reservation was created on 2024-05-04 at 23:12:06. The current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST. The user is cancelling on May 15th, which is 11 days after the booking. So the 24-hour window has passed. \n\nThe reason given is being out of town for over 24 hours after booking. The policy mentions that the reason must be covered by insurance if the user doesn't meet certain membership tiers. The user's membership level isn't provided here, but the reservation details show the cabin is basic economy. \n\nThe policy states that refunds are only given if the user is a silver/gold member, has travel insurance, or flew business. Since this is basic economy and there's no mention of insurance, the user might not qualify. However, the user's reason is a change of plan, which might not be covered. \n\nWait, the user's reason is \"out of town for more than 24 hours after booking.\" The policy's cancellation reasons include \"change of plan,\" which is allowed if the booking was within 24 hours. But since the booking was over 24 hours ago, that's not applicable. \n\nThe user's reservation details don't mention travel insurance (insurance is set to \"no\"). The user is a regular member (since the cabin is basic economy and the policy's compensation rules apply). \n\nSo, according to the policy, the cancellation can't be processed because the booking was more than 24 hours ago, there's no insurance, and it's basic economy. Therefore, the agent should transfer the user to a human agent. \n\nBut wait, the user's reason is \"out of town for more than 24 hours after booking.\" The policy's cancellation rules don't mention this as a valid reason. The valid reasons are change of plan (if within 24 hours), airline cancellation, business flight, or insurance-covered reasons. Since the user's reason isn't one of these, and the booking was over 24 hours ago, the cancellation isn't allowed. \n\nTherefore, the agent should transfer the user to a human agent because the request can't be handled with the available tools. The tool call to transfer_to_human_agents is needed, followed by the message.\n</think>",

But according to the scenario, the user is supposed to simulate the customer. So after the transfer message, the user would wait, but since the scenario is ending here, maybe the correct token is TRANSFER. Let me check the example. The user's last message was the transfer, so the assistant should respond with ###TRANSFER###. But the user might not have finished.
