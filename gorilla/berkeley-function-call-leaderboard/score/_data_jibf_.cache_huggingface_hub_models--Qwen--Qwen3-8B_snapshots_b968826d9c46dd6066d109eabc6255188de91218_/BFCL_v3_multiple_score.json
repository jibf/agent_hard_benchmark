The user is asking for the fastest route from London to Edinburgh for playing a chess championship and also wants an estimate of the distance. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's the route_planner.calculate_route function, which can determine the best route between two points with options for method (fastest, shortest, balanced). The parameters required are start and destination, with method being optional and defaulting to fastest. The user specifically mentioned the fastest route, so that's covered by the default parameter. However, the function's description doesn't mention providing distance estimates. Hmm, so maybe the route_planner function only gives the route details but not the distance. \n\nWait, the user also wants an estimate of the distance. But none of the provided functions seem to handle distance calculation. The chess_club_details.find function provides club details, including location, but not route information. So, the available functions might not fully address the user's request. \n\nBut the user is asking for the fastest route and distance. Since the route_planner function can calculate the route, maybe the distance is part of the route calculation. However, the function's parameters don't include a parameter for distance. The function's description says it determines the best route, but it's unclear if it returns distance. The user might assume that the fastest route would include distance, but without explicit parameters, I can't be sure. \n\nGiven the functions available, the best approach is to call route_planner.calculate_route with start as London and destination as Edinburgh, using the fastest method. Even though the distance isn't explicitly mentioned, maybe the function's output includes it. However, since the user also asked for an estimate, and there's no function for distance, I might need to inform them that the distance isn't available. But according to the instructions, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. Wait, the user's question requires both route and distance. Since the available functions don't include a distance function, I can only use the route planner. \n\nSo, the answer would be to call the route_planner function for the fastest route. But the user also wants distance. Since there's no function for distance, I can't provide that. However, the user might be expecting that the route calculation includes distance. But the function's parameters don't have a distance parameter, so maybe the function doesn't return it. Therefore, the correct step is to call the route_planner function with the given parameters and note that distance isn't available. But according to the problem statement, I should only return the function calls if possible. Since the user's question requires two things (route and distance), but the functions can only handle the route, I should call the route function and mention that distance isn't available. However, the user's instruction says if parameters are missing, point it out. Wait, the user's question is about the fastest route and distance. The route_planner function can provide the route, but not the distance. So, the answer would be to call the route_planner function for the fastest route, but the distance part can't be addressed with the given functions. Therefore, the correct function call is to use route_planner.calculate_route with start=London, destination=Edinburgh, method=fastest. The distance part can't be handled, so I should mention that, but according to the problem's instructions, I should only return the function calls. So, the answer is to call that function.\n</think>\n\n[route_planner.calculate_route(start=\"London\", destination=\"Edinburgh\", method=\"fastest\")]", "possible_answer": [{"route_planner.calculate_route": {"start": ["London"], "destination": ["Edinburgh"], "method": ["fastest", ""]}}]}

Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the video_games.store_price function. Its description says it fetches the selling price of a game on a specific platform and region. The parameters required are game_title, platform, and region (with a default of US). Since the user specified the US, I don't need to adjust the region. The function should return the price, which would be the cheapest if it's the current price. But wait, does the function check sales or just the regular price? The description says \"selling price,\" which might include sales. However, there's also the video_games.on_sale function to check if it's on sale. But the user wants the cheapest price, which could be the sale price if it's lower. However, the store_price function might already return the current price, which could be discounted. But maybe the user wants to ensure it's the lowest possible, so perhaps checking both? Wait, but the functions available don't include a way to get historical prices or compare different sales. The on_sale function just checks if it's currently on sale. So maybe the store_price function would give the current price, which might be the sale price. So I should call store_price with the game title, platform as PlayStation, and region as US. That should give the current selling price, which would be the cheapest available now.

Let me look at the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the game_rewards.get function. Its description says it retrieves reward information based on game, platform, mission, and trophy. The required parameters are game and platform, which the user provided: Fortnite and Playstation. The mission and trophy are optional, but the user mentioned different missions and trophies, so I should include those. However, since they are optional, maybe the function can handle them. Wait, the parameters for mission and trophy have defaults, but if the user wants different ones, perhaps we need to specify. But how? The function might allow passing those parameters. \n\nWait, the user is asking for rewards across different missions and trophies. So maybe I need to call the function with varying mission and trophy values. But since the function's parameters are optional, maybe the function can return all rewards for the game and platform, and then filter by mission and trophy. However, the user might want to know all possible rewards, so perhaps the function can be called without specifying mission or trophy to get all. But the user specifically mentioned different missions and trophies, so maybe the function can handle that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can be called with mission and trophy as empty strings to get all rewards. But the parameters have defaults as empty strings. Wait, the parameters for mission and trophy are optional, with default to empty string. So if we don't provide them, the function might return all rewards for the game and platform. But the user wants to know about different missions and trophies, so perhaps the function can return all possible rewards, including different missions and trophies. \n\nSo the correct function call would be game_rewards.get with game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation'. Since mission and trophy are optional and the user wants different ones, maybe we don't need to specify them. But the function's parameters allow for mission and trophy to be provided. However, the user is asking for rewards for different missions and trophies, so perhaps the function can return all rewards, and the user can see the different missions and trophies. \n\nTherefore, the function call should be game_rewards.get(game='Fortnite', platform='Playstation'). That should retrieve all rewards for Fortnite on Playstation, which would include different missions and trophies. \n\nI don't need to call other functions. The game_missions.list might list missions, but the user is asking about rewards, so game_rewards.get is the right choice. The game_scores.get is for scores and rankings, which isn't needed here. \n\nSo the final function call is game_rewards.get with game and platform parameters.\n</think>\n\n[game_rewards.get(game=\"Fortnite\", platform=\"Playstation\")]", "possible_answer": [{"game_rewards.get": {"game": ["Fortnite"], "platform": ["Playstation", "PS"], "mission": [""], "trophy": [""]}}]}

The user wants to find the final velocity of an object thrown up at 40 m/s after 6 seconds. Hmm. So, the functions available are kinematics.final_velocity, kinematics.distance, and physics.wave_velocity. The wave velocity function isn't relevant here because it's about waves, not motion under acceleration. So, I should use the kinematics.final_velocity function.\n\nLooking at the parameters for final_velocity: initial_velocity, time, and acceleration. The required ones are initial_velocity and time. The acceleration has a default value of -9.81, which is Earth's gravity. Since the object is thrown upward, gravity is acting against the motion, so acceleration should be -9.81 m/s\u00b2. \n\nThe initial_velocity is given as 40 m/s. Time is 6 seconds. The function requires initial_velocity and time, which are both provided. The acceleration isn't specified in the question, so the default will be used. So the call should be final_velocity with initial_velocity=40, time=6, and acceleration=-9.81. Wait, but the parameters for the function say acceleration is a float, and the default is -9.81. But the user didn't mention acceleration, so maybe we should include it explicitly? Or just rely on the default. The required parameters are initial_velocity and time, so acceleration is optional. But since the object is thrown upward, the acceleration due to gravity is -9.81. So including it would be better to make it clear. Let me check the function's parameters again. The acceleration is a float, and the default is -9.81. So even if we don't include it, it will use that value. But maybe the user expects that. So the function call would be kinematics.final_velocity(initial_velocity=40, time=6). Wait, but the parameters for the function have initial_velocity as an integer, but the user provided 40 m/s. Wait, looking at the parameters: initial_velocity is an integer? Wait, in the kinematics.final_velocity parameters, initial_velocity is of type integer? Wait, no. Let me check again. The parameters for kinematics.final_velocity: initial_velocity is type integer? Wait, the parameters for kinematics.final_velocity are: initial_velocity is type integer, time is integer, acceleration is float. But the user's initial_velocity is 40 m/s. Wait, 40 is an integer. So that's okay. Time is 6 seconds, which is also an integer. So the function call would be final_velocity(initial_velocity=40, time=6). The acceleration is optional, and defaults to -9.81.

The user wants to calculate the magnetic field strength given a distance of 8 meters and a current of 12 Amperes. Hmm, which function should I use here? There are two options: Ampere's Law and Biot-Savart Law.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for each. Ampere's Law needs enclosed_current, radius, and optionally mu0. The Biot-Savart Law requires current, distance, and optionally mu0. The user provided distance and current. The current in the question is 12 A, which matches the Biot-Savart's current parameter. The distance is 8 meters, which fits Biot-Savart's distance parameter. \n\nWait, but Ampere's Law uses radius, which is similar to distance here. But the question mentions distance, not radius. However, maybe in some contexts, radius and distance can be used interchangeably. But the problem is that Ampere's Law typically applies to situations with cylindrical symmetry, like a long straight conductor, where the magnetic field is calculated using the enclosed current and the radius of the Amperian loop. \n\nBut the Biot-Savart Law is more general and can be used for a straight conductor as well. The parameters for Biot-Savart here are current and distance. The user provided both, so that seems to fit. However, the Biot-Savart function's parameters are described as current (integer) and distance (integer). The user's current is 12 A, which is an integer, and distance is 8 meters, also an integer. So that works. \n\nWait, but the Biot-Savart Law usually involves the length of the conductor and the angle, but maybe in this case, the function is simplified. The description says \"distance from the current carrying conductor,\" so maybe it's assuming a straight conductor and calculating the field at a point at distance r. In that case, the formula would be B = (mu0 * I) / (2\u03c0r). But the function's parameters are current and distance, so that's probably the case. \n\nSo the correct function here is Biot-Savart Law with current=12 and distance=8. The mu0 is optional and defaults to 0.000001256. So the function call should be electromagnetism.biot_savart_law with current=12 and distance=8. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"strength of magnetic field\" which could be either. But given the parameters, Biot-Savart is the right choice here. Ampere's Law would require enclosed current and radius. The user provided current and distance, so Biot-Savart is the way to go.\n</think>\n\n[electromagnetism.biot_savart_law(current=12, distance=8)]", "possible_answer": [{"electromagnetism.biot_savart_law": {"current": [12], "distance": [8], "mu0": [1.256e-06, 1.256e-06, ""]}}]}

There are two compound-related functions: calc_Compound_Interest and future_value. Let me look at their parameters.\n\nThe calc_Compound_Interest function requires principle_amount, duration, annual_rate, and compound_freq (which has a default of 1). The future_value function needs initial_investment, interest_rate (as a decimal), time, and num_compoundings (default 1). \n\nThe user provided principle_amount=1500, duration=2 years, annual_rate=2.5%. Wait, the annual_rate in the functions: for calc_Compound_Interest, it's a percentage, so 2.5% would be 2.5. But in future_value, interest_rate is a decimal, so 2.5% would be 0.025. The question says \"annual interest rate of 2.5%\", so I need to check which function's parameters match. \n\nThe user's question mentions \"compound interest,\" so maybe calc_Compound_Interest is the right one. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters for calc_Compound_Interest are principle_amount, duration, annual_rate. The annual_rate is in percentage, so 2.5% would be 2.5. The compound_freq is optional, defaulting to 1. So if the user didn't specify compounding frequency, we can use the default. \n\nAlternatively, the future_value function might also work if we convert the rate correctly. But the user specifically mentioned compound interest, so maybe the first function is more appropriate. Let me confirm. The calc_Compound_Interest function's description says it computes compound interest, so that's the one to use. \n\nSo the parameters would be principle_amount=1500, duration=2, annual_rate=2.5. The compound_freq is optional, so we can omit it or set it to 1. Since the user didn't specify, we can use the default. Therefore, the function call should be calc_Compound_Interest with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n[calc_Compound_Interest(principle_amount=1500, duration=2, annual_rate=2.5)]", "possible_answer": [{"calc_Compound_Interest": {"principle_amount": [1500], "duration": [2], "annual_rate": [2.5], "compound_freq": ["", 1]}}]}

Let me check the functions provided.\n\nLooking at the sculpture.create_custom function, the material parameter has an enum with options: Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, Stone. So the available materials are those five. The user specified bronze, which is one of the options. \n\nWait, the question is about material options available. The function's parameters list the enum values, so the answer should list those. But the user might be confirming if bronze is an option. Since bronze is in the enum, it's available. The function doesn't have a parameter to ask for available materials, so maybe the answer is derived from the function's definition. \n\nBut the user's question is about material options, so the response should list the materials from the enum. However, the user is asking for the options, not to create a sculpture yet. But the functions provided don't include one that retrieves available materials. The sculpture.create_custom function's material parameter's enum lists the options. So the answer is that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. Since the user mentioned bronze, which is available, they can proceed. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided all parameters yet. They want to know the options. However, the functions don't have a way to query materials. So the assistant should list the materials from the function's enum. But according to the instructions, if the question lacks parameters required by the function, point it out. However, the user is asking for available materials, not to create a sculpture. So maybe no function call is needed. Wait, but the user is asking about material options, which are defined in the function's parameters. Since the functions don't have a function to list materials, the assistant should answer based on the function's enum. But the user's question is not a request to create a sculpture but to know the options. However, the available functions don't include a way to retrieve that info. Therefore, the assistant should answer based on the function's parameters. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only return function calls if applicable. Since there's no function to get material options, the assistant can't call a function. But the user's question is about material options, which are part of the sculpture.create_custom function's parameters. However, the user hasn't provided all required parameters (item and material). Wait, the user is asking about material options, not to create the sculpture yet. So the assistant should explain the options, but since the functions don't have a function to retrieve that info, the assistant can't make a function call. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the available materials are listed in the function's enum. But according to the instructions, if none of the functions can be used, point it out. However, the user's question is about material options, which are part of the sculpture.create_custom function's parameters. But the assistant can't call a function to get that info. Therefore, the answer is that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. But the user hasn't provided the required parameters for creating the sculpture.

Therefore, the answer is that the available materials are the ones listed in the enum. But the user's question is not a function call. However, the user might be trying to create the sculpture, so the assistant should check if the parameters are provided. The user mentioned bronze, which is an option. But the question is about the options. So the assistant should answer that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. But according to the instructions, the assistant should only return function calls. Since the user hasn't provided all required parameters (item and material), but the question is about materials, maybe the assistant should call the sculpture.create_custom function with the item as 'horse' and material as 'Bronze' to check if it's available. Wait, but the function's parameters require item and material. The user hasn't provided the material yet, but they are asking about options. So the assistant can't call the function without the required parameters. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the available materials are the ones listed in the enum. But the assistant can't make a function call for that. So the answer is that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. However, the user's question is not a function call, so the assistant should answer directly. But the problem says to only return function calls. Therefore, the assistant can't make a function call here and should point out that the materials are available as per the function's enum.

Wait, the functions provided are for vegan products, but the user is asking for vegetarian and gluten-free. Hmm. The functions available for Walmart, Safeway, and Whole Foods all have the vegan_products method, which takes categories as vegan or gluten-free. But the user is asking for vegetarian, which isn't one of the categories in the enum. Oh, wait, the categories parameter in the functions only allows 'vegan' or 'gluten-free'. So the user's request for vegetarian isn't directly supported by the available functions. But maybe the user meant vegan? Or perhaps they want both vegan and gluten-free? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe user says \"vegetarian and gluten-free\". But the functions don't have a vegetarian category. So maybe the user is confused, or maybe they want to combine categories. However, the function's categories enum only includes 'vegan' and 'gluten-free'. So if I call the walmart.vegan_products function with categories as ['vegan', 'gluten-free'], that might get both. But the function's categories are an array of those two options. Wait, the description says \"Product categories to search within. Default empty array\". So maybe the function can take multiple categories. But the user is asking for vegetarian, which isn't an option. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and they meant vegan. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle vegetarian as a category, but according to the enum, it's not allowed. \n\nSo the correct approach would be to call the walmart.vegan_products function with location 'Denver, CO' and categories as ['gluten-free'] to get gluten-free items, but the user also wants vegetarian. Since vegetarian isn't an option, maybe the function can't fulfill that part. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for vegan and gluten-free, which are the available categories. So perhaps the user made a typo. \n\nIn that case, the best possible action is to call the walmart.vegan_products function with location 'Denver, CO' and categories as ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] to get both categories. But since the user specifically mentioned vegetarian, which isn't available, the function can't handle that. However, the user might have meant vegan. So the answer would be to call the walmart.vegan_products function with the given location and categories as ['vegan', 'gluten-free'] to cover both vegan and gluten-free products, even though the user said vegetarian. Alternatively, if the user insists on vegetarian, the function can't do that.

The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Since they want the AA genotype, that's the homozygous dominant, which should be p squared.\n\nWait, the user provided the allele frequency of A as 0.3. So p is 0.3. Then AA frequency would be (0.3)^2. But let me check the functions available. There's a function called calculate_genotype_frequency. Let me look at its parameters. It requires allele_frequency and genotype. The genotype parameter has an enum with AA, Aa, aa. The default is homozygous dominant, which is AA. So if the user is asking for AA, I can use this function by setting genotype to 'AA' and allele_frequency to 0.3. \n\nAlternatively, since the function is based on Hardy-Weinberg, maybe it's already handling the calculation.

They provided the net income as $2,000,000, shareholder's equity as $10,000,000, and dividends paid of $200,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for return on equity. From what I remember, ROE is calculated by dividing net income by shareholder's equity. But wait, sometimes dividends are considered too. Wait, the function parameters include dividends_paid as an optional parameter. Let me check the function description again.\n\nThe function calculate_return_on_equity has parameters: net_income, shareholder_equity, and dividends_paid (optional, defaults to 0). The description says it calculates ROE based on net income, shareholder's equity, and dividends paid. Hmm, but the standard ROE formula is net income divided by shareholder's equity. Dividends might be part of the calculation if they're adjusting equity, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe the function uses the formula (net income - dividends) divided by shareholder's equity? Or perhaps it's just net income divided by average shareholder's equity? But the parameters here include dividends_paid. Let me check the function's parameters again.\n\nThe parameters required are net_income and shareholder_equity. Dividends_paid is optional. So maybe the function uses net income minus dividends paid divided by shareholder's equity? Or maybe it's just net income divided by shareholder's equity, and dividends are not part of the calculation. Wait, the function's description says \"based on its net income, shareholder's equity, and dividends paid.\" So perhaps the formula is (net income - dividends) / shareholder's equity? Or maybe it's net income divided by (shareholder's equity - dividends)? I'm not entirely sure, but the user provided all three values, so I should include them as per the function's parameters.\n\nWait, the function's parameters are net_income, shareholder_equity, and dividends_paid (optional). The required parameters are net_income and shareholder_equity. So the user provided all three, so I should include them. So the function call would be calculate_return_on_equity with net_income=2000000, shareholder_equity=10000000, dividends_paid=200000. That's all the parameters given.

The user wants a vegan recipe for brownies that can be prepared in under 30 minutes. I need to use the find_recipe function here. Let me check the parameters required for that function. The function needs dietary_restrictions, recipe_type, and time. \n\nThe user specified vegan, so dietary_restrictions is set to 'vegan'. The recipe_type is 'brownies', but wait, the function's example lists recipe types like dessert, main course, etc. Brownies are typically considered a dessert. So I should set recipe_type to 'dessert' to match the function's expected input. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept 'brownies' as a recipe type. Hmm, the description says 'type of the recipe' and gives examples like dessert, main course, breakfast. So maybe 'brownies' isn't a valid value here. The user might have meant the recipe type as dessert. But the user wrote 'brownies' as the recipe type. Wait, maybe the function allows specific recipe names. Let me check the parameters again. The recipe_type parameter's description says 'Type of the recipe. E.g. dessert, main course, breakfast.' So examples are categories, not specific dishes. So brownies would fall under dessert. Therefore, I should set recipe_type to 'dessert'. \n\nBut the user specifically said 'brownies', so maybe the function can take that. Wait, the function's parameters don't specify that it's only for categories. Maybe the user intended to specify the recipe type as 'brownies' as a specific type. But according to the examples given in the description, it's more about categories. However, the function's parameters might accept specific recipe names. Let me think. If I put 'brownies' as the recipe_type, would that work? The function's documentation isn't clear. But since the user asked for brownies, perhaps the function can handle that. Alternatively, maybe the recipe_type should be 'dessert' and the function will search for dessert recipes, including brownies. \n\nBut the user's query is for a brownie recipe, so maybe the recipe_type should be 'brownies' even if it's not in the examples. The function might be designed to accept specific recipe names. Let me proceed with 'brownies' as the recipe_type. \n\nTime is under 30 minutes, so time=30. Wait, the parameter is time, which is an integer. The user said 'under 30 minutes', so maybe 25 or 30. But the function's parameter is time, which is the time limit. So if the user says under 30, perhaps setting time=30 would include recipes that take up to 30 minutes. But the user wants under 30, so maybe time=25. However, the function might have its own logic. Since the user specified 'under 30', the safest is to set time=30, as the function might accept that. \n\nSo putting it all together: dietary_restrictions='vegan', recipe_type='brownies', time=30. \n\nWait, but if the function's recipe_type expects categories, then 'brownies' might not be valid. In that case, the user's request might not be fulfillable. But the function's parameters don't list allowed values, so we have to assume that the user can input specific recipe names. \n\nTherefore, the function call would be find_recipe with dietary_restrictions='vegan', recipe_type='brownies', time=30. \n\nAlternatively, if the recipe_type must be a category, then the user's request might not be possible.

The user wants to book a luxury room at Hotel Paradise in Las Vegas with a city view for 3 days starting May 12, 2022. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The book_hotel function seems appropriate here. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are hotel_name, location, room_type, start_date, and stay_duration. The user provided all these: hotel name is Hotel Paradise, location is Las Vegas, room type is luxury, start date is May 12, 2022, and stay duration is 3 days. \n\nThere's also an optional parameter for view, which the user specified as city view. So I should include that. The default for view is 'No preference', but since the user wants a city view, I need to set that parameter. \n\nPutting it all together, the function call should have all the required parameters plus the view. Let me double-check the parameters' data types. Hotel name and location are strings, room_type is a string, start_date is in MM-DD-YYYY format, which the user provided as May 12, 2022. Wait, the format should be MM-DD-YYYY, so May is 05, so the date should be 05-12-2022. The user wrote May 12, 2022, but maybe the function expects the numeric format. However, the user input might be acceptable if the function can parse it. But to be safe, maybe convert it to 05-12-2022. Wait, the user's input is \"starting from May 12, 2022\" so the start_date parameter should be in MM-DD-YYYY format. So May is 05, so the date should be 05-12-2022. But the user wrote it as May 12, 2022. Does the function accept the month name or does it need the numeric value? The description says the format is MM-DD-YYYY, so the user's input might need to be converted. However, the user might have provided the date in the correct format. Wait, the user wrote \"May 12, 2022\" but the required format is MM-DD-YYYY. So the correct format would be 05-12-2022. But the user's input is in a different format. However, maybe the function can handle it if the user inputs it as \"May 12, 2022\" or maybe it's a typo. Hmm, but the parameters specify the format as MM-DD-YYYY, so the start_date should be in that format. Therefore, I should adjust the date to 05-12-2022. But the user's instruction says to use the parameters as given. Wait, the user's instruction says to make the function call based on the question. The user wrote \"starting from May 12, 2022\", so the start_date parameter should be \"05-12-2022\" to match the required format. However, the user might have intended to write the date in the correct format. But since the user wrote \"May 12, 2022\", perhaps the function expects the MM-DD-YYYY format, so I need to convert it. But the user's input might not have that. Wait, the user's input is the actual date, so maybe the function can accept it in the format they provided. Wait, the parameters for start_date specify the format as MM-DD-YYYY. So the user's input \"May 12, 2022\" is not in that format. Therefore, I need to convert it to 05-12-2022. But the user might not have provided that. However, the user's instruction is to use the given parameters. Wait, the user's question says \"starting from May 12, 2022\", so the start_date should be \"05-12-2022\". Therefore, I should format it accordingly. \n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nhotel_name: \"Hotel Paradise\"\n\nlocation: \"Las Vegas\"\n\nroom_type: \"luxury\"\n\nstart_date: \"05-12-2022\"\n\nstay_duration: 3\n\nview: \"city\"\n\nAll required parameters are present.
