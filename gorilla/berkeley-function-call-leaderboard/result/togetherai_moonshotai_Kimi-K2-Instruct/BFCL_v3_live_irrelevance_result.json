The key is to find the sequence of prime numbers starting from 1, where each subsequent prime is the smallest prime greater than the previous one. The process continues until we can't find a valid next person within the 64 people.\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n1. Start with person 1\n2. Find the next prime after 1 (which is 2)\n3. Find the next prime after 2 (which is 3, but the pattern shows 5 - let me reconsider)\n\nLooking at the given pattern:\n- 1 \u2192 2 (next prime after 1)\n- 2 \u2192 5 (but 3 is the next prime after 2)\n- 5 \u2192 11 (but 7 is the next prime after 5)\n\nWait, let me re-read the pattern more carefully. The pattern shows:\n- 1 \u2192 2\n- 2 \u2192 5  \n- 5 \u2192 11\n- 11 \u2192 23\n\nThis appears to be doubling and adding 1, or some other pattern, not necessarily the next prime. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the sequence: 1, 2, 5, 11, 23...\n- 1 to 2: +1\n- 2 to 5: +3  \n- 5 to 11: +6\n- 11 to 23: +12\n\nThe increments are: 1, 3, 6, 12... which are 1\u00d71, 1\u00d73, 2\u00d73, 4\u00d73... this seems to be 3\u00d72^(n-2) for n\u22652.\n\nBut the problem states \"the closest prime number greater than the previous position.\" Let me check if these are indeed primes:\n\n2, 5, 11, 23 are all primes, and they are the closest primes greater than the previous positions. Let me verify:\n- After 1: closest prime > 1 is 2 \u2713\n- After 2: closest prime > 2 is 3, but the pattern shows 5... \n\nLet me reconsider the problem statement. It says \"the closest prime number greater than the previous position\" but then gives examples that don't follow this rule strictly. However, the examples given are:\n- 23 \u2192 29 (29 is indeed the next prime after 23) \u2713\n- 43 \u2192 47 (47 is indeed the next prime after 43) \u2713\n\nSo the pattern should be: starting from the current position, find the next prime number greater than that position.\n\nLet me trace this properly:\n- Start: position 1\n- Next after 1: 2 (prime)\n- Next after 2: 3 (prime)\n- Next after 3: 5 (prime)\n- Next after 5: 7 (prime)\n- Next after 7: 11 (prime)\n- Next after 11: 13 (prime)\n- Next after 13: 17 (prime)\n- Next after 17: 19 (prime)\n- Next after 19: 23 (prime)\n- Next after 23: 29 (prime)\n- Next after 29: 31 (prime)\n- Next after 31: 37 (prime)\n- Next after 37: 41 (prime)\n- Next after 41: 43 (prime)\n- Next after 43: 47 (prime)\n- Next after 47: 53 (prime)\n- Next after 53: 59 (prime)\n- Next after 59: 61 (prime)\n- Next after 61: 67 (but 67 > 64, so we stop)\n\nThe last valid position within 64 people is 61.\n\nTherefore, the winner is the person with the number 61 on their shirt.", "input_token_count": 1150, "output_token_count": 808, "latency": 36.14982557296753}
