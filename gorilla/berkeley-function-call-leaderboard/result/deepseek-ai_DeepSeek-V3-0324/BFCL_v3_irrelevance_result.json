Here's an overview of how lions mate:\n\n### 1. **Estrus (Heat) Cycle**\n   - Female lions (lionesses) come into estrus (heat) multiple times a year, typically every 2-3 weeks if they are not pregnant.\n   - The estrus period lasts for about 4-7 days, during which the lioness is receptive to mating.\n\n### 2. **Courtship**\n   - When a lioness is in heat, she will signal her readiness to mate through vocalizations, scent marking, and physical displays.\n   - She may rub against the male lion (or males) and assume a mating posture (lordosis), where she lowers her front half and raises her hindquarters.\n   - The male lion will often follow the lioness closely, sniffing her to confirm her reproductive status.\n\n### 3. **Copulation**\n   - Mating occurs frequently during the estrus period, with pairs mating every 15-30 minutes for several days (up to 50 times in a 24-hour period).\n   - Each copulation lasts only about 10-30 seconds.\n   - The male lion bites the lioness's neck during mating, which is a common behavior in big cats to ensure cooperation.\n\n### 4. **Competition Among Males**\n   - If a pride has multiple males (coalition), they may compete for mating rights with the lioness.\n   - Dominant males usually have priority, but subordinate males may also mate if the dominant male is distracted or absent.\n\n### 5. **Post-Mating Behavior**\n   - After mating, the lioness may become aggressive toward the male, swatting or growling at him.\n   - The male may stay close to the lioness to guard her from other males, ensuring his paternity.\n\n### 6. **Gestation and Birth**\n   - If fertilization is successful, the lioness's gestation period lasts about 110 days (3.5 months).\n   - She will give birth to a litter of 1-6 cubs, usually in a secluded den away from the pride.\n\n### 7. **Parental Care**\n   - The lioness raises the cubs on her own initially, though other females in the pride may help.\n   - Male lions do not participate in rearing the cubs but may protect them from threats like rival males.\n\n### Interesting Facts:\n- Lionesses in a pride often synchronize their estrus cycles, leading to multiple females mating around the same time.\n- Infanticide can occur if a new male takes over the pride, as he may kill the cubs to bring the lionesses back into heat.\n\nThis process ensures the survival and genetic diversity of the pride.

{"id": "irrelevance_42", "result": "The evolutionary history of pandas, particularly the giant panda (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*), is a fascinating subject that traces back millions of years. Here's an overview of their evolutionary journey:\n\n### 1. **Early Ancestors**\n- Pandas belong to the family **Ursidae** (bears), but their lineage diverged from other bears around **20 million years ago** during the Miocene epoch.\n- Fossil evidence suggests that the earliest ancestors of pandas were small, omnivorous mammals that lived in what is now Europe and Asia.\n\n### 2. **Emergence of the Panda Lineage**\n- The genus *Ailurarctos*, which lived about **8 million years ago**, is considered one of the earliest direct ancestors of modern pandas. These animals were smaller than today's giant pandas and had a more generalized diet.\n- By the late Miocene and early Pliocene (around **5-7 million years ago**), the panda lineage began to specialize in bamboo consumption, as evidenced by fossilized teeth adapted for grinding tough plant material.\n\n### 3. **Giant Panda's Unique Adaptations**\n- The giant panda's distinctive **thumb-like structure** (a modified wrist bone called the radial sesamoid) evolved to help grasp bamboo stalks. This adaptation likely arose **2-3 million years ago**.\n- Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas evolved to rely almost entirely on bamboo due to its abundance in their habitat. Their digestive system, however, remains more similar to that of carnivores, making bamboo digestion inefficient.\n\n### 4. **Historical Range and Decline**\n- Fossil records indicate that pandas once had a much wider distribution across China, Myanmar, and even parts of Vietnam.\n- Climate changes and human expansion over the last few thousand years have drastically reduced their range to the mountainous regions of central China (Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces).\n\n### 5. **Red Panda Connection**\n- The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is not closely related to the giant panda but shares some traits due to **convergent evolution** (e.g., bamboo diet and false thumb). Red pandas belong to their own family, **Ailuridae**, and diverged from other carnivores much earlier.\n\n### 6. **Modern Conservation**\n- Today, giant pandas are a conservation icon and have been the focus of extensive efforts to protect their remaining habitats. Their evolutionary specialization to bamboo makes them highly vulnerable to habitat loss.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- Pandas evolved from bear-like ancestors but specialized in bamboo consumption millions of years ago.\n- Their unique adaptations, like the \"false thumb,\" are evolutionary responses to their bamboo diet.\n- Climate and human activity have significantly reduced their historical range.\n\nWould you like more details on any specific aspect of their evolution?", "input_token_count": 268, "output_token_count": 580, "latency": 41.442957639694214}
{"id": "irrelevance_43", "result": "Applying Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in game Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful way to create adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent behaviors for non-player characters (NPCs), optimize game mechanics, or even generate content. Here\u2019s how you can use EAs in game AI:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding Evolutionary Algorithms**\nEvolutionary Algorithms are inspired by biological evolution and involve:\n- **Population**: A set of candidate solutions (e.g., AI behaviors, strategies, or parameters).\n- **Fitness Function**: Measures how well a solution performs (e.g., how effective an NPC is in combat).\n- **Selection**: Choosing the best-performing solutions to \"reproduce.\"\n- **Crossover (Recombination)**: Combining traits of selected solutions to create new ones.\n- **Mutation**: Randomly altering traits to introduce diversity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Applications in Game AI**\n#### **a. NPC Behavior Optimization**\n- **Example**: Training NPCs to improve their combat strategies.\n  - **Population**: Different combat strategies (e.g., aggressive, defensive, balanced).\n  - **Fitness**: How often the NPC wins against the player or other NPCs.\n  - **Evolution**: Over generations, the best strategies are retained and improved.\n\n#### **b. Procedural Content Generation**\n- **Example**: Generating levels, maps, or puzzles.\n  - **Population**: Different level designs.\n  - **Fitness**: How fun, challenging, or balanced the level is (evaluated by playtesting or heuristics).\n  - **Evolution**: The best levels are combined and mutated to create new ones.\n\n#### **c. Adaptive Difficulty**\n- **Example**: Adjusting game difficulty based on player skill.\n  - **Population**: Different difficulty settings (e.g., enemy health, speed).\n  - **Fitness**: Player engagement or success rate.\n  - **Evolution**: The game adapts by evolving difficulty settings to match the player.\n\n#### **d. Pathfinding Optimization**\n- **Example**: Finding the most efficient paths for NPCs.\n  - **Population**: Different pathfinding algorithms or parameters.\n  - **Fitness**: Time taken to reach the destination or energy consumed.\n  - **Evolution**: The best paths are retained and refined.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Steps to Implement EA in Game AI**\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - What aspect of the game AI do you want to improve (e.g., NPC behavior, content generation)?\n\n2. **Encode Solutions**:\n   - Represent solutions as \"genes\" (e.g., parameters for NPC behavior, level layouts).\n\n3. **Design the Fitness Function**:\n   - Quantify how good a solution is (e.g., win rate, player satisfaction, efficiency).\n\n4. **Initialize the Population**:\n   - Create a diverse set of initial solutions.\n\n5. **Run the Evolutionary Loop**:\n   - Evaluate fitness, select the best, perform crossover and mutation, and repeat for multiple generations.\n\n6. **Integrate into the Game**:\n   - Use the evolved solutions in the game (e.g., deploy the best NPC strategies).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tools and Libraries**\n- **Python**: Libraries like `DEAP` or `PyGAD` for implementing EAs.\n- **Unity or Unreal Engine**: Use C# or C++ to implement custom EA logic.\n- **Frameworks**: Some game engines have plugins or built-in support for evolutionary computation.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Example: Evolving NPC Combat Strategies**\nHere\u2019s a high-level example:\n1. **Genes**: Parameters like \"aggression level,\" \"dodge probability,\" \"attack frequency.\"\n2. **Fitness**: NPC's survival time or damage dealt to the player.\n3. **Evolution**:\n   - Run battles between NPCs and players.\n   - Select top-performing NPCs.\n   - Combine their traits and introduce small random changes.\n   - Repeat for multiple generations.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Challenges**\n- **Computational Cost**: EAs can be slow for real-time games; consider offline training.\n- **Fitness Design**: Poor fitness functions can lead to unintended behaviors (e.g., NPCs exploiting game mechanics).\n- **Balance**: Ensure evolved solutions don\u2019t make the game too easy or hard.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Advanced Techniques**\n- **Co-Evolution**: Evolve two populations (e.g., NPCs and player strategies) to create dynamic challenges.\n- **Neuroevolution**: Combine EAs with neural networks for more complex behaviors.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help implementing a specific part of this, such as designing a fitness function or setting up an evolutionary loop?

{"id": "irrelevance_90", "result": "Civil law is a legal system derived from Roman law and is the foundation of the legal systems in many countries, including most of Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia and Africa. It is distinct from common law systems, which are based on judicial precedents. The components of civil law can be broadly categorized as follows:\n\n### 1. **Codified Legal Framework**\n   - Civil law systems are characterized by comprehensive legal codes that systematically organize laws into written statutes. These codes cover various areas of law, such as civil, criminal, commercial, and procedural law.\n   - Examples include the **Civil Code**, **Criminal Code**, and **Commercial Code**.\n\n### 2. **Private Law (Civil Law Proper)**\n   - This is the core of civil law and governs relationships between individuals or entities. It includes:\n     - **Contract Law**: Regulates agreements between parties.\n     - **Tort Law**: Deals with civil wrongs and compensation for harm caused.\n     - **Property Law**: Governs ownership and use of property.\n     - **Family Law**: Covers marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance.\n     - **Succession Law**: Deals with wills and inheritance.\n\n### 3. **Public Law**\n   - While civil law primarily focuses on private disputes, it also interacts with public law, which includes:\n     - **Constitutional Law**: Defines the structure of government and fundamental rights.\n     - **Administrative Law**: Governs the actions of government agencies.\n     - **Criminal Law**: Defines crimes and their punishments (though criminal law is often treated separately).\n\n### 4. **Procedural Law**\n   - This outlines the rules and processes for enforcing substantive rights and resolving disputes. It includes:\n     - **Civil Procedure**: Rules for filing lawsuits, evidence, and court proceedings.\n     - **Criminal Procedure**: Rules for prosecuting crimes.\n     - **Administrative Procedure**: Rules for administrative hearings.\n\n### 5. **Commercial Law**\n   - Governs business and commercial transactions, including:\n     - **Corporate Law**: Rules for forming and operating companies.\n     - **Bankruptcy Law**: Deals with insolvency and debt restructuring.\n     - **Consumer Protection Law**: Protects consumers from unfair practices.\n\n### 6. **International Private Law (Conflict of Laws)**\n   - Addresses legal disputes involving foreign elements, such as cross-border contracts or marriages.\n\n### 7. **Legal Principles**\n   - Civil law is based on general principles, such as:\n     - **Good Faith**: Parties must act honestly in contractual relationships.\n     - **Equity**: Fairness in applying the law.\n     - **Legal Certainty**: Laws must be clear and predictable.\n\n### 8. **Judicial Interpretation**\n   - While civil law relies on statutes, judges interpret and apply the law to specific cases. However, judicial decisions are not binding precedents (unlike in common law systems).\n\n### 9. **Legal Institutions**\n   - Includes courts, tribunals, and other bodies responsible for adjudicating disputes and enforcing laws.\n\n### 10. **Legal Education and Profession**\n   - Civil law systems emphasize formal legal education and training for judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals.\n\n### Key Features of Civil Law:\n- **Written Codes**: Laws are codified and accessible.\n- **Inquisitorial System**: Judges play an active role in investigating and deciding cases (unlike the adversarial system in common law).\n- **Less Reliance on Precedent**: Judicial decisions are not binding for future cases, though they may be persuasive.\n\nCivil law systems aim to provide clarity, consistency, and predictability in legal matters, making them distinct from other legal traditions like common law or religious law systems.", "input_token_count": 224, "output_token_count": 759, "latency": 49.23771786689758}

In other words, the happiness boost from income plateaus.\n   - **Relative Income**: People often compare their income to others in their social circle or society. Even if their income rises, if others' incomes rise faster, their happiness may not increase.\n\n### 3. **Demographic Differences**\n   - **Low-Income Groups**: For people in poverty or low-income brackets, even small increases in income can lead to significant improvements in happiness.\n   - **High-Income Groups**: For wealthy individuals, further income increases may not translate to proportional happiness gains, as non-material factors (relationships, purpose, health) become more important.\n\n### 4. **Non-Material Factors**\n   - **Social Connections**: Strong relationships and community ties often contribute more to happiness than income alone.\n   - **Health**: Physical and mental health are critical to happiness and are not solely dependent on income.\n   - **Purpose and Autonomy**: Feeling a sense of purpose and control over one's life can outweigh the effects of income.\n\n### 5. **Global Variations**\n   - In wealthier countries, the link between income and happiness is weaker compared to poorer countries, where income can be a more direct determinant of well-being.\n\n### Data Insight\nIf you'd like, I can fetch specific happiness index data for different income groups (low, middle, high) in a particular country or globally to illustrate this relationship.

Here's how purple is represented and interpreted in computer vision:\n\n### 1. **Color Representation**\n   - **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Purple is created by combining high intensities of red and blue with little to no green. For example:\n     - `RGB(128, 0, 128)` is a common shade of purple.\n     - `RGB(255, 0, 255)` is magenta, which is a brighter, more saturated version of purple.\n   - **HSV/HSL (Hue, Saturation, Value/Lightness)**:\n     - **Hue**: Purple falls in the range of approximately 270\u2013300 degrees in the HSV color space.\n     - **Saturation**: High saturation indicates a vivid purple, while low saturation makes it appear more gray or pastel.\n     - **Value/Lightness**: Adjusts the brightness of the purple.\n\n### 2. **Applications in Computer Vision**\n   - **Object Detection**: Purple can be used to identify specific objects or regions in an image if they are known to be purple (e.g., certain flowers, fabrics, or logos).\n   - **Color Segmentation**: Purple can be isolated in an image using thresholding techniques in the HSV or RGB color space.\n   - **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Purple markers or objects can be tracked for AR applications.\n   - **Medical Imaging**: In some cases, purple dyes or stains are used in medical imaging, and computer vision algorithms can detect these for analysis.\n\n### 3. **Challenges**\n   - **Lighting Conditions**: The perceived color of purple can vary under different lighting, making it harder to detect consistently.\n   - **Shadows and Reflections**: These can alter the appearance of purple in an image.\n   - **Color Similarity**: Purple can be confused with shades of blue or magenta if not properly thresholded.\n\n### 4. **Symbolic or Contextual Meaning**\n   While computer vision focuses on the technical representation of purple, its symbolic meaning (e.g., creativity, luxury) is not directly relevant unless the application involves interpreting emotions or cultural contexts (e.g., in marketing or art analysis).\n\nIf you're working on a specific computer vision task involving purple, let me know, and I can provide more tailored guidance!", "input_token_count": 227, "output_token_count": 495, "latency": 32.86991572380066}

{"id": "irrelevance_166", "result": "Maintaining a piano is essential to ensure its longevity, sound quality, and performance. Here are some key tips to help you take care of your piano:\n\n### 1. **Regular Tuning**\n   - Pianos should be tuned at least twice a year, or more frequently if they are used heavily or exposed to significant temperature or humidity changes.\n   - Professional tuning by a qualified technician is recommended.\n\n### 2. **Control Humidity and Temperature**\n   - Pianos are sensitive to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Aim for a stable environment with:\n     - **Humidity:** 40-50% relative humidity.\n     - **Temperature:** Around 68-72\u00b0F (20-22\u00b0C).\n   - Use a **humidifier** or **dehumidifier** if necessary, or invest in a **piano humidity control system**.\n\n### 3. **Keep It Clean**\n   - Dust the piano regularly with a soft, dry cloth to prevent buildup.\n   - Avoid using harsh chemicals or polishes; instead, use a slightly damp cloth for stubborn dirt.\n   - Clean the keys gently with a damp cloth (water only) and dry immediately.\n\n### 4. **Avoid Direct Sunlight and Heat Sources**\n   - Place the piano away from windows, radiators, or vents to prevent damage from sunlight, heat, or drafts.\n\n### 5. **Proper Placement**\n   - Avoid placing the piano against an exterior wall, as it can be more susceptible to temperature changes.\n   - Ensure the piano is on a level surface to prevent uneven wear.\n\n### 6. **Regular Maintenance**\n   - Schedule regular inspections by a piano technician to check for issues like loose tuning pins, worn hammers, or other mechanical problems.\n   - Address any minor issues promptly to avoid costly repairs later.\n\n### 7. **Play It Regularly**\n   - Regular playing helps keep the piano's internal mechanisms in good condition.\n   - If the piano is unused for long periods, the strings and action may deteriorate faster.\n\n### 8. **Protect the Finish**\n   - Use a piano cover to protect the finish from dust and scratches.\n   - Avoid placing objects on the piano that could scratch or damage the surface.\n\n### 9. **Keep It Away from Liquids and Food**\n   - Spills can damage the wood, keys, and internal components. Keep drinks and food away from the piano.\n\n### 10. **Professional Voicing and Regulation**\n   - Over time, the piano's tone and touch may change. A technician can perform **voicing** (adjusting the tone) and **regulation** (adjusting the mechanical action) to restore its optimal performance.\n\n### 11. **String and Soundboard Care**\n   - If the piano is older, check for rust or corrosion on the strings and soundboard. A technician can treat or replace damaged parts.\n\n### 12. **Avoid DIY Repairs**\n   - Pianos are complex instruments. Avoid attempting repairs yourself unless you are trained, as improper handling can cause irreversible damage.\n\nBy following these tips, you can keep your piano in excellent condition for years to come.

{"id": "irrelevance_171", "result": "In Ancient Greece, the establishment of laws and order varied depending on the city-state (polis) and the time period. Here are some key points about how laws and order were established in Ancient Greece:\n\n### 1. **City-States (Polis)**\n   - Each city-state had its own system of governance and laws. The most famous examples are **Athens** and **Sparta**, which had very different legal and political systems.\n\n### 2. **Lawgivers and Reforms**\n   - **Draco (7th century BCE)**: In Athens, Draco established the first written legal code around 621 BCE. His laws were notoriously harsh (hence the term \"draconian\").\n   - **Solon (6th century BCE)**: Solon reformed Draco's laws and introduced more moderate and democratic measures, including the abolition of debt slavery and the division of citizens into classes based on wealth rather than birth.\n   - **Lycurgus (Sparta)**: Traditionally credited with establishing Sparta's militaristic and austere legal system, though his historicity is debated.\n\n### 3. **Democratic Institutions (Athens)**\n   - In democratic Athens (5th century BCE), laws were proposed by the **Boule** (Council of 500) and voted on by the **Ekklesia** (Assembly of citizens).\n   - The **Heliaia** (people's court) interpreted and enforced laws.\n   - **Ostracism** was a unique practice where citizens could vote to exile a prominent individual for 10 years if deemed a threat to democracy.\n\n### 4. **Oligarchic and Authoritarian Systems**\n   - In Sparta, laws were overseen by the **Gerousia** (Council of Elders) and enforced by the **Ephors** (executive magistrates).\n   - Other city-states, like Corinth or Thebes, had oligarchic or tyrannical rulers who imposed laws.\n\n### 5. **Religious Influence**\n   - Laws were often tied to religious beliefs. For example, the **Oracle of Delphi** was consulted for legal and moral guidance.\n   - Temples and priests played a role in upholding oaths and contracts.\n\n### 6. **Custom and Tradition**\n   - Many laws were based on long-standing customs and traditions, especially in smaller city-states.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- Laws were established by **lawgivers**, **assemblies**, or **rulers** depending on the city-state.\n- The legal systems ranged from **democratic** (Athens) to **authoritarian** (Sparta).\n- Written legal codes emerged in the Archaic period (7th\u20136th centuries BCE).\n\nWould you like more details about a specific city-state or legal system?", "input_token_count": 205, "output_token_count": 569, "latency": 37.72629475593567}

King).\n\n### 4. **Secondary Dominants and Borrowed Chords**\n   - Pop songs sometimes use chords outside the key for added color, such as:\n     - **V/vi (Secondary Dominant)**: Resolves to the vi chord.\n     - **bVII (Borrowed from Mixolydian mode)**: Adds a bluesy or rock feel.\n\n### 5. **Seventh Chords**\n   - While triads are most common, seventh chords (e.g., **I7, IV7, V7**) are also used, especially in jazz-influenced pop or R&B.\n\n### Example in C Major:\n- Common chords: C (I), F (IV), G (V), Am (vi), Dm (ii), Em (iii), and sometimes Bdim (vii\u00b0).\n\nWould you like me to generate the primary triads for a specific key to illustrate this further?", "input_token_count": 199, "output_token_count": 563, "latency": 35.3778281211853}

The game's objective is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved by being the first to play all of your cards in each round. Here are the basic rules:\n\n### **Setup**\n1. **Deck**: The Uno deck consists of 108 cards:\n   - **Number cards**: 0\u20139 in four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), with two of each number (except for 0, which has one of each color).\n   - **Action cards** (two of each in every color):\n     - **Skip**: The next player is skipped.\n     - **Reverse**: The order of play is reversed.\n     - **Draw Two**: The next player draws two cards and loses their turn.\n   - **Wild cards** (four of each):\n     - **Wild**: The player chooses the next color to be played.\n     - **Wild Draw Four**: The player chooses the next color, and the next player draws four cards and loses their turn.\n2. **Players**: 2\u201310 players.\n3. **Dealing**: Each player is dealt 7 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is turned over to start the discard pile.\n\n### **Gameplay**\n1. **Starting the Game**: The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and play proceeds clockwise (unless reversed).\n2. **Playing Cards**: On your turn, you must play a card that matches the top card of the discard pile in:\n   - **Color**,\n   - **Number**, or\n   - **Symbol** (action cards).\n   - If you don't have a matching card, you must draw one from the draw pile. If the drawn card can be played, you may play it; otherwise, your turn ends.\n3. **Wild Cards**: When you play a Wild or Wild Draw Four, you choose the next color to be played.\n   - **Wild Draw Four**: Can only be played if you have no other valid cards to play. If challenged and found to have a matching card, you must draw four instead.\n\n### **Special Rules**\n- **Uno Call**: When you have one card left, you must yell \"Uno!\" before the next player plays. If caught not saying it, you must draw two cards.\n- **Draw Pile Runs Out**: If the draw pile is exhausted, the discard pile (except the top card) is shuffled to form a new draw pile.\n\n### **Winning a Round**\n- The first player to play all their cards wins the round.\n- The winner scores points based on the cards left in opponents' hands:\n  - Number cards: Face value.\n  - Draw Two, Skip, Reverse: 20 points.\n  - Wild, Wild Draw Four: 50 points.\n- The first player to reach 500 points wins the game.\n\n### **Additional Rules**\n- **Stacking**: Some house rules allow stacking Draw Two or Wild Draw Four cards, but this is not part of the official rules.\n- **Penalties**: If a player plays a card illegally (e.g., a Wild Draw Four when they have a matching color), they must draw the penalty cards.\n\nWould you like me to simulate shuffling an Uno deck for practice?", "input_token_count": 220, "output_token_count": 681, "latency": 41.75920104980469}

Here's a step-by-step guide to boiling the perfect egg:\n\n### **Steps to Boil an Egg:**\n1. **Choose Fresh Eggs:**\n   - Fresh eggs are great for frying or poaching, but slightly older eggs (about 7-10 days old) are easier to peel when boiled.\n\n2. **Room Temperature Eggs:**\n   - Let the eggs sit at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes before boiling to prevent cracking.\n\n3. **Use the Right Pot:**\n   - Select a pot that can comfortably hold all the eggs in a single layer without crowding.\n\n4. **Add Water:**\n   - Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the eggs by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).\n\n5. **Bring to a Boil:**\n   - Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil.\n\n6. **Lower the Heat (Optional for Soft-Boiled Eggs):**\n   - For soft-boiled eggs, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer before adding the eggs.\n\n7. **Add the Eggs:**\n   - Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water using a spoon or ladle to avoid cracking.\n\n8. **Set the Timer:**\n   - The cooking time depends on how you like your eggs:\n     - **Soft-boiled (runny yolk):** 4-6 minutes\n     - **Medium-boiled (slightly firm yolk):** 7-9 minutes\n     - **Hard-boiled (fully firm yolk):** 10-12 minutes\n\n9. **Prepare an Ice Bath:**\n   - While the eggs cook, prepare a bowl of ice water.\n\n10. **Cool the Eggs:**\n    - Once the timer goes off, immediately transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Let them sit for at least 5 minutes.\n\n11. **Peel the Eggs:**\n    - Gently tap the egg on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel under running water for easier removal.\n\n### **Tips for Perfect Boiled Eggs:**\n- **Peeling:** Older eggs peel more easily than very fresh ones.\n- **Salt or Vinegar:** Adding a pinch of salt or a splash of vinegar to the water can help prevent cracking and make peeling easier.\n- **Consistency:** For consistent results, use a timer and the same size eggs.\n\nWould you like me to calculate the exact boiling time for your eggs based on their size? If so, let me know the size (small, medium, large, or extra-large) and how you prefer them (soft, medium, or hard-boiled).", "input_token_count": 249, "output_token_count": 576, "latency": 35.82702922821045}
