The description says it extracts entries based on a specified attribute and value, checking for 'data-active' being true. The parameters required are listElement, attribute (optional, default 'data-active'), and value (optional, default true). Since the user specifically mentions 'data-active' and true, the defaults match exactly. So I don't need to specify attribute or value unless they differ. But in this case, the user's request aligns with the defaults. Therefore, the function call should just need the listElement parameter.

The required parameters are filepath, status, encoding, and processFunction. The user provided all except maybe processFunction. Wait, the question mentions using a processing function, but doesn't specify what it is. However, the function's parameters require processFunction to be provided. Since the user says \"process the information with a processing function,\" but doesn't give the function's details, maybe they expect a placeholder or a generic reference. But the function requires it as a parameter. Hmm, but the user might have a specific function in mind. Since it's not provided, perhaps the answer should include a placeholder, like a string representation of the function. Alternatively, maybe the processFunction is optional? Wait, checking the required fields: the required parameters include processFunction. So it's mandatory. But the user hasn't specified what the processing function is. However, the function's description says that processFunction is a JavaScript object in string representation.

Since the user hasn't provided the actual processing function, maybe the answer should still proceed, assuming that the processFunction is provided as a parameter. Wait, the user's question says \"process the information with a processing function,\" but doesn't specify the function's name or code. So perhaps the processFunction is a parameter that needs to be passed, but since it's not given, maybe the answer should include a placeholder. However, the function requires it. So maybe the user expects that the processFunction is a variable or a predefined function. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the answer should still call the function with the given parameters, and the processFunction can be a placeholder. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include it but forgot. But according to the problem statement, if the parameters are missing, I should point it out.

The coordinates need to be an array of two numbers in percentages, represented as a string in JavaScript format.\n\nThe user specified 30% from the top, which would be the y-coordinate, and 60% from the left, the x-coordinate. So the coordinates array should be [60, 30] because in CSS, the x comes first (left) and then y (top). Wait, the description says the coordinates are [x, y], so x is horizontal (left) and y is vertical (top). So 60% from the left is x=60, and 30% from the top is y=30. That makes sense.\n\nSo the parameters would be action: 'submit', formId: 'loginForm', coordinates: [60, 30]. The coordinates need to be a string representation of the array.

The middlewares are an array, and the user mentioned using applyMiddleware('myMiddleWare') as enhancers. Wait, enhancers are an array of strings. So I need to represent applyMiddleware as a string in the enhancers array.\n\nThe context is a React context object, but the user hasn't specified it.

Wait, the user didn't provide a context, but maybe they expect me to use a placeholder or assume it's provided. Hmm, the problem says to assume the existence of the hooks, but the context isn't mentioned. Wait, the function requires context, so maybe I need to create a context object.

So the hooks parameter should be a string representation of a dictionary with those hooks. Like {\"useStateSelector\": \"useStateSelectorHook\", \"useDispatchAction\": \"useDispatchActionHook\"}.\n\nPutting it all together, the store configuration would include initialStateObject, reducersMap, middlewares as an array with loggerMiddleware, and enhancers as the array with applyMiddleware. Wait, the middlewares are an array of strings. The user mentioned a loggerMiddleware, so maybe that's a string. But the enhancers are using applyMiddleware, which is a function.

This is a problem.\n\nWait, the user says to assume the existence of the hooks, but the context is required. Maybe the context is part of the setup that's already handled, so perhaps the user expects me to use a placeholder. But the problem says to write a line of code to initialize the function. So maybe the context is a string representation of an object, like \"React.createContext()\", but that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the context is not needed here, but the function requires it. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the context is not required in this case, but the function's required parameters include it. So I have to include it. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe I should use a placeholder. For example, the context could be a string like \"{}\" or a placeholder name.

The priorityStatus should be 'urgent', and ascending should be 'true' since they want ascending order.

{"id": "javascript_25", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to track the 'submitForm' action on a 'formHandler' object, but only when the form has the validation flags 'isRequired' and 'isValidEmail' set. Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe provided function is trackSubmitWithValidation. Its parameters are 'obj' and 'validationFlags'. The 'obj' is the object with the submitForm action, and 'validationFlags' is an array of flags that need to be set for tracking to occur.\n\nThe user mentioned the object is called 'formHandler', so that's the value for 'obj'. The validation flags required are 'isRequired' and 'isValidEmail'. These should be passed as an array in the 'validationFlags' parameter. Since the function expects the array in JavaScript syntax as a string, I need to represent it correctly. \n\nSo, the parameters would be obj='formHandler' and validationFlags=['isRequired', 'isValidEmail']. But wait, the description says the validationFlags are a JavaScript array in string representation. So maybe I should pass it as a string like \"['isRequired', 'isValidEmail']\". However, looking at the parameters' examples, the 'validationFlags' is a string type, but the description says it's a JavaScript array. Wait, the parameters' type for validationFlags is string, but the description says it's a JavaScript array type parameter in string representation. So perhaps the actual value should be a string that represents the array. For example, if the flags are isRequired and isValidEmail, the validationFlags parameter should be a string like \"['isRequired', 'isValidEmail']\".\n\nBut the required parameters are obj and validationFlags. The user specified that the flags are set, so the function should be called with those flags. Therefore, the correct function call would be trackSubmitWithValidation with obj as 'formHandler' and validationFlags as the array containing 'isRequired' and 'isValidEmail', formatted as a string. \n\nWait, the parameters' 'validationFlags' is of type string, but the description says it's a JavaScript array. So maybe the user is supposed to pass the array as a string. For example, in JavaScript, if you have an array, you can convert it to a string with JSON.stringify, but the function expects the array in string representation. So the correct way would be to pass the array as a string, like \"['isRequired', 'isValidEmail']\".\n\nBut the parameters' 'validationFlags' is a string type. So the function expects a string. Therefore, the correct parameters would be obj='formHandler' and validationFlags='[\"isRequired\", \"isValidEmail\"]' (as a JSON string). However, the description says the list elements are not in string representation. Wait, the description says: \"The list elements are of type String; they are not in string representation.\" So maybe the array is passed as a JavaScript array, but since the parameter is a string, perhaps it's a string that represents the array. For example, if the flags are isRequired and isValidEmail, the validationFlags parameter should be a string like \"['isRequired', 'isValidEmail']\".\n\nBut I need to make sure. The parameters for validationFlags are described as a string, but the elements are strings. So perhaps the correct way is to pass the array as a string in JavaScript syntax. Therefore, the function call would be trackSubmitWithValidation(obj='formHandler', validationFlags='[\"isRequired\", \"isValidEmail\"]').\n\nWait, but the user's question says \"when the form has is required and is valid email validation flags set\". So the flags are isRequired and isValidEmail. So the validationFlags array should include those two. Therefore, the function call should be made with those flags. \n\nSo the final answer is to call trackSubmitWithValidation with obj as 'formHandler' and validationFlags as the array containing 'isRequired' and 'isValidEmail', formatted as a string. Therefore, the function call would be:\n\ntrackSubmitWithValidation(obj='formHandler', validationFlags='[\"isRequired\", \"isValidEmail\"]')\n\nBut I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The parameters are of type dict, with properties obj (string) and validationFlags (string). So the validationFlags is a string, which represents the array. So the correct way is to pass the array as a string. Therefore, the function call is correct as above.\n</think>\n\n[trackSubmitWithValidation(obj='formHandler', validationFlags='[\"isRequired\", \"isValidEmail\"]')]", "input_token_count": 452, "output_token_count": 921, "latency": 29.26473045349121}

The main concerns are that the object shouldn't be a Promise and shouldn't have methods that could cause side effects.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'validateReactProp' which checks exactly those things. The function requires two parameters: 'obj' and 'componentName'. The user provided both the object name 'serviceProvider' and the component name 'UserProfile'. \n\nWait, but the parameters expect the object itself, not just the name. Oh, but the description says the 'obj' parameter can be any JavaScript object in string representation. So maybe the user is passing the variable name as a string? Or perhaps the actual object. But since the function's 'obj' is a string, I should pass the variable name as a string. Wait, no, in JavaScript, when you pass an object as a parameter, it's passed by reference, but here the function's parameter is a string. Maybe the function expects a string representation of the object, like a JSON string. But the user hasn't provided the actual object data. Hmm, but the question says the object is named 'serviceProvider', so maybe the user expects to pass that variable. However, the function's parameters require the object as a string. So perhaps the user needs to convert the object to a string first. But since the user hasn't provided the actual data, maybe the function is designed to take the variable name as a string. Wait, the description says \"the object to validate\" and the parameter is a string. Maybe the function is designed to take the variable name as a string, but that's a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is written in JavaScript and expects the actual object, but the parameter is a string. That doesn't make sense. Wait, the parameters for 'obj' are described as a string, but the actual object could be passed as a string. Maybe the user is supposed to pass the object's string representation. However, the user hasn't provided the actual object data. But the question is about validating the object 'serviceProvider', so perhaps the function is called with the variable name as a string. But I'm not sure. However, given the function's parameters, the user must provide the object as a string. Since the user hasn't provided the actual object data, maybe the function is designed to take the variable name as a string. \n\nWait, the function's 'obj' parameter is a string, but the description says it's the object to validate. So perhaps the user is supposed to pass the object's string representation, like JSON.stringify(serviceProvider). But since the user hasn't provided the actual data, maybe the function is called with the variable name as a string. However, that's not standard. But given the function's parameters, I have to work with what's given. \n\nSo, the user's question is to validate 'serviceProvider' for the 'UserProfile' component. The function requires 'obj' and 'componentName'. The user provided both, so I should call the function with those parameters. Even if the 'obj' is a string, perhaps the user is supposed to pass the variable name as a string. But that's unclear. However, based on the given function definition, the parameters are strings. So the correct call would be validateReactProp with obj='serviceProvider' and componentName='UserProfile'. \n\nWait, but the 'obj' parameter is supposed to be the object itself, not the variable name. So maybe the user needs to pass the actual object. But since the user hasn't provided the object's data, perhaps the function is designed to take the variable name as a string. But that's not standard. However, given the function's parameters, I have to proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's question matches the function's purpose.

The parameters required are events, concurrencyLimit, and callback. The events parameter is an object mapping event names to their functions or arrays of prerequisites. \n\nThe user mentioned 'setupStage' uses setupStageFunction and 'cleanupStage' uses cleanStageFunction. So I should structure the events object so that 'setupStage' has a prerequisite of 'cleanupStage'? Wait, no. Wait, the user says 'setupStage' precedes 'cleanupStage', so 'cleanupStage' should depend on 'setupStage' being completed. So in the events object, 'cleanupStage' should have a prerequisite of 'setupStage'. \n\nWait, the events parameter is an object where each event's value is either an event or an array of prerequisites. So for example, if 'setupStage' has no prerequisites, it's just the function. But 'cleanupStage' depends on 'setupStage', so its prerequisites array would include 'setupStage'. \n\nWait, but the user says 'setupStage' uses setupStageFunction precedes 'cleanupStage' using cleanStageFunction. So maybe each event is a function. So the events object would be something like:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': setupStageFunction,\n  'cleanupStage': cleanStageFunction\n}\n\nBut then, how to specify that 'cleanupStage' depends on 'setupStage'? Oh, right, the events parameter is an object where each event's value is an array of prerequisites. Wait, no. Wait the description says \"events or arrays that define an event and its prerequisites.\" Wait, maybe each event's value is an array where the first element is the function and the rest are prerequisites? Or maybe the event's value is an array of prerequisites, and the function is separate? Hmm, the description is a bit unclear. \n\nWait the function's parameters say events is an object mapping event names to events or arrays that define an event and its prerequisites. So perhaps each event's value is an array where the first element is the function, and the rest are prerequisites. Or maybe the event's value is the function, and prerequisites are specified elsewhere? \n\nWait, maybe the events are defined as objects where each event has a 'fn' property for the function and 'prerequisites' array. But the user's example might not have that. Alternatively, perhaps the events are structured as an array of prerequisites. \n\nWait, the user's example says that 'setupStage' precedes 'cleanupStage', so 'cleanupStage' depends on 'setupStage' being done. So in the events object, 'cleanupStage' should have a prerequisite of 'setupStage'. So the events object would be:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': setupStageFunction,\n  'cleanupStage': [cleanStageFunction, 'setupStage']\n}\n\nWait, but the parameters are in JavaScript syntax. So maybe the events are structured as an object where each key is the event name, and the value is either a function or an array of prerequisites. Wait, perhaps the value is an array where the first element is the function, and the rest are prerequisites. For example:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': [setupStageFunction],\n  'cleanupStage': [cleanStageFunction, 'setupStage']\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the events are defined as an object where each event's value is an array of prerequisites, and the function is passed separately. But the function's parameters say that events is an object mapping event names to events or arrays that define an event and its prerequisites. So perhaps each event's value is an array where the first element is the function, and the rest are prerequisites. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the events are structured as an object where each event's value is the function, and the prerequisites are specified as dependencies. But the way the function is described, the events parameter is an object where each event's value is an array that defines the event and its prerequisites. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The user wants 'setupStage' to run before 'cleanupStage'. So 'cleanupStage' depends on 'setupStage' being completed. So in the events object, 'cleanupStage' should have a prerequisite of 'setupStage'. \n\nAssuming that each event's value is an array where the first element is the function, and the rest are prerequisites. So:\n\nevents: {\n  'setupStage': [setupStageFunction],\n  'cleanupStage': [cleanStageFunction, 'setupStage']\n}\n\nBut the user's question says that 'setupStage' uses setupStageFunction and 'cleanupStage' uses cleanStageFunction. So maybe each event's value is the function, and the prerequisites are specified as dependencies. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the events are structured as an object where each event's value is an array of prerequisites, and the function is passed as a separate parameter. But the function's parameters don't mention that. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for events is a string representation of a JavaScript dict. So perhaps the events are structured as:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': {\n    'fn': setupStageFunction,\n    'prerequisites': []\n  },\n  'cleanupStage': {\n    'fn': cleanStageFunction,\n    'prerequisites': ['setupStage']\n  }\n}\n\nBut the user's question doesn't mention any such structure. The user just says that 'setupStage' uses setupStageFunction and 'cleanupStage' uses cleanStageFunction. So maybe the events are just the functions, and the dependencies are specified as prerequisites. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the events are an array of prerequisites. For example, the events object is:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': setupStageFunction,\n  'cleanupStage': ['setupStage', cleanStageFunction]\n}\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the events are an object where each event's value is an array of prerequisites. So for example, 'setupStage' has no prerequisites, and 'cleanupStage' has 'setupStage' as a prerequisite. But then how is the function associated with the event? \n\nThis is unclear. Maybe the function's description is that the events are an object where each event's value is an array of prerequisites, and the function is passed as a separate parameter. But the function's parameters don't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the events are an object where each event's value is the function, and the prerequisites are specified as dependencies.

So that would fit. \n\nSo the events parameter would be:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': [setupStageFunction],\n  'cleanupStage': [cleanStageFunction, 'setupStage']\n}\n\nBut the user's question says that 'setupStage' precedes 'cleanupStage', so 'cleanupStage' depends on 'setupStage' being completed. So the prerequisites for 'cleanupStage' would be 'setupStage'. \n\nSo the events object would be structured as above. \n\nThen, the concurrencyLimit is 3. The user says \"ensuring only 3 events can happen at the same time\", so concurrencyLimit is 3. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nEventScheduler(events=eventsObject, concurrencyLimit='3')\n\nBut the parameters are in JavaScript syntax. So the events parameter is a string representation of the JavaScript object. \n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\nEventScheduler(events={\"setupStage\": [setupStageFunction], \"cleanupStage\": [cleanStageFunction, \"setupStage\"]}, concurrencyLimit=\"3\")\n\nBut wait, the user's question says that 'setupStage' uses setupStageFunction and 'cleanupStage' uses cleanStageFunction. So the functions are named setupStageFunction and cleanStageFunction. \n\nBut in the events object, the value for 'setupStage' is the function, and the value for 'cleanupStage' is the function plus the prerequisite. \n\nSo the events parameter would be:\n\n{\n  'setupStage': setupStageFunction,\n  'cleanupStage': [cleanStageFunction, 'setupStage']\n}\n\nWait, but the function's parameters say that events is an object mapping event names to events or arrays that define an event and its prerequisites.

But since the user hasn't provided the node's value, maybe they expect the function to be called with the node as a parameter. Wait, the user's question is to update the label of a break node. So the function call would be to updateBreak with the node and label. \n\nBut the user hasn't specified the node's current label. However, the function's logic handles checking if the current label matches the provided one. So the user just needs to pass the node and the desired label.

The user wants to add statements for initializing 'width' and 'height' properties on a 'shape' object into an existing array called 'shapeStatements'.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's the addInitializedPropertyStatements function. Let me look at its parameters. The required ones are statements, property, and receiver. \n\nThe 'statements' parameter is the existing array in string form. The user mentioned 'shapeStatements', so that's the value for 'statements'. The 'property' parameter should be an array of the property names, which are 'width' and 'height'. The 'receiver' is 'shape'.\n\nWait, the parameters expect the arrays to be in JavaScript array syntax. So for 'property', it should be [\"width\", \"height\"], and similarly for 'statements' as [\"shapeStatements\"]. But the description says the statements are a string representation of the array. So maybe the 'statements' parameter should be the string \"['shapeStatements']\"? Or is 'shapeStatements' the name of the array variable?\n\nWait, the function's 'statements' parameter is described as \"the array of statements to which the new statements will be added. This is JavaScript array type parameter in string representation.\" So the user's existing array is named 'shapeStatements', but the parameter expects the array itself as a string. Wait, maybe the 'statements' parameter is the name of the array variable, or the actual array?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the description. The function adds statements to an array of statements. The 'statements' parameter is the array in string representation. For example, if the existing statements are [\"let x = 5;\"], then the parameter would be \"['let x = 5;']\".\n\nBut the user says the existing array is named 'shapeStatements'. So perhaps the 'statements' parameter should be the name of the array variable, like \"shapeStatements\", but that doesn't fit the description. Alternatively, maybe the 'statements' parameter is the array itself as a string. \n\nWait, the parameters for 'statements' are described as \"JavaScript array type parameter in string representation. The list elements are of type String; they are not in string representation.\" So for example, if the existing statements are [\"statement1\", \"statement2\"], then the 'statements' parameter would be \"['statement1', 'statement2']\".\n\nBut the user's existing array is named 'shapeStatements', which is a variable. So perhaps the 'statements' parameter should be the string representation of that array. But the user hasn't provided the current contents of 'shapeStatements'. However, the function's purpose is to add to it. So maybe the 'statements' parameter is the name of the array variable, and the function appends the new statements to it. But the description isn't entirely clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'statements' parameter is the array itself as a string. For example, if the existing array is [\"stmt1\", \"stmt2\"], then the parameter is \"['stmt1', 'stmt2']\".\n\nAssuming that the user's 'shapeStatements' is the array variable, and the function expects the array as a string, then the 'statements' parameter would be the string representation of that array. However, since the user hasn't provided the current contents, perhaps the function is designed to take the array name as a string. But the description says the parameter is the array in string representation.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the function's parameters, I'll proceed with the information given. The user wants to add the initialized properties to 'shapeStatements', so the 'statements' parameter should be the existing array. But since the user hasn't provided its contents, maybe the function is designed to take the array name as a string. However, the function's parameters require the array as a string. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'statements' parameter is the name of the array variable, and the function appends the new statements to it. But the description says it's the array in string representation. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the function's parameters, I'll proceed with the following:\n\n- 'statements' is the existing array as a string. Since the user hasn't provided its contents, maybe it's just the name of the array variable, but that's unclear. However, the function requires it, so perhaps the user expects that 'shapeStatements' is the array variable, and the function will append to it. \n\nBut the function's parameters require the 'statements' to be a string representation of the array. So if the existing array is [\"let x = 5;\"], then 'statements' would be \"['let x = 5;']\".\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the current contents of 'shapeStatements', so perhaps the function is designed to take the array name as a string. However, the description says it's the array in string representation. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. But given the information, I'll proceed with the parameters as per the user's question. The user says \"into an existing statements array named 'shapeStatements'\", so the 'statements' parameter should be the name of the array, which is 'shapeStatements'. But the function's parameters require the array as a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'statements' parameter is the array variable's name as a string. For example, if the array is called 'shapeStatements', then the parameter is \"shapeStatements\". But the description says it's the array in string representation. \n\nThis is confusing, but given the function's parameters, I'll proceed with the following:\n\n- statements: \"shapeStatements\" (assuming it's the array variable's name)\n- property: [\"width\", \"height\"]\n- receiver: \"shape\"\n\nBut the function's parameters require 'statements' to be a string representation of the array. So if the existing array is, say, [\"stmt1\", \"stmt2\"], then 'statements' would be \"['stmt1', 'stmt2']\".\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the current contents of 'shapeStatements', so perhaps the function is designed to take the array name as a string.

So if the array is named 'shapeStatements', perhaps the parameter is the string \"shapeStatements\".

The 'property' is an array of strings, and the 'receiver' is a string.

The function provided is assignOwnDefaults. The description says it checks if the object has its own value for the key. If it does and it's not undefined, use that. Otherwise, use the source value.\n\nIn this case, the configuration object does not have 'maxItems' defined.

The user's request requires logging when the queue is saturated or unsaturated, which implies event handling. But the function B's parameters don't include an event handler.

But the user wants to log when the queue is saturated or unsaturated, which are events. If the function B's event handling is not customizable, then the user's requirement can't be fulfilled. However, the user might have to assume that the function B's event handling is set up to trigger those logs automatically. \n\nAssuming that the function B can handle those events, the main thing is to set up the concurrency and the tasks. So the parameters would be e as the task functions, t as \"5\". The user didn't specify the payload size, so n can be omitted or set to default. \n\nSo the function call would be B with e as the task functions, t as \"5\". But how to represent the tasks as strings. For example, if the tasks are functions that log messages, then e could be an array of such functions. So maybe e is \"[function() { console.log('Task message'); }]\" or similar. \n\nBut the user might not have provided the exact task functions, so perhaps the e parameter can be a string representing the tasks. However, the exact format isn't clear. But given the function's parameters, that's the best approach. \n\nSo the final function call would be B with e as the tasks, t as \"5\", and maybe n as \"0\" if needed. But since n is optional, maybe it's not required. \n\nSo the answer would be to call function B with e set to the task functions, t as \"5\", and possibly other parameters if needed. However, the user's requirement about logging when saturated or unsaturated might not be fully covered by the function's parameters, but the function's description mentions event handling, so perhaps those logs are handled internally. Therefore, the main step is to set up the queue with concurrency 5 and the tasks.\n</think>\n\n[B(e=\"[function() { console.log('Task message'); }]\", t=\"5\")]", "input_token_count": 488, "output_token_count": 828, "latency": 26.85530424118042}

The callback is 'processResult', error is 'null', and value is 'Operation successful'. I need to format these into the function call correctly. \n\nWait, the parameters are all strings.

The description says it's for performing a custom operation during tree traversal by executing a callback with the node and state object. \n\nSo, the parameters required for skipThrough are node, st (state), and c (callback). The user provided the node as 'currentNode', the state as 'nodeState', and the callback as 'processNode'. \n\nI need to map these directly into the function parameters. The node parameter in skipThrough corresponds to the current node, which is 'currentNode'. The st parameter is the state object, which is 'nodeState'. The c parameter is the callback function, which is 'processNode'. \n\nAll required parameters are provided, so I can call the skipThrough function with these values. There's no missing information here.

The user wants to asynchronously retrieve a map of remote Git references and their commit hashes for the repository URL 'https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry' starting from the directory '/home/user/projects'.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's the 'Sde' function. The description says it's an asynchronous function that does exactly that. The parameters required are 't' and 'e'. \n\nThe 't' parameter is the repository URL, which the user provided as 'https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry'. That's straightforward. \n\nThe 'e' parameter is the execution context, which is a dictionary in JavaScript. The required part of this dictionary is 'startingCwd', which should be the starting directory. The user specified '/home/user/projects' for that. So I need to structure the 'e' parameter as a dictionary with 'startingCwd' set to that path. \n\nWait, the 'e' parameter's description mentions that the dictionary entries are not in string representation. So I should format it as a JSON object with the correct keys. The 'configuration' part is optional, but since the user didn't mention any additional config, maybe I can omit that. \n\nSo putting it all together, the function call should have 't' as the URL and 'e' as the execution context with 'startingCwd' set to the given directory. Let me make sure all required parameters are included. The 'required' fields for 'e' include 'startingCwd', which I have. The 't' is required as well. \n\nI think that's all.

The question is about converting 'plaintext-only' into a boolean string. But wait, the function provided is called convertEnumeratedValue, which converts a key-value pair to 'true' or 'false' based on certain conditions. \n\nThe parameters needed are key and value. The user's key here is 'contenteditable', and the value is 'plaintext-only'. The function's description mentions handling falsy values and the string 'false', but also specifically mentions validating the 'contenteditable' attribute's value. \n\nSo, I should call the convertEnumeratedValue function with key='contenteditable' and value='plaintext-only'. The function should check if 'plaintext-only' is a valid value. Since 'plaintext-only' is a valid value for contenteditable, the function might return 'false' or 'true'? Wait, no. The contenteditable attribute's possible values are \"true\", \"false\", or \"plaintext-only\". So when the value is 'plaintext-only', it's not a boolean but a specific value. However, the function's purpose is to convert to 'true' or 'false' based on conditions. \n\nWait, the function's description says it handles falsy values and the string 'false', and validates the contenteditable value. Maybe if the value is 'plaintext-only', the function would return 'false'? Or maybe it's considered a valid value but not a boolean. The user wants to ensure it's a valid value. So perhaps the function will check if 'plaintext-only' is a valid value for contenteditable and return the appropriate boolean string. But I'm not sure. The function's exact logic isn't given, but based on the description, I should use it with the key and value provided. \n\nSo the correct function call would be convertEnumeratedValue with key='contenteditable' and value='plaintext-only'.
