The monitor is a DBRProgressMonitor, which the user provided as `dbMonitor`. The view is a GenericTableBase object, but the user didn't specify that. Wait, the user mentioned the view name 'EmployeeView', so maybe the view parameter should be that name? But the function expects a Java object in string representation.

The description says the view is a GenericTableBase object, but in the parameters, it's a string. So perhaps the view parameter is the name of the view as a string. The user provided the view name 'EmployeeView', so that should be the value for the view parameter. The source is the SQL provided.

The function's parameters don't have options for these settings. The function's description says it sets up properties and listeners, but the parameters don't include those specifics. So maybe those properties are handled internally by the function based on the controller or parent? Or perhaps the function's parameters are just the controller and parent, and the other settings are default or configured elsewhere.\n\nBut the user is asking to ensure those settings. Since the function's parameters don't include options for read-only, multi-line, or scrolling, maybe the function itself handles those by default. However, the user might need to confirm that these settings are applied. But according to the function's parameters, there's no way to specify them. So maybe the function is designed to handle those properties internally, and the user just needs to pass the controller and parent. \n\nTherefore, the correct call would be to use PlainTextPresentation.createPresentation with controller='dataController' and parent='compositeParent'. The other settings might be handled by the function's internal logic. Since the function's parameters don't allow specifying those, the user's request can't be fully met with the given function.

The monitor is given as 'progressTracker', which I assume is an instance of a monitor class. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires all three, and the user provided all. So the correct call would be EFSNIOResource.copy with those parameters.

So in Java, it would be new Path(\"/backup/data.txt\"), but the parameter expects a string representation. So the destination should be \"new Path(\\\"/backup/data.txt\\\")\" or similar.

However, the description says it defaults to get ByteBuffer.allocate method for 1024 bytes. So maybe in the function call, I can omit buffer, but the parameters list says it's required. Hmm, the parameters required include buffer. So I need to include it. But how? The user hasn't provided a buffer, so maybe the default is acceptable. But the function's parameters require it. So perhaps the function expects the buffer to be passed, but the default is handled internally.

The parameters are in Java 8 SDK syntax, but the user is asking for a function call, so I need to structure it correctly.\n\nThe user has `webModel` as the model and `userRequest` as the HTTP request. The `userRequest` has a 'username' parameter set to 'john_doe'. The function's `request` parameter expects an HttpServletRequest object. Since the user provided `userRequest`, I can pass that directly. The model is `webModel`, so I should pass that as well.\n\nWait, the parameters are in string representation. So the function call should be `PersonController.personal(model='webModel', request='userRequest')`. But the user might need to ensure that the parameters are correctly formatted as Java objects. However, based on the given info, this seems like the correct call. The function will add the user info to the model and return the view name. So the answer is to call that function with the provided model and request.\n</think>\n\n[PersonController.personal(model='webModel', request='userRequest')]", "input_token_count": 430, "output_token_count": 304, "latency": 9.71427869796753}

The description says it updates the config ensuring the outer adapter key stays the same. That matches the user's requirement.\n\nSo, I need to call this function with fileName as 'user-mapping.yml' and config as newMappingConfig. The parameters are both required, and the user provided both. The function is in Java syntax, but the parameters are passed as strings. Wait, the parameters are described as Java String type parameters in string representation. Does that mean I need to serialize the config object into a string? The user provided newMappingConfig as an object, but the function expects a string. Hmm, maybe the user is supposed to pass the config as a stringified JSON or similar. But the user's input just says 'newMappingConfig' as the object. Assuming that the user has already prepared the config as a string, perhaps in JSON format, then the function call would be correct. \n\nSo the correct function call would be HbaseAdapter.updateConfig with fileName='user-mapping.yml' and config=newMappingConfig.

They want the error logged with the message 'something goes wrong with channel' and then close the channel.\n\nLooking at the available functions, there's the `SessionHandler.exceptionCaught` method. Its parameters are `ctx` and `e`, which are the ChannelHandlerContext and the ExceptionEvent. The description says it logs the error and closes the channel. \n\nThe user provided specific values: `nettyChannelContext` as the context and `ioExceptionEvent` as the exception event. The error message they want is 'something goes wrong with channel'. Wait, but the function's parameters don't mention a message parameter. The function's parameters are ctx and e, which are strings representing the objects. So maybe the message is part of the exception event itself. \n\nBut the user wants to log that specific message. Hmm, the function's description says it logs the error, but maybe the message is included in the exception event. Since the user provided the exception event as `ioExceptionEvent`, perhaps that event already contains the message. Alternatively, maybe the function uses the exception's message. However, the user's instruction specifies the message, so maybe the function allows passing it. Wait, checking the parameters again: the function's parameters are ctx and e, both required. There's no message parameter in the function. \n\nWait, maybe the exception event `ioExceptionEvent` is an instance of an exception that has a message. So when we pass that event, the function would log the message from the exception. But the user wants the message to be exactly 'something goes wrong with channel'. So perhaps the exception event they provided already has that message. Or maybe the function's logging is customizable, but according to the function's parameters, there's no way to specify the message. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to log the error with that message. Since the function's parameters don't include a message, maybe the function is designed to log the exception's message automatically. Therefore, the user's provided exception event must already have that message. Alternatively, maybe the function's logging is fixed, but the user's message is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the function's description says it logs the error, but the actual message is determined by the exception. So if the user's exception event has the message 'something goes wrong with channel', then passing that event would log it. But the user might not have that. However, the user is providing the exception event as `ioExceptionEvent`, which might be a placeholder. \n\nIn any case, the function requires ctx and e. The user provided both: `nettyChannelContext` as ctx and `ioExceptionEvent` as e. So the correct function call would be SessionHandler.exceptionCaught with those parameters.

The 'ids' should be a list of longs, but the parameter expects a string representation of an ArrayList. Wait, the description says the list elements are of type long, not strings. So even though the parameter is a string, the actual values should be longs. But the user provided the IDs as a list in JSON format. Wait, the parameters' examples might be in Java syntax. So in Java, the ids would be an ArrayList of Longs. But when passing as a string, maybe they need to be in a specific format, like comma-separated strings? Wait, the parameters' 'ids' is a string type, but the description says the list elements are long. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the user should pass the IDs as a comma-separated string of numbers. For example, \"101,202,303\". Similarly, the newStatus is a string representing an integer.

Maybe the actual parameter expects a JSON array string? Like \"[101, 202, 303]\"? But the description says it's Java ArrayList type parameter in string representation. So in Java, it would be something like Arrays.toString(ids), which would be \"[101, 202, 303]\". But the user is probably supposed to pass the IDs as a comma-separated string. However, the exact format might depend on how the function is implemented. Since the user hasn't specified, I'll assume that the IDs should be passed as a comma-separated string.

The proxy connection is proxyConn.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the parameters required for the ProxyConnection.prepareCall method. The function requires sql, resultSetType, concurrency, and holdability. All are required.\n\nThe SQL statement here is a CALL to totalSales with a parameter, so the sql parameter should be \"{call totalSales(?)}\". I remember that in Java, callable statements use the {call} syntax.\n\nNext, the resultSetType. The user wants scroll insensitive, which corresponds to ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE. The value for that is usually an integer, but the parameter expects a string representation. So I need to check what the integer value is. From Java docs, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE is 1003. So resultSetType should be \"1003\".\n\nConcurrency is read only, which is ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY. That's integer 1003 as well. Wait, no. Wait, CONCUR_READ_ONLY is 1003? Wait, no. Wait, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY is 1003? Let me think. Wait, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY is 1003? Or is it 1002? Wait, no. Let me recall: ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY is 1003? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, the actual values are: \n\nTYPE_FORWARD_ONLY is 1003, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE is 1002, TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE is 1001? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Wait, I think the correct values are:\n\nResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY is 1003, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE is 1002, and TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE is 1001. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should check. Wait, according to Java docs, the constants are:\n\npublic static final int TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY = 1003;\npublic static final int TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE = 1002;\npublic static final int TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE = 1001;\n\nSo for scroll insensitive, the value is 1002. So the user wants resultSetType to be TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, which is 1002. So the parameter should be \"1002\".\n\nThen concurrency is read only, which is CONCUR_READ_ONLY, which is 1003. Wait, no. Wait, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY is 1003? Or is it 1002? Let me check again. The constants are:\n\nCONCUR_READ_ONLY is 1003, and CONCUR_UPDATABLE is 1002. Wait, no. Wait, the actual values are:\n\npublic static final int CONCUR_READ_ONLY = 1003;\npublic static final int CONCUR_UPDATABLE = 1002;\n\nSo for concurrency, since the user wants read only, it's CONCUR_READ_ONLY, which is 1003. So the concurrency parameter is \"1003\".\n\nHoldability is close cursors at commit, which is ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT. The value for that is 2. So holdability should be \"2\".\n\nPutting it all together, the function call would be:\n\nProxyConnection.prepareCall with sql=\"{call totalSales(?)}\", resultSetType=\"1002\", concurrency=\"1003\", holdability=\"2\".\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"close cursors at commit\", which is CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT, which is 2.

The user provided the array in Python list format, but the function expects a Java array string. So I should convert the Python list to a Java array string representation. For example, in Java, it would be written as \"[2, 7, 11, 15]\". Similarly, the target is 9, which as a Java integer string is just \"9\". \n\nSo the correct parameters would be nums=\"2, 7, 11, 15\" (without the brackets maybe?

Because if the lease time is 2 minutes, but the unit is SECONDS, then leaseTime should be 120 seconds. But the user said lease time of 2 minutes and unit SECONDS. So maybe they made a mistake here. But the user's instruction is to use the given parameters as per their request. So perhaps they intended to have waitTime in seconds (5 seconds) and leaseTime in minutes? But the unit is specified as SECONDS. Hmm, but the function's parameters require that both waitTime and leaseTime are in the same unit.

{"id": "java_34", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to schedule a cleanup task to run after 5 minutes using a timer in a service manager. They mentioned the task is represented by the `cleanupTask` TimerTask object. Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe available function is ServiceManager.newTimeout. The parameters required are task, delay, and unit. The task is the TimerTask, which in this case is cleanupTask. The delay is 5 minutes, so I need to convert that into the appropriate unit. Since the unit parameter can be TimeUnit.SECONDS, but the delay is 5 minutes, I should calculate that as 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. Wait, but maybe the user wants the delay in minutes. Wait, the function's unit parameter is a TimeUnit, so if they want 5 minutes, the delay should be 5 and the unit should be TimeUnit.MINUTES. Let me check the function's parameters again. The delay is a string representing a Java long, and the unit is a TimeUnit. So if the user says 5 minutes, the delay should be 5 and the unit is TimeUnit.MINUTES. But the user might have intended to use seconds. Wait, the question says \"after 5 minutes\", so the correct approach is to set delay to 5 and unit to TimeUnit.MINUTES. However, the function's parameters require the unit to be a string representation of the TimeUnit. For example, TimeUnit.MINUTES is a valid value. So the parameters would be task=cleanupTask, delay=5, unit=TimeUnit.MINUTES. But wait, the user might have a different setup. Let me make sure. The user says \"after 5 minutes\", so the delay is 5 minutes. Therefore, the correct parameters are task as cleanupTask, delay as \"5\", and unit as \"TimeUnit.MINUTES\". But the function's parameters expect the delay as a string in Java long type. Wait, the delay parameter's description says it's a Java long type parameter in string representation. So the delay should be a string like \"5\", but if the unit is minutes, then 5 minutes is 300 seconds. Wait, no. The delay is in the unit specified. So if the unit is TimeUnit.MINUTES, then delay is 5. If the unit is TimeUnit.SECONDS, delay is 300. So the user wants 5 minutes, so the correct parameters are delay=5 and unit=TimeUnit.MINUTES. Therefore, the function call should be ServiceManager.newTimeout with task=cleanupTask, delay=\"5\", unit=\"TimeUnit.MINUTES\". But I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The task is a string representation of the TimerTask object, which is \"cleanupTask\". The delay is a string of the long value, so \"5\". The unit is the string \"TimeUnit.MINUTES\". So the function call would be ServiceManager.newTimeout(task=\"cleanupTask\", delay=\"5\", unit=\"TimeUnit.MINUTES\"). That should schedule the task to run after 5 minutes. Also, the function mentions that if the service manager is shutting down, it returns a dummy timeout, but that's handled by the function. So the correct call is as above.\n</think>\n\n[ServiceManager.newTimeout(task=\"cleanupTask\", delay=\"300\", unit=\"TimeUnit.SECONDS\")]", "input_token_count": 458, "output_token_count": 690, "latency": 21.828498363494873}

The user wants to perform a bitwise AND operation on two Redis keys: 'user:online:today' and 'user:online:yesterday', and store the result in 'user:online:both' using Redisson.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is RedissonConnection.bitOp. The parameters required are op, destination, and keys. The op is a BitOperation enum value, like OR, AND, etc. The destination is the key where the result will be stored, and keys is an array of the source keys.\n\nWait, the description mentions that the NOT operation isn't supported for multiple sources. But the user is asking for AND, which should be supported. The parameters for keys and destination are Java Array types, but in the function's parameters, they are represented as strings. The user's example uses Java 8 SDK syntax, so I need to format the parameters correctly.\n\nSo, the op should be BitOperation.AND. The destination key is 'user:online:both'. The keys array should include the two source keys. But how to represent the array in the parameters? The function's parameters say that keys and destination are Java Array type parameters in string representation. Wait, the destination is a Java Array type parameter in string representation, but the description says the list elements are of type String and not in string representation. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the parameters for RedissonConnection.bitOp: the 'destination' is a string, but the description says it's a Java Array type parameter in string representation. Wait, that might be a confusion. Wait, the parameters for 'destination' and 'keys' are described as Java Array type parameters in string representation. But the example given for 'destination' says the list elements are of type String and not in string representation. Maybe that's a typo. For example, if the destination is a single key, but the function expects an array. Wait, no. The function's parameters for 'destination' is a string, but the description says it's a Java Array type parameter in string representation. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the parameters are actually expecting arrays, but in the function's parameters, they are represented as strings. Wait, perhaps the parameters are passed as Java arrays, but when converting to JSON, they are represented as strings. But the user is supposed to pass them as arrays. However, the function's parameters are defined as strings. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the parameters are actually expecting arrays, but the JSON schema is incorrect. For example, the 'keys' parameter is a string that represents an array of keys. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parameters are supposed to be passed as Java arrays, but when converting to the function call, they are represented as strings. For example, the 'keys' parameter would be a string like \"['key1', 'key2']\". But the user's question is about using Redisson, which is a Java library. So the actual function call in Java would use arrays. However, the function here is represented in JSON, and the parameters are strings. So maybe the 'keys' parameter is a string that represents an array of keys, like a JSON array. But the description says the list elements are of type String and not in string representation. So perhaps the keys are passed as a list of strings, but in the function call, they are represented as a string. \n\nWait, the user is supposed to call the function with parameters. Let me think. The function is RedissonConnection.bitOp. The parameters are op, destination, keys. The 'keys' is a Java Array type parameter in string representation. So perhaps the keys are passed as a string that represents an array. For example, in Java, you'd pass an array, but here, the function expects a string representation of that array. So for the keys, the user would need to pass something like \"['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday']\". Similarly, the destination is a single key, but the description says it's a Java Array type parameter in string representation. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the destination is a single key, but the keys parameter is an array. Wait, the function's parameters are op, destination, keys. The 'destination' is a string, and 'keys' is a string representing an array. So for the user's case, the destination is 'user:online:both', and the keys are an array containing the two keys. \n\nSo the function call would be:\n\nRedissonConnection.bitOp(op=BitOperation.AND, destination='user:online:both', keys=['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday'])\n\nBut according to the parameters, the keys are a string in Java Array type representation. So maybe the keys parameter should be a string like \"user:online:today,user:online:yesterday\" or in a JSON array format. However, the description says the list elements are of type String and not in string representation. So perhaps the keys are passed as a comma-separated string. But the function's parameters are defined as strings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are passed as a Java array, but in the function call, they are represented as a string. For example, in Java, you'd pass new String[] {\"key1\", \"key2\"}, but here, the function expects a string representation of that array. So the keys parameter would be a string like \"['key1', 'key2']\". \n\nBut the user is using Redisson, which is a Java library. The function's parameters are in Java 8 SDK syntax. So the actual function call in Java would be something like:\n\nRedissonConnection.bitOp(BitOperation.AND, \"user:online:both\", new String[] {\"user:online:today\", \"user:online:yesterday\"});\n\nBut the user is supposed to make a function call in the format specified. The parameters for the function are op, destination, keys. The keys are a Java Array type parameter in string representation. So the keys parameter should be a string that represents the array. So perhaps the keys are passed as a comma-separated string, like \"user:online:today,user:online:yesterday\". \n\nBut the description says that the list elements are of type String and not in string representation. So maybe the keys are passed as a list of strings, but in the function call, they are represented as a string. For example, the keys parameter would be a string like \"['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday']\". \n\nBut the user's question is about using Redisson, and the function is part of Redisson's API. So the correct way to call this function would be to pass the op as BitOperation.AND, the destination as the key where the result is stored, and the keys as an array of the source keys. \n\nSo the correct function call would be:\n\nRedissonConnection.bitOp(op=BitOperation.AND, destination='user:online:both', keys=['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday'])\n\nBut according to the parameters, the keys are a string in Java Array type representation. So perhaps the keys should be passed as a string like \"user:online:today,user:online:yesterday\" or in a JSON array format. However, the function's parameters are defined as strings, so the keys parameter is a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are passed as a list of strings, but in the function call, they are represented as a string. For example, the keys parameter would be a string that represents the array. \n\nIn any case, the user's question is to perform a bitwise AND on the two keys and store the result in the destination. The function requires op, destination, and keys. The op should be BitOperation.AND. The destination is 'user:online:both', and the keys are the two source keys. \n\nSo the function call should be:\n\n[RedissonConnection.bitOp(op='BitOperation.AND', destination='user:online:both', keys=['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday'])]\n\nBut I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted. The 'op' parameter is a BitOperation enum value. In Java, it would be BitOperation.AND, but in the function's parameters, it's represented as a string. So the op parameter should be 'BitOperation.AND' as a string. \n\nWait, the function's parameters say that op is a string representing the BitOperation enum value. So the op parameter should be the string 'BitOperation.AND'. \n\nSo the final function call would be:\n\n[RedissonConnection.bitOp(op='BitOperation.AND', destination='user:online:both', keys=['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday'])]\n\nBut the keys parameter is a Java Array type parameter in string representation. So perhaps the keys should be passed as a string that represents an array. For example, in Java, it's an array, but here, it's a string. So maybe the keys are passed as a comma-separated string. \n\nAlternatively, the keys parameter is a list of strings, but in the function call, they are represented as a string.

So perhaps the keys are passed as a list of strings, but in the function call, they are represented as a string. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the information, the correct approach is to use the parameters as described. The user's question is to perform the operation, so the function call should include the op as BitOperation.AND, the destination as the target key, and the keys as the array of source keys. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is as above.\n</think>\n\n[RedissonConnection.bitOp(op='BitOperation.AND', destination='user:online:both', keys=['user:online:today', 'user:online:yesterday'])]", "input_token_count": 510, "output_token_count": 2096, "latency": 66.74688839912415}

Its description says it checks if the injected invoker in the CSM instance is hidden, same module as the expected class, and appears before it on the stack. The parameters required are 'csm' and 'expected', which are the CSM instance and the expected class as strings.\n\nThe user mentioned the CSM instance is named csmInstance and the expected class is MyExpectedClass.class. So I need to pass these two parameters. The function seems to fit the requirement. Let me make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The CSM instance is a Java object in string representation, so maybe it's just the variable name as a string. Similarly, the expected class is MyExpectedClass.class, which in Java would be represented as the fully qualified name with the .class suffix. \n\nWait, in the parameters, the 'expected' is a string representing the Java object. So for MyExpectedClass.class, the string should be \"MyExpectedClass.class\". But maybe the user intended the fully qualified name, like \"com.example.MyExpectedClass\". However, the user wrote MyExpectedClass.class, so perhaps it's in the default package or they want the exact string. Either way, the function expects a string. \n\nSo the function call should be checkInjectedInvoker with csm=csmInstance and expected=MyExpectedClass.class.

Since the user provided the start of the string, maybe they expect that the entire 1024 characters are used. However, in the example, the user might have truncated it.

Wait, maybe the function is designed to accept 'true' or 'false' strings, but the user is using 'yes' which might not be valid. However, the function's parameters are 'value' and 'defaultValue'.

But according to the function's description, the default is 'true' for other cases unless a default is provided.

Wait, the function's 'defaultValue' is the default if the 'value' is null. So if the 'value' is not null, the 'defaultValue' is not used. So in this case, the 'value' is 'yes', which is not null. So the function will parse 'yes' into a boolean. But according to the function's description, if the string is not a valid 'false' representation, it defaults to 'true'. So 'yes' would be parsed as 'true' unless the 'defaultValue' is provided. But the user wants to default to 'false' if the setting is not specified. So in this case, the 'value' is 'yes', so the 'defaultValue' is not needed. Wait, but the user's question says that if the setting is not specified, default to 'false'.

So in this case, the 'value' is 'yes', so the 'defaultValue' is not used. Therefore, the function would return 'true' for 'yes'. But the user's question is to determine the boolean value of 'yes' and default to 'false' if not specified. So the function call would be Booleans.parseBooleanLenient(value='yes', defaultValue='false')? Or is the 'defaultValue' not needed here?

Since the user mentioned using the terminal interface for output, perhaps the terminal parameter is a reference to the terminal object. But since the user hasn't provided a specific object, maybe the answer should just use the parameters as given, assuming that the terminal is available.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call would be TruncateTranslogAction.execute with the three parameters: terminal, shardPath, and indexDirectory.

{"id": "java_60", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to build a nested query in Elasticsearch using the NestedQueryBuilder.doBuild method. They mentioned a search context called mainSearchContext and an inner hits context hitsContext for the nested path 'user.address'. Also, they want to ensure that unmapped paths are not ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required by the function. The function requires parentSearchContext and innerHitsContext. The user provided both, so that's covered. The nested path here is 'user.address', but the function parameters don't mention the nested path directly. Wait, the function's description says it updates the inner hits context based on the nested query. Maybe the nested path is part of the parentSearchContext or innerHitsContext parameters? But the parameters are described as strings representing Java objects. \n\nWait, the function's parameters are parentSearchContext and innerHitsContext, which are strings. The user's question mentions the nested path 'user.address', but the function doesn't have a parameter for the nested path. Hmm, maybe the nested path is handled internally by the function based on the context? Or perhaps the parameters provided by the user (mainSearchContext and hitsContext) already include the nested path information. \n\nThe user also mentioned ensuring that unmapped paths are not ignored. The function's description says it throws an IOException if the nested path is not mapped and ignoreUnmapped is false. So, the function's behavior depends on the ignoreUnmapped setting. But the parameters for the function don't include that setting. So maybe the function's default behavior is to not ignore unmapped paths, and the user's requirement is already met by default. \n\nWait, the user wants to ensure that unmapped paths are not ignored. The function's note says that if the nested path is not mapped and ignoreUnmapped is false, it throws an exception. So if the function is called without specifying ignoreUnmapped, perhaps it's set to false by default. Therefore, the user's requirement is already handled. \n\nSo the main task is to call NestedQueryBuilder.doBuild with the given parentSearchContext as 'mainSearchContext' and innerHitsContext as 'hitsContext'. The nested path 'user.address' might be part of the contexts provided, or maybe the function uses the contexts to determine the nested path. Since the parameters are strings representing Java objects, perhaps the user is expected to pass the correct contexts that already include the nested path information. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call would be to use the provided contexts. The user didn't mention any other parameters, so I should proceed with the given parameters. The function doesn't have a parameter for the nested path, so maybe that's handled elsewhere. \n\nSo the final answer is to call NestedQueryBuilder.doBuild with parentSearchContext='mainSearchContext' and innerHitsContext='hitsContext'.\n</think>\n\n[NestedQueryBuilder.doBuild(parentSearchContext=\"mainSearchContext\", innerHitsContext=\"hitsContext\")]", "input_token_count": 451, "output_token_count": 604, "latency": 19.288026809692383}

So I need to include all the required ones. The parameters are supposed to be in Java String representation. So I'll map each parameter accordingly.

The from value is 20.5, and to is 30.0. Now, includeFrom should be true since they want to include the lower bound.

The function requires 'builder' and 'params'. The 'builder' is an XContentBuilder instance, which the user has provided as xContentBuilderInstance. That's covered.\n\nThe 'params' parameter is a list of parameters controlling serialization. The user wants to include defaults for certain settings and skip runtime fields. Looking at the function's description, the 'params' list should include options for including defaults and skipping runtime fields. \n\nWait, the parameters for 'params' are Java ArrayList elements. The user needs to specify whether to include defaults and skip runtime fields. So, the 'params' list should have elements that set includeDefaults to true and skipRuntimeFields to true. But how are these parameters structured? Maybe as a list of key-value pairs. For example, including \"include_defaults\": true and \"skip_runtime_fields\": true. But since the function expects the params as a Java ArrayList in string representation, I need to represent these as a list of strings or objects. However, the user might not have specified the exact structure, but based on the function's parameters, the 'params' is a string representing the ArrayList. \n\nAssuming that the 'params' list should include the necessary options, the user needs to pass a list that includes the parameters for includeDefaults and skipRuntimeFields. So, the 'params' parameter would be something like [\"include_defaults=true\", \"skip_runtime_fields=true\"], but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a list of objects with keys. But since the user is using Java 8 SDK syntax, perhaps the params are passed as a list of strings with the parameters. \n\nIn any case, the user's question requires setting includeDefaults to true to include the default settings for dynamic date formats, templates, date detection, and numeric detection.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact path, perhaps I should leave it as a parameter or note that it's required. However, the function requires the params, so I need to include necessary keys.\n\nThe required parameters for the function are appLocation and params. Since the user hasn't provided the background image path, maybe I should include a placeholder or ask for it. But the user's question doesn't mention it, so perhaps they expect me to use the given info. Wait, the user says \"with a custom background image\" but doesn't specify the file path.

The buf is the array `durations`, which is a Java array represented as a string. The start and end indices are 2 and 5 respectively. But wait, in Java, array indices are zero-based. The user mentioned indexes 2 to 5, which would be elements at positions 2, 3, 4, 5. But the end parameter in the function is exclusive or inclusive? The description says \"from start to end\", so I need to check. The function's parameters specify start and end as the subarray's starting and ending indices. Assuming that the end is inclusive, but in Java's array slicing, it's usually exclusive. However, the function's documentation isn't clear. But the user specified indexes 2 to 5, so maybe they mean from index 2 up to and including 5. So the start is 2, end is 5. But I should confirm if the function expects end to be exclusive. Since the user's question says \"from index 2 to index 5\", it's safer to assume that the subarray includes indices 2, 3, 4, 5. Therefore, the end parameter should be 5. Wait, if the function's end is inclusive, then the parameters would be start=2 and end=5. But if the function uses the same logic as Java's Arrays.copyOfRange, which is start inclusive and end exclusive, then to include index 5, the end should be 6. However, the user's question isn't clear on this. But since the user says \"from index 2 to index 5\", they probably mean the elements at positions 2, 3, 4, 5. So the subarray is from start=2 to end=5 (exclusive), which would be indices 2,3,4. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again. If the user wants indices 2,3,4,5, then the end should be 6 if the function is using the exclusive end. But the user might not know that. Since the function's parameters are described as \"starting index of the subarray\" and \"ending index of the subarray\", it's possible that the end is inclusive. But without more info, I should proceed with the user's explicit indices. The user says \"from index 2 to index 5\", so the subarray includes indices 2,3,4,5. Therefore, the start is 2 and end is 5. But I need to check the function's parameters. The function's parameters are start and end as Java integer type in string representation. So the user's input is start=2 and end=5. Therefore, the function call would be DurationImpl.alignSigns with buf as the array, start=2, end=5. But the user hasn't provided the actual array, but the array is named 'durations'. So the buf parameter should be the string representation of the array, like \"durations\". Wait, the parameters for buf are described as \"The array of BigDecimal elements... This is Java Array type parameter in string representation.\" So the buf is passed as a string, like the variable name. So the function call would be: DurationImpl.alignSigns(buf=\"durations\", start=\"2\", end=\"5\"). But the user hasn't provided the actual array, but the array is named 'durations'.

The system property in question is 'enableXmlSecurityFeature', and the feature is 'XML_SECURITY'. \n\nWait, the parameters are 'feature' and 'sysPropertyName'.

The provided function is TestObjectGraphAfterGC.doTesting. Let me look at its parameters. The required parameters are testcaseData, doGC, checker, gcLogName, shouldContain, and shouldNotContain.\n\nThe user provided the test case data file name, so I'll need to read that file's content as a string for testcaseData. The doGC parameter is a Runnable that triggers GC. Since the user mentioned a custom GC, maybe they have a specific method, but the example uses a string representation. The checker is a Consumer for verifying references, which the user refers to as referenceChecker. The gcLogName is given as 'gc-analysis.log'. The shouldContain list should include 'GC pause', and shouldNotContain should have 'OutOfMemoryError'.\n\nWait, the parameters for shouldContain and shouldNotContain are Java ArrayLists of strings. But in the function's parameters, they are described as strings. Wait, no, looking back: the parameters for shouldContain and shouldNotContain are of type string, but the description says they are ArrayLists. That might be a mistake in the function definition. But according to the given JSON, they are strings. However, the user's request specifies lists. Hmm, maybe the function expects them to be passed as comma-separated strings? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But the user's instruction says to use the parameters as per the function's definition. So I need to pass them as strings, perhaps in a format that the function can parse.\n\nAssuming that the function can handle lists as strings, maybe in JSON format. But the user's example might require passing them as comma-separated. However, the exact format isn't clear. But given the function's parameters, I'll proceed as per the given structure.\n\nSo, testcaseData would be the content of 'humongous-test-case.json' as a string. The doGC is a Runnable, but the user says to execute a custom GC. Maybe the doGC parameter is a string representation of a method or command. Similarly, the checker is the referenceChecker function as a string. The gcLogName is 'gc-analysis.log'. shouldContain is a list with 'GC pause', and shouldNotContain is a list with 'OutOfMemoryError'.\n\nBut the parameters for shouldContain and shouldNotContain are described as strings, not lists. So perhaps they should be passed as comma-separated strings. For example, shouldContain=\"GC pause\" and shouldNotContain=\"OutOfMemoryError\". Or maybe as JSON arrays. But the function's parameters are defined as strings, so I'll have to pass them as such. However, the user's question says \"ensure it contains 'GC pause' but does not contain 'OutOfMemoryError'\", so the lists are ['GC pause'] and ['OutOfMemoryError'].\n\nBut the function's parameters for these are strings. Maybe the function expects them to be passed as strings in a specific format. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll assume that the parameters should be passed as strings, perhaps in a format that the function can process. For example, shouldContain is a string like \"['GC pause']\" and shouldNotContain is \"['OutOfMemoryError']\".\n\nPutting it all together, the function call would include all required parameters. The user hasn't provided the actual content of the test case data, so I'll need to read the JSON file.

The parameters required are `args` and `out`.\n\nThe user mentioned using the arguments array `testArgs` and logging to `System.out`. So, `args` should be `testArgs`, and `out` should be `System.out`. The function requires these two parameters, and they are both provided in the question. I need to format the function call correctly. The `args` is a string array, so in Java syntax, it would be something like `[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]`, but the user specified `testArgs`, so maybe it's passed as a variable. However, since the function expects a string representation, I should use the actual array. Wait, the parameters description says `args` is a string array in Java Array type parameter in string representation. So I need to represent the array as a string, like `\"testArgs\"`. Wait, no, the user is passing the array `testArgs` as the argument. But how is it represented? If `testArgs` is a Java array, then in the function's parameters, it's a string that represents the array. So maybe the user should pass it as a string like `\"testArgs\"`, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the user is passing the actual array elements, but the question says \"using the arguments array `testArgs`\", so perhaps the `args` parameter should be set to `testArgs` as a string. Wait, the parameters for `args` are described as \"An array of strings representing the arguments for the test. This is Java Array type parameter in string representation. The list elements are of type String; they are not in string representation.\" So the `args` parameter is a string that represents a Java array.

But since the user is using `testArgs` as the array, maybe the function call should have `args=testArgs`? Wait, but in the function's parameters, the `args` is a string. So perhaps the user needs to pass the array as a string, like `\"testArgs\"`, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to pass the array elements as a string, like `[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]`.

The available function is thrcputime002.runIt, which takes argv and out parameters.\n\nFirst, the argv needs to be an array of command-line arguments. The parameters required are -waitTime and -iterations. The wait time is 2 minutes, which I should convert to seconds since the function might expect seconds. Wait, but the user said 2 minutes, so that's 120 seconds. But maybe the function expects minutes as a unit? The description isn't clear. Hmm, but the user specified \"wait time of 2 minutes\", so maybe the function expects the value in minutes. Wait, but in Java, command-line arguments are usually in seconds for such tests. Wait, but the user might have specified minutes. Let me check the function's parameters again. The description says \"wait time and number of iterations\" but doesn't specify units. However, the user explicitly says 2 minutes, so I should use 2 as the value for -waitTime. Wait, but maybe the function expects seconds. This is a bit ambiguous. However, since the user says 2 minutes, I'll go with 2 as the value. Alternatively, maybe the function uses minutes. But without more info, I'll proceed with the user's exact wording. So, -waitTime 2 and -iterations 500.\n\nNext, the out parameter is the PrintStream. The user wants output to System.out, so the out parameter should be \"System.out\".\n\nPutting it all together, the argv should be an array with \"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\". But the function's argv is a string representing a Java array. So in Java, that would be something like new String[] {\"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\"}. But since the parameter is a string, I need to represent it as a Java array string. So the argv parameter would be \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" but in Java array syntax. Wait, the description says the argv is a Java Array type parameter in string representation. So the correct format would be a string that represents the array, like \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" but in Java's array format. Wait, in Java, when you pass an array as a string, it's usually represented as a comma-separated list within parentheses. But the exact format might depend on how the function is expecting it. However, the user's example might have the parameters as a string array. So perhaps the argv should be a string like \"-waitTime 2 -iterations 500\" but split into elements. Wait, the parameters are in the format of \"-waitTime, <waitTime>, -iterations, <iterations>\". So each parameter is a separate element. So the array would be [\"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\"]. So in Java, that would be represented as a string like \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" but with the array syntax. However, the exact string representation might be important. For example, in Java, if you have an array of strings, you might pass it as a string like \"[\\\"-waitTime\\\", \\\"2\\\", \\\"iterations\\\", \\\"500\\\"]\", but the function's parameter is a string. But the user's function's parameters say that argv is a string representing the Java array. So perhaps the correct way is to format it as a Java array string. So the argv parameter would be \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" but in the format of a Java array. Wait, but the user's function's parameters say that the argv is a Java array type parameter in string representation. So the actual value would be something like \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" but in the format of a Java array. For example, if the function expects a String array, then the string representation would be the elements separated by commas. But I'm not entirely sure. However, the user's example might have the parameters as a string array. So I'll proceed with the parameters as \"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\" as the array elements. So the argv parameter would be a string like \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\".\n\nThe out parameter is \"System.out\".\n\nSo the function call would be thrcputime002.runIt with argv as [\"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\"] and out as \"System.out\".\n\nBut since the function's parameters are in Java 8 SDK syntax, the out parameter can be any Java object in string representation. So \"System.out\" is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct function call is thrcputime002.runIt with the parameters argv as \"-waitTime, 2, -iterations, 500\" (as a Java array string) and out as \"System.out\".\n</think>\n\n[thrcputime002.runIt(argv=[\"-waitTime\", \"2\", \"-iterations\", \"500\"], out=\"System.out\")]", "input_token_count": 488, "output_token_count": 1119, "latency": 35.34570574760437}

The original and new values might be part of the test case that the function is checking, but the function itself doesn't take those as parameters. Therefore, the correct function call is to pass the argv and out as specified. The user might need to ensure that the test logic within runIt uses those values, but the function call itself doesn't require them. \n\nSo the answer is to call classfloadhk005.runIt with argv as the array string and out as logStream. The user might need to format the argv correctly as a Java array string. If the user provided the argv as a Python list, converting it to a Java array string would be necessary. But the user's input shows the argv as a Python list, so maybe they need to pass it as a string in Java syntax. However, the function's parameters expect the argv as a string representing the array. So the correct call would be to pass the argv as a string like \"['/path/to/classes', '60']\" but in Java's array format. But the user might have already handled that. \n\nIn any case, based on the given parameters, the function call should be made with the provided argv and out.

The suspendPolicy needs to be a string representing the Java integer type. EVENT_THREAD is likely the correct value here. The property should be a string, and the user provided 'testProperty' with the value 'deathEvent001'. \n\nWait, the parameters are suspendPolicy and property. The user's property is 'testProperty' set to 'deathEvent001', but the function's property parameter is a single string.

Or perhaps the function expects the property name and value as separate parameters, but the function's parameters only have 'property' as a single parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the function's 'property' parameter is the name, and the value is handled elsewhere. But the user's question says \"a property 'testProperty' set to 'deathEvent001'\", which implies that the property name is 'testProperty' and the value is 'deathEvent001'. However, the function's parameters only have 'property' as a single string. This might be a problem. Wait, maybe the function's 'property' parameter is the entire property string, so the user should pass \"testProperty=deathEvent001\" as the property value. Alternatively, perhaps the function expects the property name and value as separate parameters, but the function's parameters don't have that. Wait, looking back at the function's parameters: the 'property' is a string. So maybe the user needs to pass the property as a single string. But the user's instruction is to set the property 'testProperty' to 'deathEvent001', which would be a key-value pair. However, the function's parameters don't have a way to specify both. This might be an issue. Wait, maybe the function's 'property' parameter is the name, and the value is set elsewhere, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the function's 'property' parameter is a string that includes both the name and value. For example, \"testProperty=deathEvent001\". \n\nAssuming that the function expects the property as a single string, perhaps in the format \"name=value\", then the user's request would require passing \"testProperty=deathEvent001\" as the property parameter. However, the user's question states \"a property 'testProperty' set to 'deathEvent001'\", which might mean that the property name is 'testProperty' and the value is 'deathEvent001'. But given the function's parameters, maybe the 'property' parameter is the name, and the value is handled by another parameter, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function's 'property' parameter is the value, and the name is something else.

The thread parameter expects a ThreadReference, which the user provided as mainThread. The testedClass is the class name, which is given. The suspendPolicy is an integer in string form, so EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL should be converted to its integer value as a string. Wait, the description says suspendPolicy is a Java integer type parameter in string representation. So if SUSPEND_ALL is an integer constant, like 1, then it should be passed as \"1\".

But according to the function's parameters, suspendPolicy is a string that represents an integer. So maybe the user's input is incorrect, but I should use the value as given. Wait, no. The function's suspendPolicy is described as a Java integer type parameter in string representation. So the actual value should be the integer as a string. For example, if the suspend policy is SUSPEND_ALL, which is an integer constant (like 1), then the parameter should be \"1\". However, the user wrote \"EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\", which is a string. But perhaps in the JDI environment, the suspend policy is specified as an integer, so the user might have intended to use the integer value. But the user's input says \"suspend policy of EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\", which is a string. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, the function's parameters for suspendPolicy is a string that represents an integer. So the user's input of \"EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\" is a string, but the function expects the integer value as a string. So maybe the user made a mistake here. However, since the user provided that value, perhaps they intended to use the string as is. But according to the function's description, it's supposed to be the integer in string form. So maybe the correct value is the integer value of SUSPEND_ALL. For example, in JDI, EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL is 1. So the parameter should be \"1\". But the user wrote \"EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\" as the value. \n\nBut the user's question says \"suspend policy of EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\", so maybe they are using the constant name. However, the function requires the integer value as a string. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. But since the user provided that value, perhaps they expect it to be passed as is. However, the function's parameters specify that it's a Java integer type in string representation. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the integer value. But since the user provided the constant name, maybe they need to convert it. However, without knowing the exact integer value, perhaps the user intended to use the string as is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's parameter is expecting the string representation of the integer, so if the suspend policy is SUSPEND_ALL, which is an integer, then the parameter should be the string of that integer. For example, if SUSPEND_ALL is 1, then the parameter is \"1\". \n\nBut the user's input is \"EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\", which is a string. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. However, since the function requires the integer as a string, I need to adjust that. But since the user hasn't provided the integer value, maybe I should use the string as given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's parameter is expecting the string name of the suspend policy, like \"SUSPEND_ALL\". But the description says it's a Java integer type parameter in string representation. So that's conflicting. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's parameters, the suspendPolicy is a string that represents an integer. Therefore, the user's input of \"EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL\" is not in the correct format. But since the user provided that, perhaps they intended to use the string as is. However, the function may not accept that. \n\nBut the user's question is to create the MethodEntryRequest with that suspend policy. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the value as provided by the user, even if it's not in the correct format. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function's parameter is expecting the string representation of the integer, so the user should provide the integer value.

Let me check the parameters again. The argv is an array of strings, with elements like \"-waitTime\", \"<waitTime>\", etc. So the actual value for waitTime is a string. The user says set wait time to 2 minutes. But the function's parameter description doesn't specify units. Maybe the user expects to pass \"2\" as the wait time, assuming minutes.

The 'symbol' is required, and the user is specifically asking about 'getVersion'. \n\nSo, the function call should include the symbol 'getVersion'. The 'recursive' parameter is optional and defaults to null, so I don't need to specify it unless the user mentions something about recursion. Since the question doesn't mention that, I can omit it. \n\nTherefore, the correct function call is NFILibrary.isMemberReadable with the symbol parameter set to 'getVersion'. That should answer the user's question.\n</think>\n\n[NFILibrary.isMemberReadable(symbol='getVersion')]", "input_token_count": 402, "output_token_count": 206, "latency": 6.663366794586182}

They mentioned using a specialized node called `InlinableNodeInstance` and binding it to the `NodeLibraryInstance`. The receiver is `ExportInlinedObject1Instance`.\n\nLooking at the available function, it's `ExportNodeTest.doGeneric`. The parameters required are receiver, argument, node, and library. All of these are provided in the question. The receiver is `ExportInlinedObject1Instance`, the argument is 'HelloWorld', the node is `InlinableNodeInstance`, and the library is `NodeLibraryInstance`. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires all four, and they're all there. So the correct call should be to use `ExportNodeTest.doGeneric` with those parameters. No missing info, so the function call should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\n[ExportNodeTest.doGeneric(receiver=\"ExportInlinedObject1Instance\", argument=\"HelloWorld\", node=\"InlinableNodeInstance\", library=\"NodeLibraryInstance\")]", "input_token_count": 523, "output_token_count": 229, "latency": 7.366530656814575}
{"id": "java_96", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to generate a CodeTree for a call conversion using the Truffle DSL processor. They mentioned a non-static method called 'convertValue' that needs a frame parameter 'frameVar' and a return value 'returnValueCode'.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The provided function is InstrumentableProcessor.createCallConverter. The parameters required are converterMethod, frameParameterName, and returnName. \n\nThe converterMethod should be the ExecutableElement for the method. Since the user specified a non-static method named 'convertValue', I'll use that as the converterMethod. The frameParameterName is given as 'frameVar', and the returnName is 'returnValueCode'. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are included. The function requires all three, and the user provided all necessary info. So, I can call the function with these parameters. The parameters are in string representation as per the function's description. \n\nSo the correct call should be createCallConverter with converterMethod='convertValue', frameParameterName='frameVar', returnName='returnValueCode'.\n</think>\n\n[InstrumentableProcessor.createCallConverter(converterMethod='convertValue', frameParameterName='frameVar', returnName='returnValueCode')]", "input_token_count": 484, "output_token_count": 257, "latency": 8.202172994613647}
{"id": "java_97", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to generate introspection information for a class called NodeClass using the FlatNodeGenFactory.generateIntrospectionInfo function. They also specified that the introspection should not be inlined.\n\nFirst, I need to check the function's parameters. The required parameters are 'clazz' and 'inlined'. The 'clazz' is the class name as a string, which here is NodeClass. The 'inlined' parameter is a Java boolean in string form. Since the user said \"not inlined\", that means inlined should be false.\n\nSo, converting that to the function's required format, inlined would be \"false\". The clazz is \"NodeClass\". Both parameters are required, so I need to include them. The function call should be generateIntrospectionInfo with those values. I should make sure the syntax is correct, using the parameter names and values as specified. No other functions are needed here.

{"id": "java_98", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the probability of a loop condition being true based on 150 true evaluations and 50 false ones. I need to use the provided function for this.\n\nFirst, check the function parameters. The function LoopConditionProfile.calculateProbability requires trueCountLocal and falseCountLocal as strings. The true count here is 150, and false is 50. Wait, the parameters mention Java long and integer types, but they're passed as strings. So I should convert those numbers to strings.\n\nSo the trueCountLocal would be \"150\" and falseCountLocal as \"50\". The function should calculate the probability by dividing true count by the total (150 + 50 = 200). So 150/200 = 0.75. But the function's actual calculation isn't specified, but the user just needs the correct parameters passed.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted as strings. The user provided the counts, so no missing parameters. Therefore, the correct function call is with those values.\n</think>\n\n[LoopConditionProfile.calculateProbability(trueCountLocal=\"150\", falseCountLocal=\"50\")]", "input_token_count": 414, "output_token_count": 258, "latency": 8.266652345657349}
{"id": "java_99", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a delegate library instance for their custom library type MyCustomLibrary. They mentioned using a factory object myFactory and an existing delegate instance existingDelegate that's not adoptable. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. The only function provided is LibraryExport.createDelegate, which takes factory and delegate as parameters. The description says it creates a delegate library instance, and if the delegate isn't adoptable, it forces adoption. That matches the user's scenario since their existingDelegate isn't adoptable.\n\nSo, the parameters required are factory and delegate. The user provided both myFactory and existingDelegate. Even though the delegate isn't adoptable, the function handles that by forcing adoption. Therefore, I should call LibraryExport.createDelegate with those parameters.
