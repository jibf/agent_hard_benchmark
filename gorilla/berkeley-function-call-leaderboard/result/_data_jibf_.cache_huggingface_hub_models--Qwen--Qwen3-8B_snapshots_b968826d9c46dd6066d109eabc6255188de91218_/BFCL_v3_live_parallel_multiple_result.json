The location is specified as 'Seoul, South Korea', which is in the enum, so that's good. The units should be 'metric' for Celsius. The api_key has a default, so even if it's not provided, it should work. So I'll call that function with those parameters.\n\nNext, they want to turn on the air conditioner in the living room. The ControlAppliance.execute function is for controlling appliances. The command needs to be in Korean, specifying the room, appliance, and action. The example given is '\uac70\uc2e4, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8, \uc2e4\ud589' which translates to \"Living room, AC, execute\". That fits the requirement.

Paris, France is a city in a country, so 'Paris, France' should work. Letterkenny, Ireland is a city in Ireland, so 'Letterkenny, IE' since the state abbreviation for Ireland is IE. \n\nFor the first request, Paris, France, the user specified English, which is the default language, so no need to set it unless required.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory might be the same as the repo name. So I'll use directory_name='nodejs-welcome' here. This will determine the predominant language, which is needed for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\nThen, step 2.1: create a Dockerfile based on the analysis. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Using the same directory name as before. But wait, the analysis might have found the language, say Node.js. The Dockerfile creation might need that info, but the function parameters don't include language. Maybe the function uses the directory name to generate the Dockerfile, assuming the language from the analysis. So I'll call create_a_docker_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nFor 2.2, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, etc. The analysis might have given the language, which could influence the image name. But the function's parameters don't take language. The user might expect default values. So I'll use the directory name as the deployment name, image name as 'nodejs-welcome' with latest tag. Replicas default to 1, port 80, service type ClusterIP. So call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nThen step 3: add all changed files to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, etc. The user didn't specify a commit message, so default is 'Update changes'. Branch is default 'main'. So call push_git_changes_to_github with directory_name='nodejs-welcome'.\n\nWait, but after cloning, the directory might be named 'nodejs-welcome' by default. So all the functions should use that directory name. Let me check each function's parameters again. The clone_repo's destination is default '.', so the repo is cloned into the current directory, and the directory name would be the repo's name. So yes, using 'nodejs-welcome' as directory_name for all subsequent steps.\n\nI need to make sure that each function is called with the correct parameters. The analyse_repo_contents is called first to get the language, but the functions don't have a parameter for the language. Wait, the functions are separate. The analyse_repo_contents is called to determine the language, but the other functions (create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML) don't take the language as a parameter. So maybe the Dockerfile creation uses the directory name to infer the project name, and the Kubernetes YAML uses the same. The user might expect that the Dockerfile is created based on the analysis, but the function doesn't have a parameter for the language. So perhaps the function is designed to create a Dockerfile regardless, but the analysis is just part of the process. Maybe the analysis is to determine if there's a Dockerfile already, but the user says to create/update it. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes, commit and push.\n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git')\n2. analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n3. create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n4. create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n5. push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')\n\nWait, but the user says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which is step 3. The push_git_changes_to_github function does that. But the user might need to first add the files. However, the push function automatically adds changes. So the steps are correct.\n\nSo the final answer is the list of function calls in order.\n</think>\n\n[clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git'), analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome'), push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome')]", "input_token_count": 1242, "output_token_count": 1010, "latency": 33.70379424095154}

The parameters needed are the prompt, include_after_year, and source. The user specified to include only 2022 onwards, so include_after_year should be True. The prompt is exactly what they provided: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. Wait, the exact verbatim is important here. So I'll set the prompt to that string. The source isn't specified, so default to Google.\n\nNext, the image request. They want a digital painting of a masked woman with peacock feathers, in a cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha style. The generate_image function can create digital images. The prompt should be the detailed description they gave. Resolution and color mode aren't specified, so use defaults. But wait, the generate_human_image function is more specific for human subjects.

The generate_image function has a prompt parameter that can take the detailed description. The resolution and color mode can be adjusted. However, the user mentioned \"digital painting\" which might require higher quality. Let me use generate_image with the given prompt, set resolution to a higher value like 3840x2160, color mode RGB, and image quality 100. Alternatively, maybe generate_human_image is better since it's a human subject. The prompt for generate_human_image would be \"a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style.\" But the function's description says it's for human demographics. Since the user wants a painting style, maybe generate_image is more appropriate. I'll go with generate_image, using the detailed prompt, high resolution, RGB, and max quality.

The user wants to find out when Shishir's birthday is from previous conversations and then send a congratulatory message.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a function that can search through prior conversation history. Looking at the available functions, there's 'recall_memory_search' which searches the conversation history for a query. That seems right. The parameters required are 'query', 'page', and 'request_heartbeat'. The query here would be \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nSo, I'll call recall_memory_search with query=\"Shishir's birthday\" to find the information. If the search returns the date, then I can proceed. But if not, maybe I need to handle that, but the user hasn't mentioned handling errors here.\n\nAssuming the search works, once I get the date, the next step is to send a 'Happy Birthday!' message to Shishir. For sending messages, the 'send_message' function is available. The parameters needed are 'message' and 'recipient'. The recipient would be Shishir's identifier, which might be his username or email. However, the user hasn't provided the specific recipient details. Wait, the 'send_message' function has a default recipient of 'default@example.com'. But the user might expect to send it to Shishir directly. Since the user hasn't specified the recipient, maybe I should use the default, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the previous conversations already have Shishir's contact info stored in memory. \n\nWait, the 'recall_memory_search' might also retrieve the recipient info if it was mentioned. But the user's question is to send the message regardless, so maybe the recipient is known. However, since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the function call should use the default, but that's a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the 'send_message' function's recipient parameter is required, but the default is provided. The required parameters for send_message are 'message', and 'recipient' is optional with a default. So, the user's instruction says \"send a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\", so perhaps the recipient is known, but since it's not provided, maybe the function will use the default. However, that might not be correct. But given the information, I have to proceed with the available data. \n\nSo, first, call recall_memory_search to find Shishir's birthday. Then, use send_message with the message \"Happy Birthday!\" and the recipient as Shishir's identifier. But since the recipient isn't specified, maybe the default is used. However, the user might expect that the recipient is known from previous interactions. But since the function's default is 'default@example.com', perhaps that's the best we can do unless the search returns the recipient info. \n\nWait, the user's question is to send the message regardless, so maybe the recipient is already known. But without that info, the function call would need to have the recipient. Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the function call will use the default. But that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the 'send_message' function's recipient is determined by the context, but in the absence of that, the default is used. \n\nSo, the steps are: first, search for Shishir's birthday using recall_memory_search, then send the message using send_message with the message content and the recipient. But since the recipient isn't specified, perhaps the function call will use the default. However, the user might have intended to send it to Shishir's known contact, but without that info, we can't proceed. \n\nWait, the user's question says \"send a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless\". The 'regardless' part might imply that the recipient is known, but the user hasn't provided it. So, maybe the function call will use the default, but that's not ideal. However, given the available functions and parameters, that's the only way. \n\nSo, the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, send_message with message \"Happy Birthday!\" and recipient as the default. But the user might have intended to send it to Shishir's contact, but since it's not provided, we proceed with the default. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'send_message' function's recipient is determined by the context, but in the absence of that, the default is used. So, the answer would be two function calls: first search, then send.\n</think>\n\n[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"Shishir\", urgent=True)]", "input_token_count": 1870, "output_token_count": 967, "latency": 32.550121545791626}

The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. They need two things: relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories, and the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nFirst, I should check the available functions. The 'get_relevant_classes' function can search for classes related to 'CellResult' with include_subdirectories set to true. That should help find any related classes in subdirectories.\n\nNext, the user wants the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function requires class_name and method_name. So I'll need to call this function twice, once for each method. But wait, the user mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides those methods. So the methods might be present in the superclass. However, the error is about 'getNumericValue()' in 'CellResult', which might be a different class. But the user's main request is about the signatures of the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nWait, the user is getting an error that 'getNumericValue()' isn't found in 'CellResult'. Maybe the methods they're overriding in 'AbstractCellHandler' are expecting 'getNumericValue()' from 'CellResult', but it's not there. But the user's immediate request is about finding related classes to 'CellResult' and the method signatures in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo, first, call get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult' and include_subdirectories true. Then, call get_signature for 'AbstractCellHandler' with 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' methods. But the user might need to check if those methods exist in 'AbstractCellHandler' and their parameters. Also, the error might be due to a missing method in 'CellResult', but the user's question is about the two methods in 'AbstractCellHandler'.\n\nSo the function calls needed are:\n\n1. get_relevant_classes with search_string 'CellResult', case_sensitive false (default), include_subdirectories true.\n2. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'setCellValue'.\n3. get_signature for class 'AbstractCellHandler' and method 'getCellValue'.\n\nThat should cover both parts of the user's request. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. For get_relevant_classes, the required parameter is search_string, which is provided. For get_signature, class_name and method_name are required. The user mentioned the methods are in 'AbstractCellHandler', so those are the parameters. The include_private parameter is optional with default false, which is fine unless the methods are private, but the user is overriding them, so they should be public. So no need to set include_private here.\n\nSo the three function calls should be made.\n</think>\n\n[get_relevant_classes(search_string=\"CellResult\", include_subdirectories=True), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"setCellValue\"), get_signature(class_name=\"AbstractCellHandler\", method_name=\"getCellValue\")]", "input_token_count": 1074, "output_token_count": 656, "latency": 21.555692434310913}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method called get_weather(String) in the Weather class. They want to know the available methods and properties of the Weather class and the signature of the get_weather method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The available functions are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user is asking about the methods and properties of the Weather class, so get_class_info seems appropriate here. That function retrieves info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. The parameters needed are class_name and optionally module_name. Since the user didn't specify a module, I'll assume it's the current module, so module_name can be omitted or set to default.\n\nNext, they want the signature of the get_weather method in the same class. For that, the get_signature function is the right choice. It requires class_name and method_name. The user mentioned the method name is get_weather, so I'll use that. The include_private parameter is optional, defaulting to False, which is fine unless private methods are needed, but the user didn't specify that.\n\nWait, but the user's error is about a String parameter. Maybe the method expects a different type, like a Location or something else. But the user is asking for the available methods, so checking the class info would show all methods, including their parameters. So using get_class_info first would list all methods, and then if get_weather exists, get_signature would retrieve its parameters.\n\nSo the steps are: first call get_class_info for the Weather class to get all methods and properties. Then, if get_weather exists, call get_signature with the class and method names. But since the user wants both the available methods and the method's signature if it exists, I need to make both function calls.\n\nI should check if the parameters are provided. The class_name is given as 'Weather', so that's covered. The module_name is optional, so I can leave it out. For get_signature, the method_name is 'get_weather'. \n\nSo the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_class_info(class_name='Weather')\n2. get_signature(class_name='Weather', method_name='get_weather')\n\nThat should retrieve the necessary information to resolve the compilation error.\n</think>\n\n[get_class_info(class_name='Weather'), get_signature(class_name='Weather', method_name='get_weather')]", "input_token_count": 998, "output_token_count": 509, "latency": 16.59773898124695}
{"id": "live_parallel_multiple_13-11-0", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle the user's question step by step. First, they want the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48. I remember that HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD). Looking at the available functions, there's a math_gcd function that takes two integers, a and b. The parameters require a and b to be non-negative integers. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative, I can use this function. The first part is straightforward.\n\nNext, the user asks about the steepness of the curve for f(x) = x\u00b2 at x = 5. Steepness relates to the slope of the tangent at that point, which is the derivative. The available function is estimate_derivative, which needs the function, x value, and optional dx and method. The function f(x) is x squared, so I'll need to represent that as a callable. In Python, I can use a lambda function like lambda x: x**2. The x value is 5. The default dx is 0.0001 and method is central. Since the user didn't specify dx or method, I'll use defaults. So, I'll call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5.\n\nWait, but how does the function handle the mathematical function? The parameters say the function is a callable object. So passing the lambda should work. I need to make sure the parameters are correctly formatted. The first function call is math_gcd(a=36, b=48). Then, the second is estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5). That should cover both parts of the question.\n</think>\n\n[math_gcd(a=36, b=48), estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5)]", "input_token_count": 621, "output_token_count": 389, "latency": 13.089556455612183}

I remember there's a math_gcd function for that. The parameters required are a and b, both integers. Since 36 is smaller than 48, maybe the function expects a to be the larger one? Wait, the description says a is the first and larger positive integer. Oh, right, so I need to make sure a is larger than b. So I should pass a=48 and b=36. That should compute the GCD correctly.\n\nNext part is estimating the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The function available is estimate_derivative. The parameters needed are function, x, dx, and method. The function is a callable, so I need to represent x\u00b2 as a lambda. In Python, that would be lambda x: x**2. The x-value is 5. The default dx is 0.001, and the method defaults to 'central'. Since the user didn't specify dx or method, I can use the defaults. So the parameters would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. \n\nWait, the parameters for estimate_derivative are function and x, with dx and method as optional. So the call should include function and x, and maybe dx and method if specified. Since the user didn't mention them, I'll use the defaults. So the second function call is estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5). \n\nLet me double-check the parameters. For math_gcd, a and b are required. The user provided 36 and 48, but since a should be the larger, I need to swap them. So math_gcd(a=48, b=36). Then the derivative function is correct. I think that's all. No missing parameters here.

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the weather in Queenstown, Singapore. The function get_current_weather requires a location. The user mentioned \"Queenstown Singapore,\" but I should check if that's a valid location. Wait, Queenstown is a city in New Zealand, but the user might be referring to Queenstown in Singapore? Or maybe it's a typo. However, I should take the user's input as given. The location parameter can be in the format \"City, Country\" or \"City, State (abbr)\".

The unit is optional with a default of fahrenheit, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default. \n\nWait, but does Singapore have a state abbreviation?

So partner.mandates might not be the right choice here. Unless the user is a partner, but the question doesn't specify that. So probably, user.mandates is the correct function.\n\nSo for each user (Parath and Bhanu), I need to get their mandates with status active and pending. Since the function's status parameter can only take one value at a time, I'll have to make separate calls for each status. \n\nWait, the user.mandates function's status has an enum of active, pending, inactive, and the default is active. So for each user, I need to call the function twice: once with status 'active' and once with 'pending'. \n\nSo total of 2 users * 2 statuses = 4 function calls. \n\nLet me check if the parameters are correct. The name is required, so for each user, the name parameter is set to 'parath' and 'bhanu' respectively. The status is set to 'active' and 'pending' in separate calls.\n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\nuser.mandates(name='parath', status='active')\nuser.mandates(name='parath', status='pending')\nuser.mandates(name='bhanu', status='active')\nuser.mandates(name='bhanu', status='pending')\n\nThat should cover all the required mandates for both users with the specified statuses.\n</think>\n\n[user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"active\"), user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"pending\"), user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"active\"), user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"pending\")]", "input_token_count": 518, "output_token_count": 508, "latency": 16.748144388198853}
