The propertyDetails require propertyID and ownerID. The rentalManagement needs leaseTracking with leaseID, tenantID, leaseStart, and leaseEnd. MaintenanceScheduling needs maintenanceTasks with taskID, description, scheduledDate, and contractor details. \n\nThe user's message is a request for help but doesn't include any of these specific parameters. They might not have provided the required information yet. So, according to the guidelines, if the necessary parameters are missing, I should ask for them. \n\nThe required parameters for RealEstateManager_manageProperty are propertyDetails, rentalManagement, and maintenanceScheduling. Since the user hasn't given any of these, I need to identify which ones are missing. The propertyDetails require propertyID and ownerID, so those are missing. The rentalManagement and maintenanceScheduling sections also need various parameters that aren't provided. \n\nThe correct approach here is to inform the user that the necessary parameters are missing. The output should be in the format [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"]. But since there are multiple missing parameters across different sections, I need to list them all. However, the example in the instructions shows listing the missing parameters for a specific API. \n\nWait, the RealEstateManager_manageProperty's required parameters are propertyDetails, rentalManagement, and maintenanceScheduling. Each of these has their own required fields. So the missing parameters are propertyID, ownerID (from propertyDetails), and the entire rentalManagement and maintenanceScheduling objects. But the user hasn't provided any of these. \n\nSo the correct output would be to point out that the necessary parameters are missing. The user hasn't provided propertyID, ownerID, rentalManagement, or maintenanceScheduling. Therefore, the response should be [\"Missing necessary parameters (propertyDetails, rentalManagement, maintenanceScheduling) for the api RealEstateManager_manageProperty\"]. \n\nBut looking at the API's required parameters, the top-level required are propertyDetails, rentalManagement, and maintenanceScheduling. So those are the ones missing. The user hasn't provided any of those, so the message should list those three as missing. The output format is [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"]. \n\nYes, that's correct.

The time_period is needed with start and end dates. The user mentioned \"recent years,\" but that's vague. The API requires specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. Since the user didn't provide exact dates, I need to ask for them. Also, the analysis_details include focus_area and methods. The focus_area can be either International Relations or Conflict Resolution. The user's query is about diplomatic strategies in general, so maybe both areas are relevant.

The PolicyImpactSimulator_simulate seems relevant because it simulates the impact of policy changes on event attendance and satisfaction. The other API, PolicyImpactAnalyzer_predictImpact, is more about political decisions and societal aspects like economic and social changes. Since the user is focused on a concert event, the simulator is probably the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters for PolicyImpactSimulator_simulate: policyChanges (array of policyName and effect), historicalData (array of strings), and simulationPeriod (from and to dates). \n\nThe user mentioned \"changes in ticket pricing policy\" but didn't specify if it's a positive, negative, or neutral effect.

The simulation period is the summer months, but the specific dates aren't given. \n\nWait, the user said \"upcoming concert during the summer months\". So the simulation period would be from the start to the end of the summer months. But which dates exactly? The user hasn't specified the exact dates, so that's missing. Also, the historical data needs to be provided as an array of strings, but the user hasn't listed the specific data points. \n\nAdditionally, the policyChanges require the policyName and effect. The policyName here is \"ticket pricing policy change\", but the effect (positive, negative, neutral) isn't specified. The user might be considering a price increase (negative effect on attendance but positive on revenue?) or a decrease. So the effect depends on the direction of the change. Since the user hasn't specified, I need to ask for that.\n\nSo the missing parameters are: effect in policyChanges, historicalData details, and the exact simulationPeriod dates. \n\nBut according to the API's required parameters, all three are required. Since the user hasn't provided the effect, historical data specifics, or the exact dates, I need to ask for those. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"using previous event data\" but didn't list what data.

The greeningOptions need tree planting species options, planting density, vertical garden wall criteria (sun exposure and material), and irrigation type.\n\nThe user hasn't provided any of these specific details yet. They just gave a general request. So, the assistant needs to figure out which parameters are missing. For streetDetails, length and width are required numbers, and existingTrees is an array of species and age. For greeningOptions, treePlanting's speciesOptions is an array of strings, plantingDensity a number. VerticalGardens requires wallCriteria with sunExposure (number) and material (string), and irrigation from an enum.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided any of these, the assistant can't proceed without more information. The next step is to ask for the missing parameters. According to the guidelines, if the user's instructions lack key details, the output should be [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"]. The required parameters for the API are streetDetails and greeningOptions. But within those, there are sub-parameters that are required.

But those are objects that contain their own required fields. So technically, the user hasn't provided any of the nested parameters. Therefore, the missing parameters would be all the required ones inside streetDetails and greeningOptions. But how to list them? The API's required parameters are streetDetails and greeningOptions, but those objects have their own required properties. So the assistant needs to point out that the necessary parameters within those objects are missing.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the output should be [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"], replacing key1, key2 with the names of the missing parameters. However, since streetDetails and greeningOptions are objects, their required properties are part of their structure. So the missing parameters would be the individual fields within those objects. For example, streetDetails requires length, width, existingTrees. GreeningOptions requires treePlanting and verticalGardens, which in turn require their own parameters.\n\nThis is getting complicated. The user hasn't provided any of the necessary details. The assistant needs to list all the required parameters that are missing. But the API's required parameters are streetDetails and greeningOptions, which are objects. However, without the inner parameters, those objects can't be properly formed. Therefore, the correct approach is to list all the required inner parameters as missing. But how to represent that? The problem might expect the assistant to list the top-level required parameters (streetDetails and greeningOptions) as missing, but since they are objects, maybe the actual missing parameters are their sub-properties. However, the user hasn't provided any of them, so the assistant should list all the required sub-parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should just point out that the top-level parameters (streetDetails and greeningOptions) are missing, as they are required.

The required fields are jobRole, evaluationMetrics, and assessmentPeriod. The user provided the jobRole as \"Software Developer,\" which is in the enum list. But they didn't specify the evaluationMetrics or assessmentPeriod. \n\nThe evaluationMetrics is an array of objects with metricName and importanceLevel. The user hasn't given any details on what metrics they want to assess, like coding skills, problem-solving, etc., or their importance levels. Also, the assessmentPeriod needs to be one of the enum values: Last 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year. The user hasn't specified the time frame.\n\nSince these are required parameters and they're missing, I need to ask the user for more information. The technicalFields are optional but might be relevant. For software developers, \"Software Development\" is a possible field, but the user didn't mention it. However, since it's optional, maybe I can proceed without it, but the main issue is the missing required parameters.\n\nSo, the correct approach here is to inform the user that the necessary parameters evaluationMetrics and assessmentPeriod are missing.

EventDetails needs eventName, eventType, and eventDate. The eventType has to be one of the enum values, which in this case should be 'gallery opening'. The eventDate is specified as August, but the user hasn't given an exact date. The parameter requires a date in string format. So I'm missing the specific date here. Also, mediaContacts are required, but the user hasn't provided any contact information yet. \n\nSo the necessary parameters that are missing are eventDate under eventDetails and mediaContacts. The user mentioned August but not the exact date, so that's incomplete. I should prompt them to provide the exact event date and the list of media contacts. Without these, the API can't be called.

The required fields are patient_id and data_type. The user hasn't provided specific data entries yet, so that's missing. Then, encryption_standards needs an algorithm (which is AES here) and key_length. The algorithm is specified, but key_length is optional but required? Wait, looking at the parameters: encryption_standards has required ['algorithm'], so key_length is optional. But the user didn't mention key_length. So maybe we can proceed without it, but the API might need it. Wait, the API's encryption_standards has 'algorithm' as required, and key_length is not required. So maybe it's okay to omit key_length. But the user hasn't provided data_entries at all. So the missing parameters are data_entries. Therefore, the response should be asking for the missing data_entries.

The message isn't explicitly stated, but the alert is about the thunderstorm, so the message would likely be something like \"Impending thunderstorm alert...\" Target areas are downtown and northern areas. Broadcast time isn't specified, so maybe immediate unless scheduled.

But they didn't specify exact departure and return dates, hotel preferences, meal inclusion, or language support. \n\nThe problem is that the API requires all those parameters. The user hasn't given the exact dates, so I need to ask for those. Also, hotel star rating is a required field, so I should prompt them about that. Meal inclusion and language support are optional, but since they're part of preferences, maybe the user has specific needs there. However, the API requires hotelStarRating, so I need to get that info. \n\nSo the missing parameters are travelDates (departure and return), hotelStarRating. The user mentioned July but not specific dates. So I should ask for the departure and return dates in July, and the hotel star rating. Also, maybe check if they want meals included and what language support they need. But according to the API's required fields, only destination, travelDates, budget, and preferences are required.

{"id": "special_incomplete_44", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to design a custom suit. They mentioned wool fabric, navy blue color, and a striped pattern. Looking at the available APIs, the customwear_design_suit seems appropriate.\n\nThe API requires userMeasurements, stylePreferences, and deliveryOptions. The user provided style preferences (fabric, color, pattern), but didn't mention measurements or delivery options. \n\nWait, the parameters for customwear_design_suit are userMeasurements (chest, waist, sleeveLength), stylePreferences (fabric, color, pattern), and deliveryOptions (deliveryDate). The user specified fabric, color, and pattern, so stylePreferences is covered. But userMeasurements and deliveryOptions are missing. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided the necessary measurements or delivery date, I need to ask for those. The required parameters are userMeasurements and stylePreferences. StylePreferences is there, but userMeasurements is missing. Also, deliveryOptions is part of the parameters but not required? Wait, looking back, the required fields for the API are ['userMeasurements', 'stylePreferences']. DeliveryOptions isn't required. But to proceed, maybe the user needs to provide measurements. So the missing parameters are chest, waist, and sleeveLength under userMeasurements. \n\nTherefore, the response should indicate that these parameters are missing.

{"id": "special_incomplete_45", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to optimize their Shure SM58 microphone settings for a live concert. First, I need to check which API to use. The available APIs include AudioPerformanceOptimizer_optimizeMicrophoneSettings, which seems relevant here.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that API: the microphone type and model are required. The user mentioned \"Shure SM58,\" which is a dynamic microphone. So the type would be 'dynamic' and model 'SM58'. The performanceTime is also required, but the user hasn't specified the time of day. They just said \"live concert,\" which could be any time. So I need to ask for the performance time. Also, the environment parameters like humidity and temperature are optional but might help. The soundSettings are optional as well, but without them, the API might use defaults. Since the user hasn't provided these, maybe I should proceed with the required fields and prompt for missing info if needed. Wait, the required parameters are microphone and performanceTime. The user hasn't given the performance time, so I need to ask for that. So the response should be to request the missing 'performanceTime' parameter. But wait, the user's message only mentions the microphone model. The microphone object requires both type and model. Since Shure SM58 is a dynamic mic, I can infer the type. So the microphone parameter is covered. But performanceTime is still missing. So the API call can't be made yet. Therefore, the correct step is to point out the missing 'performanceTime' parameter for the AudioPerformanceOptimizer_optimizeMicrophoneSettings API.\n</think>\n\n[\"Missing necessary parameters (performanceTime) for the api (AudioPerformanceOptimizer_optimizeMicrophoneSettings)\"]"}

The available API is skate_fit_recommend, which requires foot measurements: length, width, and arch height. The user hasn't provided any specific numbers yet.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the user has given all the necessary parameters. The API requires footMeasurements with length, width, and archHeight. The user's message doesn't include any of these values. So, according to scenario 2, since the information is incomplete, I should ask for the missing parameters. \n\nLooking at the API specs, the required parameters are length, width, and archHeight under footMeasurements. The user hasn't provided any of these. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that these parameters are missing. The output format should be [\"Missing necessary parameters (length, width, archHeight) for the api (skate_fit_recommend)\"]. \n\nI need to make sure I don't call the API without the required data.

The API available is HealthyMenuAnalyzer_analyzeNutrientProfile. The parameters required are menuItems and mealTime. The mealTime is set to Lunch here.\n\nBut looking at the conversation history, the user hasn't provided the actual menu items yet. They just asked if I can help. So the menuItems array, which is a list of dishes with ingredients and portions, is missing. The API requires both menuItems and mealTime. Since the user hasn't given the specific dishes and their ingredients, I can't proceed. \n\nI need to check if the user has provided all necessary parameters. In this case, they only mentioned the mealTime implicitly (lunch) but didn't list the menuItems. So the missing parameter is menuItems. According to the API specs, menuItems is required. Therefore, I should prompt them to provide the list of dishes with ingredients and portion sizes. The correct output here would be to indicate that the necessary parameters are missing.

The parameters required are employeeId, evaluationPeriod with start and end dates, and goals. The user hasn't provided the evaluation period dates or the specific goals details yet.\n\nThe user mentioned improving sales and customer service, but the API requires specific goals with descriptions, types, and metrics. Since the user hasn't given the start and end dates or the exact metrics and targets, I can't fill in those parameters. So I need to ask for the missing information. The required parameters missing are evaluationPeriod's start and end dates, and the details of the goals (goalDescription, goalType, metrics for each goal). \n\nI should prompt the user to provide the evaluation period dates and the specific goals they want to set, including the metrics and target values for each.

{"id": "special_incomplete_49", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to apply for a food safety license for their new restaurant. I need to figure out which API to use here. There are two APIs listed: foodSafety_applyForLicense and foodSafety_licenseApplication.\n\nFirst, looking at the descriptions. The first one mentions compliance with city ordinances, while the second one refers to federal guidelines and FDA regulations. The user didn't specify whether they need a city or federal license, but since they mentioned \"food safety license\" generally, maybe I should check both.\n\nLooking at the parameters for each. Both require applicant_details, business_details, and compliance_information. The business_details in the first API uses \"business_address\" and \"business_type\", while the second uses \"facility_address\" and \"facility_type\". The compliance_information in the first has \"ordinance\" and a boolean status, whereas the second has \"regulation\" (with specific enums) and a compliance status string.\n\nThe user hasn't provided any specific details yet. They just mentioned they need to apply for a license for a new restaurant. So, there's a lot missing. The required parameters for both APIs include name, address, business_name, business_address (or facility_address), and compliance info. Since the user hasn't provided any of these, I can't fill in the parameters. \n\nI need to ask for the missing information. For example, the applicant's name and address, the restaurant's name and address, the type of business (maybe from the enums in each API), and the compliance details. But since the user hasn't specified which API to use, maybe I should first ask if they need a city-level or federal-level license. That would determine which API to use.\n\nAlternatively, since both APIs are for food safety licenses but differ in scope (city vs federal), the user might not know the difference. I should clarify which one they need. Also, the compliance information requires specific details that vary between the two APIs. Without knowing which one they need, I can't proceed.\n\nSo the next step is to ask the user to specify whether they're applying under city ordinances or federal regulations. Additionally, request the missing parameters like applicant details, business details, and compliance information. But according to the problem's instructions, if the information is incomplete, I should point out the missing parameters for the relevant API. However, since the user hasn't specified which API to use, maybe I need to ask for clarification on that first.\n\nWait, the user's message is the first in the conversation history. The assistant hasn't responded yet. The user hasn't provided any parameters. So, for both APIs, the required parameters are missing. But since the user hasn't specified which API to use, I can't determine which one's parameters are missing. Therefore, the correct approach is to ask the user to clarify whether they need a city-based or federal-based license application. That would determine which API to use and then the required parameters can be identified.\n\nBut according to the problem's scenario 2, if the user's instructions lack key details required by the API, we should output [\"Missing necessary parameters ... for the api ...\"]. However, since the user hasn't specified which API to use, maybe we can't point to a specific API yet. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The user's request is general, so perhaps the assistant needs to ask for more information to determine which API to use and then identify the missing parameters for that specific API.\n\nIn this case, the user hasn't provided enough info to choose between the two APIs. So the assistant should ask for clarification on the type of license (city vs federal) and then proceed accordingly. But according to the problem's instructions, if the user's request exceeds the current capabilities, inform them. However, the user's request is valid but lacks necessary parameters. So the correct approach is to first ask for the missing parameters for the chosen API. But since the user hasn't chosen, the assistant needs to ask for clarification on which API to use.\n\nWait, the problem says that if the user's instructions lack key details required by the API, ask for the missing parameters. But here, the user hasn't even specified which API to use. So maybe the assistant should first ask the user to clarify which type of license they need (city or federal), which would determine which API to use. Then, once the API is determined, the assistant can list the missing parameters for that specific API.\n\nBut according to the problem's scenario 2(2), the output should be [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"]. However, since the user hasn't specified which API to use, the assistant can't determine which parameters are missing. Therefore, the assistant should first ask the user to clarify which API they need to use. But the problem's instructions don't mention that. The assistant is supposed to check if the user's instructions lack key details required by the API. Since the user hasn't provided any parameters,"}
