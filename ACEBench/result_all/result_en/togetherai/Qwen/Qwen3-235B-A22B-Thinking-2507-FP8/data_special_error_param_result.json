The user wants me to evaluate their rehab plan with ID 1234WrongID on October 21, 2023, with an effectiveness score of 8.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specifications for the RehabPlanEvaluator. The required parameters are plan_id, evaluation_date, and effectiveness_score. \n\nLooking at plan_id: the pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$$. The user provided \"1234WrongID\". Wait, the example given in the user's message is \"1234WrongID\" which seems to have a typo. Wait, the pattern allows alphanumeric characters and hyphens. Let me check the pattern again. The pattern is '^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$'. So it should only have letters, numbers, and hyphens. The user's input is \"1234WrongID\" which is alphanumeric, so that's okay. Wait, but maybe \"1234WrongID\" is correct? Wait, maybe the user made a typo in the ID. Wait, the problem says \"1234WrongID\" – perhaps the ID is supposed to have a hyphen but it's missing? Wait, the pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$, so hyphens are allowed but not required. So \"1234WrongID\" is valid as it's alphanumeric. Hmm, but maybe the user intended to write \"1234-WrongID\" but missed the hyphen? Wait, the user wrote \"1234WrongID\", which doesn't have a hyphen, but the pattern allows it. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake here. Wait, the problem states the user's message is \"Can you evaluate my rehab plan ID: 1234WrongID, on 2023-10-21 with an effectiveness of 8?\".\n\nWait, the plan_id parameter's pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$. So the ID should consist of letters, numbers, and hyphens. The user's ID is \"1234WrongID\", which is all alphanumeric, no hyphens. That's acceptable according to the pattern, right? Because the pattern allows alphanumeric and hyphens, but doesn't require hyphens. So maybe it's valid. Wait, but maybe the user made a typo. Wait, the user wrote \"1234WrongID\" – perhaps the correct ID should have a hyphen, like \"1234-WrongID\", but they missed it. But according to the given pattern, the current ID is valid. Wait, but let's check again. The pattern is '^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$'. So any combination of letters, numbers, and hyphens. So \"1234WrongID\" is all letters and numbers, so it's valid. So maybe the ID is okay.\n\nNext, evaluation_date: the user provided 2023-10-21, which is the current date (since the current time is October 21, 2023). The pattern is ^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$, so 2023-10-21 is correct.\n\nEffectiveness_score is 8, which is between 1 and 10, so that's valid.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"1234WrongID\" – maybe \"WrongID\" is part of the ID, but the problem is that perhaps the ID should follow a specific format, but the API only checks for alphanumeric and hyphens. So according to the API specs, it's acceptable. So maybe there's no error here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.\"\n\nWait, maybe the plan_id is supposed to have a certain format, but according to the API specs, it's just alphanumeric and hyphens. So \"1234WrongID\" is okay.\n\nWait, but maybe the user made a typo in the ID. Wait, the user wrote \"1234WrongID\" – perhaps they meant \"1234-WrongID\" but missed the hyphen. However, the API pattern allows it without a hyphen, so it's acceptable. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the parameters again. The RehabPlanEvaluator requires plan_id, evaluation_date, effectiveness_score. The user provided all three. The plan_id is \"1234WrongID\", which matches the pattern. Evaluation date is correct, score is 8. So all parameters are present and valid. Then why is the scenario here?\n\nWait, but looking back at the user's message: \"Can you evaluate my rehab plan ID: 1234WrongID, on 2023-10-21 with an effectiveness of 8?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the ID is \"1234WrongID\", but maybe the correct format should have a hyphen, but according to the API specs, it's allowed to not have hyphens. So maybe it's valid.\n\nWait, but the problem says in scenario 1 that if information is clear and unambiguous, use the candidate functions. But maybe there's an error here.

I need to check the API specifications for the DoubleSlitExperimentSearch.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that API, the publication_date requires a format of YYYY-MM-DD. The user provided \"12-Feb-2021\", which is in a different format (DD-MMM-YYYY). The correct format should be something like 2021-02-12. So the date given by the user doesn't match the required pattern. \n\nThe API's publication_date parameter has a pattern regex: ^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$. That means it needs four digits for the year, then two for the month, two for the day, separated by hyphens. The user's input uses \"Feb\" which is the month name, not the numeric value. So the value \"12-Feb-2021\" is invalid here.\n\nSince the parameter value doesn't fit the required format, this falls under scenario (1) where the value is incorrect. The correct response should point out the incorrect value for the publication_date parameter. The output needs to be in the specified format: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nSo the value is \"12-Feb-2021\" and the key is \"publication_date\".

{"id": "special_error_param_2", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking to check the stock volatility from last week for the ticker 'Goog'. First, I need to check which API can handle this request.\n\nLooking at the API specs, there's the WeeklyStockVolatility API. Its required parameters are ticker and end_date. The ticker has to be 1-4 uppercase letters, and the end_date is in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nThe user provided 'Goog' as the ticker. Wait, the ticker needs to be uppercase. 'Goog' is given with a capital G but the rest lowercase. The API requires all uppercase letters (pattern ^[A-Z]+$). So 'Goog' should be 'GOOG' to meet the pattern. Also, the length is 4, which is within the 1-4 limit.\n\nNext, the end_date. The user says \"last week\". Assuming today's date is needed to calculate last week's end date. But since the current date isn't provided, maybe the system will handle it, but the API requires a specific date. However, the user didn't specify the exact end date. The problem here is that the user mentioned \"last week\" but didn't give a specific date. The API requires end_date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nWait, the user's request lacks the end_date parameter. The WeeklyStockVolatility requires both ticker and end_date. The user only provided the ticker (though incorrectly formatted) and mentioned \"last week\", which isn't a specific date. So there are two issues: the ticker case and the missing end_date.\n\nBut according to the problem scenarios, first check if parameters have incorrect values. The ticker 'Goog' is not all uppercase, so it's an incorrect value for the ticker parameter. The API requires uppercase letters. So scenario (1) applies here: incorrect value for the parameter.\n\nHowever, the user also didn't provide the end_date, which is a required parameter. But the priority is first to check for incorrect parameter values. Wait, the user's message includes 'Goog' which is a value for ticker, but it's not in the correct format. So the ticker parameter has an incorrect value. The end_date is missing, but according to the priority order, first check if there's an incorrect value.\n\nWait, the required parameters for WeeklyStockVolatility are ticker and end_date. The user provided a ticker (though invalid) but no end_date. So there's both an invalid parameter value and a missing parameter.\n\nBut according to the strategy in scenario 2: first check if there's incorrect values (scenario 1). If yes, output that. If not, then check for missing parameters (scenario 2).\n\nIn this case, the ticker is given as 'Goog', which doesn't match the pattern ^[A-Z]+$ because it's 'Goog' (mixed case). So the value is incorrect. Therefore, scenario (1) applies: \"There is incorrect value (Goog) for the parameters (ticker) in the conversation history.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe the system is case-insensitive? But the API spec says the ticker must be uppercase letters. So 'Goog' is invalid. So the assistant should point out the incorrect value.\n\nHowever, the user also didn't provide the end_date. But according to the priority, first handle incorrect values. So the main issue here is the ticker's case. But the end_date is missing as well. Wait, the problem says: if the user's instructions include the key details required but the parameter values are incorrect, then scenario (1). If they lack key details, scenario (2).\n\nIn this case, the user provided a ticker (but incorrect) and didn't provide end_date. So both issues exist. But according to the priority order, first check for incorrect values. So the ticker is incorrect, so scenario (1) applies. The missing end_date is a separate issue, but since scenario (1) is triggered first, we should address the incorrect value first.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction includes the ticker (even if incorrect) but lacks the end_date. So maybe both issues are present. However, the priority is: first check if there's incorrect parameter values (scenario 1). If yes, output that. If not, then check for missing parameters.\n\nIn this case, the ticker is an incorrect value, so scenario 1 applies. Therefore, the output should be pointing out the incorrect value for ticker.\n\nBut the user also didn't provide end_date, which is required. However, according to the problem statement's note: \"The above steps have a priority order. You need to first determine whether scenario (1) applies. If it does, output according to the requirements in (1).\"\n\nSo even though there's a missing parameter, because there's an incorrect value, scenario (1) takes precedence.\n\nSo the correct output would be: [\"There is incorrect value (Goog) for the parameters (ticker) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, but the ticker parameter's value is 'Goog', which is not all uppercase. The API requires uppercase. So yes, it's an incorrect value.\n\nBut maybe the assistant should also mention the missing end_date? But according to the instructions, if scenario (1) applies, output only that. So even if there are multiple issues, if scenario (1) is triggered, we only address that first.\n\nHence, the answer should be pointing out the incorrect ticker value.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (Goog) for the parameters (ticker) in the conversation history.\"]"}

Looking at the available APIs, there's the Network_Condition_Check function. Let me check its parameters.\n\nThe required parameters for Network_Condition_Check are location, ping_time, packet_loss, and connection_type. The user provided the location as \"45.ABC,-120.33\". Wait, the location parameter needs to be in latitude and longitude format with the pattern: ^-?\\d{1,2}\\.\\d+,\\s*-?\\d{1,3}\\.\\d+$. \n\nBreaking down the user's input: 45.ABC,-120.33. The latitude part is 45.ABC. But the pattern requires digits only after the decimal. ABC isn't a number, so this is invalid. The correct format should be numbers like 45.123, -120.456. Here, \"ABC\" is invalid because it's not a digit. So the location parameter has an incorrect value.\n\nThe user didn't provide ping_time, packet_loss, or connection_type. But since the error is in the location format first, according to scenario 2(1), if the parameter type or form doesn't match, I should point out the incorrect value. The location is required and the value given doesn't match the regex pattern. So the output should be indicating the incorrect value for the location parameter.\n\nI need to check if other parameters are missing, but since the location is already invalid, the first priority is to correct that. The user might have mistyped the coordinates. So the response should state there's an incorrect value for the location parameter.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (45.ABC,-120.33) for the parameters (location) in the conversation history.\"]"}

First, I need to check which API can handle this request.\n\nLooking at the API specifications, there's the OperaTicketDetails function. Its required parameter is event_id, which must match the pattern ^[A-Z0-9]{8}$. The user provided \"event123\" as the ID. Let me check the pattern: it needs to be 8 characters, uppercase letters or digits. \"event123\" is 9 characters long (e-v-e-n-t-1-2-3), so it's too long. The pattern requires exactly 8 characters. Also, the example given in the API specs is like 'A-Z0-9]{8}', so \"event123\" doesn't fit because it's 9 characters and starts with lowercase letters.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"event123\" in quotes. The event_id parameter requires a string of exactly 8 uppercase letters or numbers. The given ID is \"event123\", which is 9 characters (e v e n t 1 2 3) – that's 9. So it's invalid. Also, the letters are lowercase, but the pattern might accept uppercase and digits. But even if case-insensitive, the length is wrong.\n\nSo the problem here is that the event_id provided by the user doesn't match the required format. The API expects 8 characters, but the user gave 9. Therefore, this falls under scenario 2(1): incorrect parameter value.\n\nThe correct output should point out the incorrect value for the event_id parameter. The required pattern is 8 characters, but \"event123\" is 9. So the response should be [\"There is incorrect value (event123) for the parameters (event_id) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The user wrote \"event123\" – let's count the characters: e (1), v (2), e (3), n (4), t (5), 1 (6), 2 (7), 3 (8). Wait, that's 8 characters. Wait, e-v-e-n-t-1-2-3 is 8 characters? Let's see: e (1), v (2), e (3), n (4), t (5), 1 (6), 2 (7), 3 (8). Oh, maybe it is 8. Wait, \"event123\" – e v e n t 1 2 3. That's 8 characters. But the pattern is ^[A-Z0-9]{8}$, so all characters must be uppercase letters or digits. However, \"event123\" starts with lowercase letters. So the letters are lowercase, which doesn't match the pattern that expects uppercase. For example, if it was \"EVENT123\", that would be 8 uppercase letters and digits. But \"event123\" has lowercase 'e', 'v', etc.\n\nSo the event_id provided is invalid because it contains lowercase letters and possibly the length? Wait, \"event123\" is 8 characters: e(1), v(2), e(3), n(4), t(5), 1(6), 2(7), 3(8). So length is 8, but the letters are lowercase. The regex ^[A-Z0-9]{8}$ requires uppercase letters (A-Z) or digits (0-9). Lowercase letters are not allowed. Therefore, \"event123\" is invalid because of the lowercase letters.\n\nTherefore, the parameter event_id has an incorrect value.

Let me look at its parameters. The model_name has to be alphanumeric and between 3-50 characters. The pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9\\s]+$. Wait, the user provided 'xyz#123'. The '#' symbol isn't alphanumeric, so that's a problem. The model_name can't have special characters like #.\n\nAlso, review_count is 300, which is a positive integer, so that's okay. But the model name is invalid because of the #. So according to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value doesn't match the API's definition, I need to point out the incorrect value.\n\nThe user's model name 'xyz#123' contains a '#', which isn't allowed. The required format is alphanumeric (letters and numbers only, plus spaces). So the error is in the model_name parameter with the value 'xyz#123'. \n\nTherefore, the correct response should be indicating that the model name has an incorrect value because of the '#'.

The pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{8,12}$, so only letters and numbers allowed. So both IDs are invalid.\n\nThe user provided device IDs that don't meet the format requirements. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions, I should point out the incorrect values. \n\nFor ABC123: length is 6, which is less than 8. For XYZ@4321: contains '@' which is invalid. So both have issues. The output should state there's incorrect values for the parameters device_id and compare_with.\n\nWait, the parameters are device_id and compare_with. The user provided ABC123 and XYZ@4321. So both parameters have incorrect values. The error message should mention both values and the respective keys.\n\nThe correct output format for scenario (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut since both parameters have issues, maybe list both.

The output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\"\n\nWait, maybe each incorrect parameter should be listed separately?

But the user provided two invalid parameters.\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"output according to the requirements in (1)\", which is a single string inside the brackets.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to list both incorrect values and parameters in one message.\n\nFor example: [\"There is incorrect value (ABC123) for the parameters (device_id) and incorrect value (XYZ@4321) for the parameters (compare_with) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the example given in the problem statement uses singular. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe output format for (1) is: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nSo maybe it's expecting each incorrect parameter to be mentioned. But the problem says \"output according to the requirements in (1)\", which is a single string. So perhaps combine both into one message.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects to list all incorrect parameters in one message.\n\nIn this case, device_id is ABC123 (too short), compare_with is XYZ@4321 (invalid character). So the message would state both.\n\nSo the correct output should be: [\"There is incorrect value (ABC123) for the parameters (device_id) and incorrect value (XYZ@4321) for the parameters (compare_with) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the problem's example uses \"value\" and \"key\" in singular.

The seafood ingredient they mentioned is Shrimp@123.\n\nFirst, I need to check the relevant API. The SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder seems right because it's for substituting seafood ingredients. Let me look at its parameters.\n\nThe required parameter is seafood_ingredient. The user provided \"Shrimp@123\". Wait, the API says the seafood_ingredient must be a string between 3 and 40 characters, and the pattern isn't specified except for min and max length. But \"Shrimp@123\" has numbers and a symbol. Wait, looking back, the parameters for seafood_ingredient have minLength 3, maxLength 40. The desired_texture has a pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]+$. The user said 'crispy', which is all letters, so that's okay. Cooking_method is 'frying', which is valid.\n\nWait, but the seafood_ingredient parameter: the description says \"The specific seafood ingredient you want to substitute.\" The user wrote \"Shrimp@123\". The problem here is that the ingredient name might not be valid because it contains numbers and a special character. The API's seafood_ingredient parameter's type is string with minLength 3 and maxLength 40, but there's no pattern specified for it. Wait, checking the API specs again:\n\nFor SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder, the seafood_ingredient has:\n'description': 'The specific seafood ingredient you want to substitute.', 'type': 'string', 'minLength': 3, 'maxLength': 40\n\nNo pattern specified here, so maybe numbers and symbols are allowed? But usually, ingredient names are just letters. However, the user input is \"Shrimp@123\". The '@' and numbers might not be valid. Wait, but the API doesn't restrict it with a regex, only length. So as long as it's between 3-40 chars, it's okay. Let's check the length: \"Shrimp@123\" is 10 characters, which is within 3-40. So maybe it's acceptable. But maybe the system expects a valid ingredient name without numbers. However, the API doesn't specify that, so according to the specs, it's valid.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"Shrimp@123\" which might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"Shrimp\" but added some extra characters. The API requires the seafood_ingredient, which should be the actual ingredient. So \"Shrimp@123\" is not a standard ingredient name, but the API doesn't have a pattern for it, only length. So the parameter value here is \"Shrimp@123\", which meets the length requirement. However, perhaps the system expects a clean name like \"shrimp\". But according to the problem statement, if the parameter's description doesn't specify a required format, use the user's original text.\n\nWait, in scenario 1, it says: \"If the API parameter description does not specify the required format for the value, use the user's original text for the parameter value.\"\n\nLooking at seafood_ingredient parameter: description doesn't specify a format beyond min and max length, which it meets. So the value should be \"Shrimp@123\" as per user's input.\n\nBut wait, the desired_texture is 'crispy', which the user wrote as 'crispy' (they said \"texture like 'crispy'\"), which matches the pattern ^[a-zA-Z]+$ since it's all letters. Cooking_method is 'frying', which is valid (minLength 3, 'frying' is 6 chars).\n\nSo the API call would be SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder(seafood_ingredient='Shrimp@123', desired_texture='crispy', cooking_method='frying').\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"Shrimp@123\" – the '@123' part might be a mistake. Maybe they intended just \"Shrimp\". However, according to the instructions, if the parameter doesn't have a specified format (other than min/max length), use the user's original text. Since seafood_ingredient only has min and max length, not a regex, the value is acceptable as is. So the API should be called with that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says in scenario 2(1): if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions. Let's check again.\n\nThe seafood_ingredient parameter's type is string, min 3, max 40. \"Shrimp@123\" is 10 characters, so it's within limits. The API doesn't have a pattern for this parameter, so it's acceptable. Therefore, the value is correct.\n\nWait, but the user might have made a typo. However, the assistant's job is to use the original text unless the API specifies a format. Since the API doesn't restrict the characters (only length), the value is okay.\n\nTherefore, the correct API call is SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder with those parameters.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The user said: \"The seafood ingredient is Shrimp@123.\" So the ingredient is Shrimp@123. Maybe it's a specific product name, but the API doesn't care as long as it's a string of correct length.

The required parameters are device_id and privacy_level. \n\nLooking at device_id: it must be a 12-character alphanumeric string. The user provided \"12345\", which is only 5 characters. That's too short. The pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{12}$, so exactly 12 characters. \n\nPrivacy_level is set to \"high\", which is valid since the enum includes 'low', 'medium', 'high'. So that part is okay.\n\nThe problem is the device_id. It doesn't meet the required length. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value type or form is incorrect, I should point out the incorrect value. \n\nSo the error here is that \"12345\" is not 12 characters.

{"id": "special_error_param_10", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for plants for a room that's 250 square feet with moist air conditions. First, I need to check the API specifications to see what parameters are required.\n\nThe API is PlantSelectorByEnvironment. It requires humidity_level and room_size. Humidity_level has to be 'low', 'medium', or 'high'. The user mentioned \"moist air conditions\", which probably corresponds to 'high' humidity. But wait, the enum options are low, medium, high. So moist might be high. But maybe the user's term \"moist\" is equivalent to high here.\n\nNext, room_size is in square meters, but the user provided 250 square feet. Oh, right, the API expects square meters. So I need to convert 250 square feet to square meters. Let me calculate that. 1 square meter is about 10.764 square feet. So 250 divided by 10.764 is approximately 23.22576687 square meters. But the API requires an integer. The room_size parameter is an integer with a minimum of 5 and maximum of 100. So 23.225... would round to 23. But the user said 250 square feet, which is around 23.22 m², so the integer value would be 23.\n\nWait, but the API's room_size is in square meters and must be an integer. However, the user gave square feet. So the assistant needs to convert it. But does the assistant do the conversion, or is the user supposed to provide it in square meters? The API specs say room_size is in square meters, so the user's input of 250 sq ft is not in the correct unit. Therefore, the parameter value as given by the user (250) is in square feet, but the API expects square meters. So if the assistant uses 250 directly, it's incorrect because 250 square meters is way larger than the allowed maximum of 100. Wait, 250 square feet is about 23 m², which is within 5-100. But the user said 250 square feet, which is not the unit the API uses.\n\nSo the problem here is that the user provided room_size in square feet, but the API requires square meters. Therefore, the parameter room_size is given in the wrong unit. The API expects an integer in square meters, so 250 (as square feet) is not valid. But since the assistant is supposed to handle this, maybe it should convert it. Wait, but the instructions say: \"If the API parameter description does not specify the required format for the value, use the user's original text for the parameter value.\" However, in this case, the parameter does specify the unit (square meters). So the user's value is in square feet, which is incorrect.\n\nSo according to scenario 2(1): if the parameter value type or form doesn't match, point out the incorrect value. The user provided 250 square feet, but the API needs room_size in square meters. Therefore, the value 250 is incorrect because it's in the wrong unit. The correct approach is to either convert it (but the assistant might not be allowed to assume conversion) or flag the error.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"When the information provided by the user is unclear, incomplete, or incorrect...\" In this case, the user provided room_size as 250 square feet, but the API requires square meters. So the value is incorrect in terms of unit. Therefore, this falls under scenario 2(1): incorrect value for the parameter.\n\nThe output should be: [\"There is incorrect value (250) for the parameters (room_size) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, but the user said \"250 square feet\", so the value is 250, but the unit is wrong. The parameter expects square meters, so 250 as a number is too big if taken as square meters (since max is 100). But 250 square feet is ~23 m², which is within range. However, the user didn't convert it, so the assistant can't assume they meant square meters. Therefore, the parameter room_size is given as 250, which in square meters is over the maximum (100), but the user actually meant square feet. So the value 250 is invalid because either it's in the wrong unit or the number is too big.\n\nWait, the API's room_size has a minimum of 5 and maximum of 100, in square meters. If the user says 250 square feet, converting to ~23 m², which is within 5-100. But the user wrote 250, which if taken as square meters would be invalid (over 100). However, the user specified \"square feet\", so the assistant should recognize that the unit is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, the API parameters have specific requirements. The room_size parameter is defined as 'The size of the room in square meters.' So the user must provide the value in square meters. Since they provided it in square feet, the value is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should point out that the room_size value is incorrect because it's in square feet instead of square meters. So the output should be the error message for incorrect parameter value.\n\nSo the correct response is scenario 2(1): [\"There is incorrect value (250) for the parameters (room_size) in"}

The pattern is ^\\d{5}$, so it needs exactly 5 digits. That's a problem.\n\nProject deadline is 2023-11-30, which looks like a valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Looking at the API specs, there's AuthenticateAndRecycle which requires email and phone_serial_number. The email must be a valid format. The user's email is user!example.com. Wait, valid emails shouldn't have an exclamation mark like that. Usually, emails use @, like user@example.com. Here, they have a '!' instead of '@', which is invalid. So the email format is wrong.\n\nThe phone serial number is ABC12345678. Let's check the requirements: alphanumeric, 10-20 characters. ABC12345678 is 12 characters, all alphanumeric, so that's good.\n\nBut the email is invalid. The API requires a valid email format. So the user provided an incorrect email value. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter type/form doesn't match, we need to point out the incorrect value.\n\nSo the error is with the email parameter.

So country_name is invalid.\n\nThe required parameters are country_name, and year is optional but the user specified 2022.

{"id": "special_error_param_14", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to analyze the website security for 123.abc.web.\n\nFirst, I need to check which API can handle this. Looking at the API specs, there's the WebsiteSecurityAnalyzer. Its required parameter is website_url, which must match a valid URL pattern. The pattern given is ^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z.-]+)\\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\\/\\w .-]*)*\\/?$.\n\nThe user provided \"123.abc.web\". Let me check if this fits the pattern. Breaking it down: the domain part here is 123.abc.web. The TLD should be 2-6 letters, but \"web\" is a valid TLD (like .website), but wait, the pattern allows [a-z.]{2,6}, so \"web\" is 3 characters, which is okay. However, the subdomains: 123.abc. Wait, the third part is \"web\" which is the TLD. But typically, a URL would have something like example.com, but here it's 123.abc.web. Let me check if the regex matches.\n\nThe regex starts with optional http:// or https://, then [\\da-z.-]+ which is the subdomain (123.abc), then \\.([a-z.]{2,6}) which is the TLD. Wait, the TLD part here is \"web\", which is 3 letters, so that's okay. But the problem is that the domain part (before the TLD) is 123.abc. The regex allows [\\da-z.-]+ for the domain, so numbers and hyphens are allowed. So 123.abc is acceptable as a subdomain? Wait, but in a standard URL, the structure is [subdomain.]domain.TLD. Here, it's 123.abc.web. So 123 is a subdomain of abc, which is the domain, and web is the TLD. But is \"abc.web\" a valid domain? Maybe, but the regex should accept it as long as it fits the pattern.\n\nWait, the regex for website_url is: ^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z.-]+)\\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\\/\\w .-]*)*\\/?$\n\nBreaking down 123.abc.web:\n\n- The part after http:// would be 123.abc.web.\n\n- [\\da-z.-]+ matches 123.abc (since it's alphanumeric and dots)\n\n- Then a literal dot \\.\n\n- Then [a-z.]{2,6} which is \"web\" (3 characters, so valid)\n\n- Then the rest (optional path) which isn't present here.\n\nSo the regex would match 123.abc.web as [\\da-z.-]+ being \"123.abc\", then dot, then \"web\" as the TLD part.\n\nWait, but in reality, domain names can have multiple subdomains, but the TLD is the last part. So 123.abc.web would have TLD \"web\", domain \"abc\", and subdomain \"123\". But the regex seems to capture the entire part before the TLD as the domain, which in this case is \"123.abc\". However, the regex allows [\\da-z.-]+ for that part, so numbers and hyphens are okay. So the URL \"123.abc.web\" would technically fit the regex.\n\nWait, but maybe the user made a typo. The standard TLDs are like .com, .org, but newer ones like .web exist. However, the problem is whether the given URL is valid according to the API's pattern.\n\nWait, the pattern for website_url requires that after the optional http://, there's a part matching [\\da-z.-]+, then a dot, then [a-z.]{2,6}, etc. So 123.abc.web would split as:\n\n- [\\da-z.-]+ = 123.abc\n\n- \\. = .\n\n- [a-z.]{2,6} = web\n\nSo yes, it matches. But wait, the TLD part [a-z.]{2,6} allows dots? Wait, the pattern is [a-z.]{2,6}, so it can include dots. But in reality, TLDs don't have dots. For example, .co.uk is a country code TLD, but that's two parts. However, the regex here might be too permissive.\n\nBut according to the API's specification, the pattern is as given, so if the user's input matches that regex, it's acceptable. Let's check if \"123.abc.web\" matches the regex.\n\nThe entire string is 123.abc.web.\n\nThe regex starts with optional http:// or https://, which the user didn't include, so that part is skipped.\n\nThen ([\\da-z.-]+) matches 123.abc (since it's alphanumeric and dots).\n\nThen a literal dot \\., so the next part is .web.\n\nThen ([a-z.]{2,6}) which is 'web' (3 characters, all letters), so that's valid.\n\nThen the rest of the pattern allows optional path, which isn't present here.\n\nSo yes, \"123.abc.web\" matches the regex. Wait, but the regex for the TLD part is [a-z.]{2,6}, which allows dots. So if someone writes something like example.co.uk, it would have 'co.uk' as the TLD part here, but in reality, the TLD is '"}

The user provided \"bob@@example.com\". Wait, there's a double @ symbol here. The correct email format shouldn't have two @s. Let me check the regex.\n\nThe pattern starts with [\\w-\\.]+, which allows word characters, hyphens, and dots. Then @, followed by ([\\w-]+\\.)+ which is one or more domain parts, and ending with [\\w-]{2,4} for the TLD.\n\nThe user's email is \"bob@@example.com\".

So the province_name parameter is invalid because of the digits.\n\nThe year is 2023, which is a valid four-digit number within the range. So the problem is with the province name.

Wait, the origin should be a district name in Chinese. Beijing321 doesn't look like a valid district name; it seems to have numbers. The pattern for origin is ^[\\u4e00-\\u9fa5]{2,10}$, meaning only Chinese characters, 2 to 10 in length. So \"Beijing321\" is invalid because it contains numbers and maybe English letters. The correct district names would be like 朝阳区, 海淀区, etc.\n\nThe destination is \"Chaoyang\", which is probably 朝阳区 (Chaoyang District), but the user wrote it in English. However, the API expects Chinese characters. So both origin and destination parameters are problematic here.\n\nThe required parameters for TrafficAwareBusRoute are origin and destination, both must be Chinese districts. The user's input uses \"Beijing321\" which is not valid, and \"Chaoyang\" which is in English.

The origin is supposed to be Chinese characters but has numbers and maybe English. So the error is in the origin parameter value.\n\nWait, the user said \"Beijing321\" – maybe they meant a specific location, but the API requires the district name in Chinese. So the correct approach is to inform the user that the origin parameter is invalid because it doesn't match the required format (only Chinese characters).

However, the example given in the API description says \"It must be between 3 and 50 characters.\" So the city name can include numbers? The user wrote \"123City\", which is 7 characters, so length is okay. Wait, but maybe the API expects a real city name without numbers. But the spec doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is the city name \"123City\". The API for RealEstateInvestmentOpportunities has city_name with minLength 3, maxLength 50, but no pattern. So technically, \"123City\" is 7 characters, which is within 3-50. So maybe it's acceptable. But maybe the API actually expects a valid city name, which typically doesn't start with numbers. However, the API spec doesn't mention that, so maybe the user's input is okay.\n\nWait, the budget range is given as \"100000-500000\", which matches the pattern ^\\d+-\\d+$, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"budget 100000-500000\" which is correctly formatted. So both parameters are present. But the city name is \"123City\". Let me check if the city_name parameter in the API has any hidden constraints. The description says \"The name of the city to explore for investment opportunities. It must be between 3 and 50 characters.\" So no regex, just length. \"123City\" is 7 characters, so okay. So the parameters are correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the assistant should check if the city name is valid. However, the API doesn't have a pattern for city_name, so the assistant can't assume it's invalid.

However, the API doesn't validate if the city exists, just the format. So the assistant should proceed.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that \"123City\" starts with numbers, which is unusual for city names, but the API doesn't restrict it.

The city_name must be between 3 and 50 characters. The user mentioned \"New@York\". Wait, the city name has an @ symbol. The API's description for city_name says it's a string with min 3 and max 50 characters, but doesn't specify allowed characters. However, typically city names don't have symbols like @. Maybe that's a typo. The user probably meant \"New York\".\n\nAlso, the budget_range is specified as '100000-500000', which matches the pattern ^\\d+-\\d+$. So that part is correct.\n\nBut the city_name parameter: \"New@York\" includes an @ which might not be valid. The API's parameter for city_name has a minLength and maxLength but no pattern. Wait, the API specs for city_name say it must be between 3-50 chars, but no regex. However, in reality, city names shouldn't have special characters like @. So the user might have made a typo. The correct city name is \"New York\" without the @.\n\nSo the problem here is that the city_name provided by the user has an invalid character. According to the API specifications, even though there's no explicit pattern, city names typically don't include symbols. But the API's parameter description doesn't specify allowed characters beyond length. Wait, looking back: the RealEstateInvestmentOpportunities' city_name parameter says \"It must be between 3 and 50 characters.\" There's no mention of allowed characters, so technically \"New@York\" is 8 characters, which is within 3-50. But maybe the system expects valid city names without special characters. However, the API's parameter doesn't have a pattern, so maybe it's acceptable. Wait, but the user wrote \"New@York\" which is probably a mistake for \"New York\".\n\nWait, the API specs for city_name: \"The name of the city to explore for investment opportunities. It must be between 3 and 50 characters.\" So the only constraints are length. So \"New@York\" is 8 characters, which is okay. But maybe the backend system expects valid city names, but according to the API specs given, there's no restriction on characters. Hmm, but the user might have intended \"New York\" and the @ is a typo.\n\nWait, the problem here is that the user input has \"New@York\" which is likely a typo. The assistant should check if the city name is valid. But according to the API specs provided, there's no pattern for city_name, only min and max length. So technically, \"New@York\" is acceptable as per the API's definition. However, in reality, city names don't have @ symbols, so this might be an error.\n\nWait, the API's parameter for city_name is defined as type string, minLength 3, maxLength 50. There's no regex pattern, so the @ is allowed. But the user probably meant \"New York\". So the assistant should check if the city name is correctly spelled. Since the API doesn't validate the content beyond length, but the user's input has a typo, the assistant should flag that.\n\nWait, according to scenario 2(1): if the parameter value's type or form doesn't match the API's definitions. But in this case, the API's definition for city_name allows any string of 3-50 chars, so \"New@York\" is technically valid. However, the @ is likely a typo. But the API specs don't say anything about allowed characters, so the assistant can't assume it's invalid. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"New@York\" which is 8 characters. The API requires 3-50, so it's within length. But the @ symbol is not part of a standard city name. However, the API's parameter description doesn't specify that the city name must be a valid real-world city or restrict characters. So strictly speaking, according to the provided API specs, the value is acceptable. But in reality, the system might expect a proper city name.\n\nBut the problem is that the user might have made a typo. The correct city name is \"New York\" (with a space, not @). So the assistant should check if the city name is correctly formatted. However, the API specs don't have a pattern for city_name, so the assistant can't know that @ is invalid. Wait, but maybe the user intended \"New York\" and the @ is a mistake from typing \"New York\" with a shifted key (like Shift+2 is @, so maybe they meant \"New York\" but typed \"New@York\" by accident).\n\nIn that case, the parameter value is incorrect because the city name should be \"New York\" without the @. Since the API's parameter doesn't have a pattern, but the user's input has an invalid character for a city name, the assistant should point out that the city name has an incorrect value.\n\nWait, according to scenario 2(1): if the user's instructions include key details but the parameter values don't match the API's definitions.

{"id": "special_error_param_23", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to check the safety of their payment info on www.shoppingexample.com using Bitcoin.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the API specifications. The available API is PaymentInfoSafetyCheck. It requires payment_method, site_url, and has optional encryption_check.\n\nLooking at the payment_method parameter: the enum lists 'credit card', 'PayPal', 'bank transfer'. The user mentioned Bitcoin, which isn't in the enum. So that's a problem.\n\nThe site_url is www.shoppingexample.com. The pattern requires a valid URL. The user's input is missing the protocol (http:// or https://), but the pattern allows it to be optional. Wait, the pattern is '^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\\\da-z.-]+)\\\\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\\\\/\\\\w .-]*)*\\\\/?$'. So www.shoppingexample.com might not match because it's missing the top-level domain? Wait, www.shoppingexample.com has 'com' as the TLD, which is two letters, but the pattern says [a-z.]{2,6}. Wait, 'com' is three letters. Wait, the pattern for the TLD part is ([a-z.]{2,6}), which would allow 'com' (3 letters). So www.shoppingexample.com is actually a valid domain? Wait, but the URL as given is www.shoppingexample.com. The pattern expects something like example.com, but www.shoppingexample.com is a valid domain name. Wait, maybe the user intended shoppingexample.com but wrote www.shoppingexample.com as the domain. But according to the regex, it should match. Let me check: the regex is ^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z.-]+)\\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\\/\\w .-]*)*\\/?$.\n\nBreaking down www.shoppingexample.com:\n\n- The part before the TLD would be www.shoppingexample, but wait, the regex has ([\\da-z.-]+)\\.([a-z.]{2,6}), so the domain is something like example.com. But www.shoppingexample.com would split into 'www.shoppingexample' as the subdomain and 'com' as TLD. Wait, but the regex might not handle multiple dots correctly. Hmm, maybe the site_url provided by the user is not a valid URL format because it's missing the protocol and perhaps the structure. Wait, the user wrote \"www.shoppingexample.com\", which is a common way to write a domain, but technically a full URL should have http:// or https://. However, the regex allows the protocol to be optional. Let's see:\n\nThe regex starts with (https?:\\/\\/)? so the protocol is optional. Then ([\\da-z.-]+) is the domain part, then \\.([a-z.]{2,6}) for the TLD. So www.shoppingexample.com would be:\n\n- [\\da-z.-]+ matches www-shoppingexample (but with dots), so www.shoppingexample is the domain part, then .com as the TLD. So the regex would accept it. Wait, but www.shoppingexample.com is a valid domain name? Maybe the user missed the 'http://' but the API's pattern allows it. So maybe the site_url is acceptable.\n\nBut the main issue is the payment_method. The user said Bitcoin, but the enum only has credit card, PayPal, bank transfer. So Bitcoin is not a valid option here. That's a problem. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value is incorrect (not in enum), we need to output [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"].\n\nSo the payment_method is Bitcoin, which is not in the enum. So the correct output should point out that Bitcoin is not a valid payment method for this API.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (Bitcoin) for the parameters (payment_method) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_24", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking to analyze the company's culture with ID 123ABC using Glassdoor data. The API they need to use is CompanyCultureInsights.\n\nFirst, check the parameters. The company_id must be an 8-digit numeric string. The user provided \"123ABC\", which is not numeric and has letters. The pattern requires exactly 8 digits, so this is invalid.\n\nThe review_source is Glassdoor, which is in the enum list, so that's okay. But the company_id is the problem here. Since the parameter value doesn't match the required format (it's supposed to be 8 digits, but has letters), this falls under scenario 2(1) where the value is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct output should point out the incorrect value for company_id. The error is that 123ABC isn't 8 digits. The message should state \"There is incorrect value (123ABC) for the parameters (company_id) in the conversation history.\"\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (123ABC) for the parameters (company_id) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_25", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me work through this step by step. The user is asking to notify responsible parties about tasks from a meeting using WhatsApp. First, I need to check which API might handle this.\n\nLooking at the API specs, the TaskAssignmentNotifier seems relevant. Its parameters require meeting_summary (min 50 chars), notification_method (enum: email or SMS), and responsible_party_list (array of emails/phone numbers).\n\nThe user provided the meeting summary as 'Discuss budget, assign tasks', but that's only 30 characters, which is under the 50 required. So the meeting_summary is too short. Also, they want to use WhatsApp, but the notification_method only allows email or SMS. WhatsApp isn't an option here. \n\nSo there are two issues: the meeting summary is too short, and the notification method isn't supported. According to the problem scenarios, first check if parameters have incorrect values. The notification_method 'WhatsApp' isn't in the enum, so that's an incorrect value. Also, missing responsible_party_list since the user didn't provide any contacts.\n\nBut the priority is scenario (1) for incorrect parameter values. The notification_method is invalid. So the output should point out the incorrect value for notification_method. However, the meeting_summary is also too short, but maybe the main issue here is the notification method. Wait, the required parameters for TaskAssignmentNotifier are meeting_summary and notification_method. The user provided meeting_summary but it's too short, which is a problem. But the user's instruction says \"if the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions\", so both meeting_summary length and notification_method are issues.\n\nWait, the problem says first check scenario (1): incorrect parameter values. So for notification_method, WhatsApp is invalid. The API only allows email or SMS. So the value 'WhatsApp' is incorrect for notification_method. Also, meeting_summary is 30 chars, which is below 50. So two errors. But the problem says \"if the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match\".\n\nSo both parameters have issues. However, the required parameters are meeting_summary and notification_method. The user provided both, but the values are invalid. So according to scenario (1), we need to point out the incorrect values.\n\nThe output format for (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut there are two parameters with issues: meeting_summary (too short) and notification_method (invalid). However, the problem says \"the parameter values does not match the API's definitions\". For meeting_summary, the value's length is invalid. For notification_method, the value isn't in the enum.\n\nSo how to handle multiple incorrect parameters? The instruction says \"ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details\", but the output format for (1) is a single string mentioning the incorrect value and parameter.\n\nBut the example given in the problem for (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"], which seems to handle one parameter. However, in this case, there are two parameters with issues.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement for scenario (1): \"If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.\"\n\nSo both parameters are provided but incorrect. The output should list the incorrect parameters. However, the specified output format for (1) uses singular \"parameters (key)\", but maybe it's supposed to handle multiple.\n\nWait, the example shows \"parameters (key)\", but maybe it's a typo and should be \"parameter (key)\". Regardless, the instruction says to output in that format. So perhaps for each incorrect parameter, but the problem says the output must be in that exact format.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\"\n\nBut in this case, there are two parameters: notification_method has incorrect value 'WhatsApp', and meeting_summary has a value that's too short (30 chars < 50). So how to represent both?\n\nHmm, the problem might expect that we prioritize the first encountered issue or list all. But according to the problem statement, the output should be a single string in that format. However, the example uses singular \"value\" and \"parameters (key)\".\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to list all incorrect parameters in the message. For example:\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (WhatsApp) for the parameters (notification_method) and value (Discuss budget, assign tasks) for parameters (meeting_summary) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the problem's example doesn't specify multiple, so perhaps the assistant should check the priority. Wait, the problem says the steps have priority order: first check (1), if applicable, output according to (1). So even if there are multiple issues, as long as any parameter has incorrect value/type, we use (1).\n\nBut how to format multiple parameters? The problem's example shows a single parameter. Maybe the correct answer here is to point out the notification_method first because it's an enum violation, which is a clear incorrect value, whereas the meeting_summary length is also an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main issue is the notification_method since WhatsApp isn't allowed. The meeting_summary might be considered as missing if it's too short, but the user did provide it, just not meeting the minLength.\n\nWait, the API requires meeting_summary to be at least 50 characters. The user provided 'Discuss budget, assign tasks' which is 30 characters. So the value is"}
{"id": "special_error_param_26", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to set a sleep reminder with the message \"Night\" at 10 pm. I need to check the API specifications for the SleepReminderApp.\n\nFirst, looking at the required parameters for SleepReminderApp: reminder_message and reminder_time are required. The user provided \"Night\" as the message and 10 pm as the time.\n\nWait, the reminder_message needs to be between 10 and 100 characters. \"Night\" is only 5 characters, which is too short. That's a problem. The minimum length is 10, so the current message is invalid.\n\nAlso, the reminder_time should be in 24-hour format HH:MM. The user said 10 pm, which is 22:00. But they wrote it as 10 pm, not 22:00. The API requires the time in 24-hour format, so I need to convert that. However, the user didn't specify it correctly. But maybe the assistant can handle converting 10 pm to 22:00. However, the parameter's pattern is ^([01]\\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\\d)$, so it needs to be like 22:00.\n\nBut the user said \"10 pm\", which is not in the correct format. Wait, the reminder_time parameter requires the time in 24-hour format as a string. So 10 pm would be 22:00. However, the user provided \"10 pm\" which is 12-hour format with \"pm\", which doesn't match the required pattern. The API expects something like \"22:00\".\n\nSo, the reminder_time value given by the user is incorrect. Also, the message is too short.\n\nSo according to scenario 2(1), if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions, we need to point out the incorrect values.\n\nLooking at the parameters:\n\n- reminder_message: \"Night\" is 5 characters, but min is 10. So invalid.\n- reminder_time: \"10 pm\" is not in HH:MM 24h format. Should be \"22:00\".\n\nSo there are two incorrect parameters here. The output should state the incorrect values for the parameters.\n\nThe required output format for scenario (1) is: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut here, there are two parameters with issues. How to handle multiple parameters?\n\nThe instruction says \"if the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.\"\n\nIn this case, both parameters have issues. So the assistant should point out both.\n\nWait, the output format example given in scenario (1) is: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut if there are multiple parameters, maybe list both. However, the example shows a single parameter. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn scenario (1), the output should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, the problem says \"ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details. The output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\"\n\nWait, maybe for each parameter that's incorrect, but the example shows one. However, the way it's phrased is \"parameters (key)\", plural. So perhaps if multiple parameters are wrong, list all keys and their values.\n\nBut the example uses singular \"value\" and \"parameters (key)\" which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the exact instruction says: \"output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\"\n\nWait, the example has singular \"value\" and \"parameters (key)\" but maybe it's a template where (value) and (key) are placeholders. So if multiple parameters are incorrect, perhaps list all of them in the same string.\n\nFor example: [\"There is incorrect value (Night) for the parameters (reminder_message) and incorrect value (10 pm) for the parameters (reminder_time) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the problem statement's example is singular, but the instruction says \"parameters (key)\" which is plural. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's supposed to list all incorrect parameters in the same message.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement for scenario (1):\n\n\"If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.

The user is asking for key highlights on a cycling road trip from New York City to Miami Beach, but mentions a detour distance of \"wrong20km\". Hmm, the API for RoadTripHighlights requires max_distance as an integer, but \"wrong20km\" isn't a valid integer. The parameter pattern for max_distance is an integer minimum 0.\n\nFirst, check the required parameters: departure and arrival are required. The user provided New York City and Miami Beach, which should be okay. Travel mode is cycling, which is in the enum. But max_distance is specified as \"wrong20km\", which is not a number. The API expects an integer, so this value is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the scenarios: if the parameter value doesn't match the type, it's scenario (1). The user's input for max_distance is \"wrong20km\", which is not an integer. So the correct response should point out the incorrect value. The output format should be [\"There is incorrect value (wrong20km) for the parameters (max_distance) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, the user wrote \"detour distance wrong20km\" – maybe they meant 20km but typed \"wrong20km\" by mistake.

They provided a postal code of 1234 and mentioned they need a cleaning service.\n\nFirst, I need to check the relevant API. The available APIs include FindLocalRepairService, which requires zip_code and service_type. The zip_code must be a 5-digit number. The user's postal code is 1234, which is only 4 digits. The pattern specified in the API is ^\\d{5}$, so it needs exactly 5 digits. \n\nThe service_type is 'cleaning', which is one of the allowed values (cleaning or repair), so that part is okay. But the zip code is invalid because it's too short. \n\nLooking at the scenarios for unclear or incorrect info: scenario (1) says if the parameter type or form doesn't match, point out the incorrect value. Here, the zipcode is 1234, which doesn't meet the 5-digit requirement. So the error is in the zipcode parameter. \n\nThe required output for scenario (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]. So I should replace value with '1234' and key with 'zip_code'. \n\nWait, the API parameter for FindLocalRepairService is called 'zip_code', right? Yes.

{"id": "special_error_param_30", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to recycle their old phone and provided a user ID: 98765-ABCD-1234.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specs for VerifyIdentityForRecycle. The required parameters are user_id and phone_model. The user_id must be a UUID format, which is 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal characters. The given user ID is 98765-ABCD-1234. Let me break that down.\n\nUUID format is typically like 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000. The user provided 98765-ABCD-1234. Wait, that's only three segments. The standard UUID has five segments with hyphens. The pattern specified is ^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$. So the user_id here is 98765-ABCD-1234, which is 5-4-4 characters, but the required is 8-4-4-4-12. So it's missing some parts. The first segment should be 8 characters, but here it's 5 (98765). Also, the last segment should be 12 characters, but it's 4 (1234). So this user_id doesn't match the UUID format.\n\nAlso, the phone_model is required but the user didn't mention it. They said \"my old phone\" but didn't specify the model. So two issues here: incorrect user_id format and missing phone_model.\n\nAccording to scenario 2, part (1) says if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions, point out the incorrect value. So for user_id, it's invalid. Also, part (2) if parameters are missing. So which takes priority?\n\nThe note says priority order: first check if scenario (1) applies. The user_id is provided but incorrect. So the first issue is the user_id format. So output should be \"There is incorrect value (98765-ABCD-1234) for the parameters (user_id) in the conversation history.\"\n\nBut wait, also missing phone_model. However, according to the priority, (1) takes precedence over (2). So even though phone_model is missing, the user_id is invalid, so we need to address that first. The user might have made a mistake in the user_id, so correcting that is first. Once that's fixed, then we can ask for the phone model. But since the current step is t+1, the assistant should first point out the incorrect user_id.\n\nWait, but the problem is that both issues exist. However, the instructions say that if there's an incorrect value (scenario 1), output that. But the user also didn't provide phone_model. However, the priority is to check scenario (1) first. So if there's an incorrect parameter value, even if other parameters are missing, we address the incorrect one first.\n\nBut in this case, the user_id is invalid, so the assistant should report that. The phone_model is missing, but since the user_id is invalid, maybe the user needs to correct that first. However, according to the problem statement, the priority is to check if scenario (1) applies. So even if other parameters are missing, if there's an invalid parameter, we report that first.\n\nSo the correct output here is to state that the user_id value is incorrect. Let me confirm the UUID pattern. The pattern is 8-4-4-4-12. The user provided 98765-ABCD-1234. Let's count:\n\nFirst part: 98765 is 5 characters, should be 8. Second part: ABCD is 4 (correct). Third part: 1234 is 4 (correct). But wait, the UUID has five parts. The user's ID is three parts: 98765-ABCD-1234. So it's missing the fourth and fifth segments. The standard UUID is 8-4-4-4-12. So the user's input is not matching the required format. Therefore, the user_id is invalid.\n\nSo the assistant should output: [\"There is incorrect value (98765-ABCD-1234) for the parameters (user_id) in the conversation history.\"]\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (98765-ABCD-1234) for the parameters (user_id) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The available APIs are CompareWashingMachines, WashingMachinePerformanceFilter, WashingMachineComparisonTool, and BestValueWashingMachines.\n\nLooking at CompareWashingMachines, it requires a brand_list (array of strings, each 2-30 chars) and max_price (number >=100). The user provided brand names 'Wsh@123' and 'DrtyMach', and max price 300.\n\nWait, but the brand names need to be between 2-30 characters. Let's check 'Wsh@123' – that's 7 characters, which is okay. 'DrtyMach' is 8 characters. So length is fine. But the problem might be with the characters allowed. The API for CompareWashingMachines doesn't specify any regex for brand names, just minLength and maxLength. However, 'Wsh@123' contains '@' and numbers. The parameters for brand_list in CompareWashingMachines have items as type string with min and max length, but no pattern. Wait, looking back: the parameters for brand_list in CompareWashingMachines have items with type string, minLength 2, maxLength 30. There's no pattern specified here, so maybe special characters are allowed? But maybe the '@' is problematic. Wait, the API specs for brand_list under CompareWashingMachines: the description says \"Each brand name should be between 2 and 30 characters.\" It doesn't say anything about allowed characters, so maybe '@' is allowed? But in reality, brand names usually don't have such characters. However, the user provided 'Wsh@123', which might be invalid.\n\nWait, but the WashingMachineComparisonTool has a brand_pattern parameter with a regex, but that's for a different API. The CompareWashingMachines API's brand_list doesn't have a pattern, only min and max length. So maybe the '@' is allowed here. But maybe the system expects valid brand names. However, according to the API specs given, the only constraints are length. So the brand names here meet the length requirements (both are within 2-30 chars). However, the user wrote 'Wsh@123' which includes a '@' symbol. Wait, but the API specs for CompareWashingMachines don't restrict characters, only length. So maybe it's acceptable. Wait, but looking at the other APIs, for example, WashingMachinePerformanceFilter has a performance_metric with a pattern of ^[a-zA-Z\\s]+$, which requires letters and spaces. But CompareWashingMachines' brand_list doesn't have such a pattern. So perhaps the brand names can have any characters as long as they are within 2-30 length.\n\nWait, but maybe the 'Wsh@123' is a typo. The user might have intended 'Whirlpool' or something else but made a mistake. However, according to the problem statement, if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions, we need to check.\n\nWait, the API specs for CompareWashingMachines' brand_list: the items are strings with min 2, max 30. No pattern. So 'Wsh@123' is 7 characters, which is okay. But maybe the '@' is invalid for a brand name. However, the API doesn't specify that, so technically it's allowed. But perhaps in reality, brand names don't have such characters, so the user might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: if the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions. So if the API doesn't specify a pattern, then the user's input is acceptable. But in this case, the brand names include '@' and numbers. However, the API's definition for brand_list items doesn't restrict characters, only length. So the parameters as given by the user would technically meet the API's requirements. But maybe the '@' is a typo. For example, 'Wsh' might be intended as 'Whirlpool' but mistyped as 'Wsh@123'. Alternatively, the user might have entered invalid brand names.\n\nWait, the user wrote 'Wsh@123' – perhaps they meant 'Whirlpool' but typed it incorrectly. The '@' symbol is not typical in brand names. So maybe the brand names provided are invalid. But according to the API specs given, there's no restriction on characters, only length. So the assistant should check if the parameters meet the API's requirements.\n\nLooking at CompareWashingMachines' parameters:\n\nbrand_list: array of strings, each 2-30 chars. Both 'Wsh@123' (7) and 'DrtyMach' (8) are within 2-30. So they meet the length requirement. The API doesn't specify any allowed characters, so the '@' is allowed. Wait, but maybe the API expects valid brand names, but the specs don't state that. So according to the given API specs, these are acceptable.\n\nBut wait, the user's brand names might be typos. For example, 'DrtyMach' could be 'DirtyMach' but that's not a real brand. However, the problem is about validating against the API specs, not real-world validity.\n\nSo, the parameters as given by the user seem to fit CompareWashingMachines' requirements. But"}

I need to check the API specifications to see which one applies here.\n\nLooking at the APIs, there's the DataLeakPreventionTips function. It requires an email address that matches the pattern ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w{2,4}$. The user provided \"user123-somethingnew.com\" as their email. Wait, that doesn't have an '@' symbol. The email format should be something like name@domain.com. The user's input is missing the '@', which makes it invalid.\n\nSo the email parameter is required and must follow the regex pattern. The user's email is incorrect because it's missing the '@' and the domain part. For example, it should be user123@somethingnew.com. The current value \"user123-somethingnew.com\" doesn't match the pattern. \n\nAccording to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value's type or form doesn't match, we need to point out the incorrect value.

The relevant one here is MarineSpeciesDistribution. Let me look at its parameters.\n\nThe required parameter is region_identifier, which must follow the format 'REG-123'. The user provided \"AREA-123\". Wait, the pattern is ^REG-\\d{3}$, so it should start with REG-, not AREA-. That's a problem. The region_identifier is invalid because it's AREA-123 instead of REG-123.\n\nOther parameters: species_category should be fish, which is in the enum. data_source is survey, which is allowed. depth_range isn't specified by the user, but it's not required since only region_identifier is mandatory.\n\nSo the issue is with region_identifier not matching the required pattern. The user said AREA-123, but it needs to be REG-123. So this falls under scenario 2(1) where the parameter value is incorrect. The API expects a specific format, and the user's input doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct output should indicate the incorrect value for region_identifier.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (AREA-123) for the parameters (region_identifier) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The BatteryUsageAnalyzer requires 'usage_data' as a JSON string and 'analysis_depth' from the enum. The user mentioned 'incorrect format' for the data, which probably means the usage_data isn't valid JSON. The analysis_depth should be 'detailed' as per the user's request.\n\nLooking at scenario 1 and 2. Since the usage_data is specified as 'incorrect format', which doesn't match the required JSON pattern (must be a valid JSON object in a string). The API expects a JSON string starting with { and ending with }, but the user provided 'incorrect format', which likely isn't valid. So this falls under scenario 2(1) because the parameter value type is incorrect.\n\nThe required parameters are usage_data and analysis_depth. The user provided a value for usage_data that doesn't meet the pattern. So the error is in the usage_data parameter.

First, I need to check the API specifications.\n\nThe API MidAutumnFestivalHistory requires a year_range in the format 'YYYY-YYYY', which means four digits for each year. The user provided '199-2020'. Wait, 199 is only three digits. The pattern in the API is ^\\d{4}-\\d{4}$, so both years must be four digits. So '199' is invalid because it's 0199 or missing a digit? The user probably meant 1990-2020, but they wrote 199. That's a problem.\n\nThe required parameters are year_range, which is there but incorrectly formatted. The language is optional but they specified English, which is in the enum. But the year_range is invalid. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value doesn't match the type or format, we need to point out the incorrect value.\n\nSo the error is in year_range: '199-2020' instead of something like '0199-2020' or more likely '1990-2020'. The user probably missed a zero. The API expects four digits each. So the value '199' is not matching the \\d{4} pattern.

The user is asking for youth sports programs for ages 8-10 in 123Region.\n\nFirst, looking at the API specs. The required parameters are age_group and region. Age group needs to be a string matching the pattern ^\\d+-\\d+$, which the user provided as \"8-10\" – that seems correct. The region parameter must be a string with only letters and spaces, following the pattern ^[a-zA-Z\\s]+$. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"123Region\" as the region. The pattern for region requires only letters and spaces. But \"123Region\" starts with numbers, which violates the regex. The pattern is ^[a-zA-Z\\s]+$, so numbers aren't allowed. \n\nSo the region parameter is invalid because it contains digits. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value doesn't match the API's definition, I need to point out the incorrect value. The key here is 'region', and the value is '123Region'. \n\nTherefore, the correct response should be the error message about the incorrect region value.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (123Region) for the parameters (region) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The user provided \"negative five kilograms\", which is -5 kg. That's definitely below the minimum allowed.\n\nSo according to scenario 2, part (1): if the parameter type or form doesn't match, I need to point out the incorrect value. The parameter here is weight_kg, and the value is negative, which violates the minimum requirement of 0.1. \n\nTherefore, the correct response should state that there's an incorrect value for the weight_kg parameter.

Wait, 8:65 isn't a valid time because minutes can only go up to 59. So 65 is invalid. The pattern for alarm_time is ^([01]\\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\\d)$, which means the minutes part must be between 00 and 59. 65 is out of range here.\n\nSo the problem is with the alarm_time value. The user provided 8:65, which is incorrect. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter type or form doesn't match, we need to point out the incorrect value. The key here is alarm_time, and the value is 8:65.\n\nTherefore, the correct response should state that there's an incorrect value for the alarm_time parameter.

The API requires light_availability and water_frequency. The light options are low, medium, high. The user said \"constant sunlight,\" which probably means high light availability. So light_availability should be 'high'.\n\nNext, water_frequency. The options are daily, weekly, bi-weekly. The user says they water it every month. But the API doesn't have a 'monthly' option. The closest might be bi-weekly (every two weeks), but monthly is longer than bi-weekly. Wait, the API's enum for water_frequency is only daily, weekly, bi-weekly. So every month isn't one of the options. That's a problem.\n\nSo the user's water frequency is monthly, which isn't in the allowed values. According to the API specs, the water_frequency must be one of daily, weekly, or bi-weekly. Therefore, the parameter value provided by the user is incorrect. \n\nLooking at the assistant's rules, if the parameter type/form doesn't match, we need to output a message like [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nHere, the key is water_frequency, and the value given is 'every month', which isn't in the enum.

The required parameters are 'email', which is required. The user provided \"myemail@com\" as the email. Wait, but the email pattern is ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w{2,4}$. Let me check if \"myemail@com\" matches that.\n\nThe domain part here is \"com\", which is only 3 characters, but the TLD should be 2-4 characters. Wait, the pattern for email is ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w{2,4}$. So the part after the @ should have a domain and a TLD separated by a dot. The user's email is myemail@com. Wait, normally it's user@domain.tld, like example@gmail.com. Here, it's myemail@com. So the domain part here would be empty, and the TLD is \"com\". Wait, but the pattern requires [\\w\\.-]+ after the @, then a dot and \\w{2,4}. So the email should have something like \"domain.com\", but here it's just \"com\" as the entire domain part. Wait, no. Let's parse the regex: ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w{2,4}$\n\nSo after the @, it's [\\w\\.-]+ (one or more word characters, dots, hyphens) followed by a dot and then \\w{2,4}. So the email must have a domain name (like gmail) and then a TLD (like com). So the correct format would be user@domain.tld, e.g., myemail@gmail.com. The user provided myemail@com, which would be missing the domain part. Wait, no, in myemail@com, the part after @ is \"com\", which as per the regex, [\\w\\.-]+ would match \"com\", but then it needs a dot followed by \\w{2,4}. Wait, no, let's break down the regex:\n\nThe email pattern is: ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.\\w{2,4}$\n\nWait, the actual pattern in the API specs is written as '^[\\\\w\\\\.-]+@[\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.\\\\w{2,4}$'\n\nSo after the @, it's [\\\\w\\\\.-]+, which is one or more of those characters, then a literal dot (because of \\\\.), then \\\\w{2,4}.\n\nSo the structure is local-part@domain.tld\n\nIn the user's email: myemail@com\n\nHere, the domain part would be empty because after @, it's \"com\", but according to the regex, after @, we need [\\\\w\\\\.-]+ (domain name), then a dot, then tld.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the regex is [\\\\w\\\\.-]+@[\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.\\\\w{2,4}\n\nWait, the part after @ is [\\\\w\\\\.-]+, then a dot, then \\\\w{2,4}. So the domain part is [\\\\w\\\\.-]+, which is the domain name (like gmail), then a dot, then the TLD (com, org, etc.).\n\nSo the correct email should be something like user@gmail.com.\n\nBut the user wrote myemail@com. So in this case, after the @, it's \"com\", but the regex expects [\\\\w\\\\.-]+ (domain) followed by a dot and TLD. So \"com\" alone would not match because there's no dot before the TLD. Wait, no. Wait, the regex after @ is [\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.\\\\w{2,4}. So the domain part is [\\\\w\\\\.-]+, then a literal dot, then \\\\w{2,4}.\n\nSo for example, in user@gmail.com, the domain part is \"gmail\", then \".\", then \"com\".\n\nBut in the user's input, it's myemail@com. So after the @, it's \"com\", which would need to match [\\\\w\\\\.-]+\\\\.\\\\w{2,4}. But \"com\" is just three letters, no dot. So it doesn't fit the pattern. Because the regex requires that after @, there's a domain (one or more characters), a dot, and then TLD (2-4 characters).\n\nTherefore, the email \"myemail@com\" is invalid because it's missing the domain part before the TLD. The correct format would require something like myemail@example.com.\n\nSo the user's email address is invalid according to the API's regex. Therefore, the email parameter has an incorrect value.\n\nThe EmailSecurityAudit API requires the email to match that pattern, which the user's input does not.\n\nSo according to scenario 2(1), if the parameter value doesn't match the API's definition, we need to output: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nHere, the key is 'email', and the value is 'myemail@com'.\n\nSo the correct output should be: [\"There is incorrect value (myemail@com) for the parameters (email) in the conversation history.\"]\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (myemail@com) for the parameters (email) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait maybe it's supposed to list all incorrect parameters in one message.\n\nSo in this case, session_id's value \"study123\" is invalid because length is 9, which is less than 10.

So 'five' needs to be converted to 5. But the user wrote 'five', not the number 5. However, maybe the assistant should handle converting the word to a number? Wait, the API requires an integer. So the value must be an integer, not a string. So 'five' is invalid.\n\nSo two issues here: threat_type has invalid characters (numbers), and severity_level is not an integer.\n\nLooking at the scenarios for the assistant's response. For scenario 2(1): if the parameter values don't match the API definitions.\n\nFirst, check threat_type: 'malware123' fails the regex ^[a-zA-Z]+$, so it's invalid.

So both parameters have issues.\n\nBut the required parameter is only threat_type, so severity_level is optional. However, the user provided it, so if they include it, it must be valid.\n\nSo the assistant should point out both incorrect values.\n\nWait, the user said \"severity level of five\". So the value is 'five', which is not an integer. The API requires an integer between 1-10.\n\nSo according to scenario 2(1), the assistant should output: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut there are two parameters with issues. How to handle multiple incorrect parameters?\n\nThe instruction says: \"If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.\"\n\nSo for each parameter that's incorrect, list them.\n\nBut the output format example shows: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, the example uses singular, but maybe it can list multiple keys.\n\nWait, the exact instruction for (1) says: output format should be [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, maybe it's supposed to list all incorrect parameters. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe output format for (1) is: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, but the example in the problem statement might have placeholders. So perhaps for each parameter that's wrong, you list them. But the example shows (value) and (key) as placeholders.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's scenario 2(1):\n\noutput format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nSo the assistant should replace (value) with the actual incorrect value and (key) with the parameter name.\n\nBut if there are multiple parameters with issues, how to format it? The problem statement says \"the output format should be\" that string. Maybe it's a single string that lists all incorrect parameters.\n\nWait, the example in the problem statement for scenario (1) is a single string inside the brackets. So perhaps if multiple parameters are incorrect, they should all be mentioned in one string.\n\nFor example: [\"There is incorrect value (malware123) for the parameters (threat_type) and incorrect value (five) for the parameters (severity_level) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the problem statement's example uses singular \"value\" and \"parameters\". Maybe it's better to list all incorrect parameters in the same message.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should list each incorrect parameter separately, but the output format is a list with one string. Wait, the output for scenario (1) is a list containing one string. The example shows [\"There is...\"], so it's a list with a single string element.\n\nSo the assistant needs to construct a single string that lists all the incorrect parameters.\n\nIn this case, threat_type has an invalid value 'malware123' (since it contains numbers), and severity_level is 'five' which is not an integer.\n\nSo the correct response would be pointing out both parameters.\n\nThe string should be: \"There is incorrect value (malware123) for the parameters (threat_type) and incorrect value (five) for the parameters (severity_level) in the conversation history.\"\n\nBut the problem statement's example uses \"value\" and \"parameters\" in singular. Maybe it's better to say \"values\" and \"parameters\" plural.\n\nWait, the exact instruction says: \"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key)...\" which seems grammatically off. Maybe it's a typo, but the assistant should follow the exact format as specified, even if the grammar is off.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's scenario 2(1) output format: [\"There is incorrect value (value"}
{"id": "special_error_param_46", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for advice on securing their shopping account. They provided their email as 'myemail@shop@com' and want an advanced security level.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specifications for AccountSecurityAdvisor. The required parameters are account_email and security_level. The account_email has a pattern that must be a valid email format. The email given is 'myemail@shop@com' which has two @ symbols. That's not valid because emails can only have one @. The pattern for account_email is ^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$, so it should match something like user@domain.com.\n\nAlso, security_level is required and must be 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The user specified 'advanced', which is valid. So the problem here is the email format. The user's email has an extra @, making it invalid. According to scenario 2(1), if the parameter type or form doesn't match, we need to point out the incorrect value for the parameter. \n\nSo the correct output should be [\"There is incorrect value (myemail@shop@com) for the parameters (account_email) in the conversation history.\"]\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (myemail@shop@com) for the parameters (account_email) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_47", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about guidelines for using stainless steel cookware on a solar stove and for grilling.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specifications. The available API is StainlessSteelUsageGuidelines. The required parameter is heat_source, which must be one of gas, electric, or induction. The user mentioned \"solar stove\" which isn't in the enum list. The enum options are gas, electric, induction. Solar stove isn't one of them, so that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the cooking_style parameter has options frying, boiling, baking. The user said \"grilling\", which isn't in the enum. So both parameters have invalid values.\n\nAccording to the scenarios, if the parameter values don't match the API's definitions, I should point out the incorrect values. The required parameter heat_source is provided but with an invalid value (solar stove), and cooking_style is optional but grilling is invalid.\n\nThe priority is scenario (1): incorrect parameter values. So the output should state there's an incorrect value for heat_source and cooking_style.\n\nWait, the required parameter is heat_source. The user provided \"solar stove\" which isn't in the enum. So for heat_source, the value is invalid. Cooking_style is optional, but if provided, must be in enum. User said grilling, which is invalid.\n\nSo the error is for both parameters. But the API's required is only heat_source, so even if cooking_style is invalid, the main issue is heat_source's value.\n\nLooking at the output format for scenario (1): [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the user provided two parameters with incorrect values. So should it list both?\n\nThe example in the scenario says (value) and (key), but maybe it's plural. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn scenario (1), the output format is: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, the example uses singular \"value\" and \"parameters\" but maybe it's a typo. Wait, the exact instruction says:\n\noutput format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, the user's input has heat_source as 'solar stove' which is not in enum, and cooking_style as 'grilling' which is not in enum.\n\nSo the incorrect parameters are heat_source with value 'solar stove' and cooking_style with value 'grilling'.\n\nBut the API requires heat_source, so even if cooking_style is optional, providing an invalid value for it would still be an error.\n\nSo according to scenario (1), when parameter values don't match, we need to point out the incorrect ones.\n\nSo the output should list both parameters. But the format example uses singular, but maybe it's supposed to handle multiple.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut the example has \"value\" and \"key\" in singular. However, in this case, there are two parameters with incorrect values, so perhaps the message should list both.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"if the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details.\"\n\nSo in this case, both heat_source and cooking_style have invalid values. So the correct output would mention both.\n\nBut how to phrase it. The example format uses singular, but maybe it's a template where (value) and (key) can be plural.\n\nWait, looking at the exact instruction for scenario (1):\n\noutput format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo and should be \"values\" and \"parameter\". But according to the problem statement, it's written as \"value\" and \"parameters\".\n\nHmm. Maybe the intended format allows listing multiple. So for this case, the incorrect values are 'solar stove' for heat_source and 'grilling' for cooking_style.\n\nSo the message should be: \"There is incorrect value (solar stove) for the parameters (heat_source) and incorrect value (grilling) for the parameters (cooking_style) in the conversation history.\"\n\nBut the problem says the output format is exactly as specified. Wait, the problem says:\n\noutput format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nSo perhaps each incorrect parameter should be listed separately, but the example shows a single string. Wait, but the problem says \"output format should be\" that exact string with placeholders.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to list all incorrect parameters in the same message.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement for scenario (1):\n\n\"If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match the API's definitions, ask in-depth questions to clarify and correct the details. The output format should be: [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nSo the key here is that the user provided the key details (i.e., they mentioned heat_source and cooking_style) but the values are invalid.\n\nSo the assistant should point out which parameters have incorrect values.\n\nIn this case, heat_source is required, and the value 'solar stove' is not in the enum. cooking_style is provided but 'grilling' is not in the enum.\n\nThus, the correct output would be a message stating that for heat_source, the value 'solar stove' is incorrect, and for cooking_style, 'grilling' is"}
{"id": "special_error_param_48", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to check the system health every 10 minutes and send alerts to myemail#domain.com.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the API specs for Monitor_System_Health. The required parameters are check_interval, alert_email, and system_id. The user provided check_interval as 10 minutes, which is within the 5-60 range. Good.\n\nBut the alert_email is given as myemail#domain.com. Wait, the API requires the email to be in a valid format. The format should be an email, which typically has an @ symbol. Here, the user used a # instead of @, so it's invalid. That's a problem.\n\nAlso, the user didn't mention the system_id. The API says system_id is required, a string of alphanumeric characters. The user didn't provide it, so that's missing.\n\nSo two issues here: incorrect email format and missing system_id. According to the priority, first check if there's incorrect parameter values. The email is incorrect, so scenario (1) applies. Then, after addressing that, there's also a missing parameter.\n\nWait, the problem says if scenario (1) applies (incorrect value), output that. But there's also a missing parameter. However, the priority is first check for incorrect values. So the main issue here is the email format. But the user also didn't provide system_id. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's message says \"send alerts to myemail#domain.com\". The email is invalid because of the #. So the alert_email parameter has an incorrect value. So according to (1), output [\"There is incorrect value (myemail#domain.com) for the parameters (alert_email) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nBut also, system_id is missing. However, the priority order says first check if (1) applies. Since there's an incorrect value, we need to address that first. But the user might have multiple issues. However, according to the instructions, if (1) applies, output that even if there are missing parameters. Wait, let me check the strategy again.\n\nThe strategy says: (1) If the user's instructions include the key details required to call the API, but the type or form of the parameter values does not match... ask to clarify. (2) If lacking key details, ask for missing info.\n\nIn this case, the user provided alert_email but in wrong format (so (1) applies), and didn't provide system_id (so (2) also applies). But the priority is first check (1). Wait, but the problem says steps have priority order. First determine if (1) applies. If it does, output according to (1). So even if there are missing parameters, if there's an incorrect value, we have to point that out first.\n\nWait, the user provided alert_email but with wrong format, so (1) applies. The system_id is missing, which is (2). But according to the note: \"the above steps have a priority order. You need to first determine whether scenario (1) applies. If it does, output according to the requirements in (1).\"\n\nSo even though there's a missing parameter, since there's an incorrect value, we have to output the error for the incorrect value first. Because (1) has higher priority than (2).\n\nSo the main issue here is the email format. The user used # instead of @, so the alert_email is invalid. Therefore, the correct output should be pointing out the incorrect value for alert_email.\n\nWait, but the user might have both issues. However, per the instructions, we need to check (1) first. So even if there's a missing parameter, if there's an incorrect value, we address that first.\n\nSo the answer should be [\"There is incorrect value (myemail#domain.com) for the parameters (alert_email) in the conversation history.\"]\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (myemail#domain.com) for the parameters (alert_email) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_49", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking to set the air quality adjustment threshold to 700 for device 12345678.\n\nFirst, I need to check which API can handle this. Looking at the API specs, the SmartACFilterAdjustment function seems relevant. It requires device_id, aqi_threshold, and adjustment_level (though the latter isn't required).\n\nThe device_id here is 12345678. The pattern for device_id is ^[A-Z0-9]{8}$, which matches an 8-character alphanumeric string. 12345678 is 8 digits, so that's okay.\n\nThe aqi_threshold is given as 700. But the API specifies that aqi_threshold must be between 0 and 500. 700 exceeds the maximum allowed value of 500. So there's an issue here.\n\nSince the parameter value is outside the allowed range, this falls under scenario (1) where the value is incorrect. The user provided a value (700) for the parameter (aqi_threshold) that doesn't meet the API's constraints.\n\nSo I need to output an error message pointing out the incorrect value. The required format is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nPlugging in the values: value is 700, key is aqi_threshold.\n\nTherefore, the correct output should be the string indicating the incorrect value for aqi_threshold.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (700) for the parameters (aqi_threshold) in the conversation history.\"]"}
