The required fields are chargingStationId, vehicleId, chargingProfile, and location. \n\nThe chargingProfile requires startTime, duration, powerLevel, and chargingType. The user mentioned \"high power level,\" so I need to figure out what that translates to. The powerLevel parameter has a minimum of 3.5 and maximum of 22.0 kW. High power level might be the upper end, maybe 22.0 kW. Also, chargingType has enum values 'inductive' or 'resonant'. The API description says it uses inductive charging technology, so probably 'inductive'.\n\nThe startTime is 'immediate' as per user input. Duration is 4 hours. Location is given with latitude and longitude. \n\nSo, the parameters would be:\n- chargingStationId: CS12345\n- vehicleId: EV2023\n- chargingProfile: \n  - startTime: immediate\n  - duration: 4\n  - powerLevel: 22.0 (assuming high means max)\n  - chargingType: inductive\n- location:\n  - latitude: 37.7749\n  - longitude: -122.4194\n\nCheck if all required parameters are included.

Wait, no, required is just updateSchedule. Let me check again.\n\nThe IDSManager_updateSignatures parameters: required is ['updateSchedule']. The updateSchedule has type and time. The type is enum daily, weekly, monthly. The user said daily. Time is 02:00 AM, which in 24-hour format is 02:00. The pattern is ^([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$, so 02:00 is valid.\n\nAlso, signatureOptions has autoUpdate as a required boolean. The user said \"yes, I want them to be automatic,\" so autoUpdate should be true. The customSignatures is optional, but the user didn't mention any, so we can omit that.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nupdateSchedule: { type: 'daily', time: '02:00' }\n\nsignatureOptions: { autoUpdate: true }\n\nSince the required parameters for the API are updateSchedule, but signatureOptions is part of the parameters, but the required field for the API is only updateSchedule. Wait, looking at the API spec:\n\n\"required\": [\"updateSchedule\"]\n\nBut signatureOptions is under properties, so it's optional? Wait, no. The parameters for IDSManager_updateSignatures have \"required\": [\"updateSchedule\"], which means updateSchedule is required, but signatureOptions is optional. However, in the signatureOptions, autoUpdate is required (since in signatureOptions' properties, required is ['autoUpdate']). Wait, the signatureOptions object has required ['autoUpdate'], so if we include signatureOptions, we must have autoUpdate. But the API's main required is only updateSchedule. However, the user specified that updates should be automatic, so we need to include signatureOptions with autoUpdate: true.\n\nSo the API call should include both updateSchedule and signatureOptions.\n\nSo parameters:\n\nupdateSchedule: { type: 'daily', time: '02:00' }\n\nsignatureOptions: { autoUpdate: true }\n\nTherefore, the API call would be IDSManager_updateSignatures with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n[IDSManager_updateSignatures(updateSchedule={'type': 'daily', 'time': '02:00'}, signatureOptions={'autoUpdate': True})]"}

The user mentioned reclining to 30%, which should be the tilt angle. The current tilt isn't specified, but the user wants to change it to 30%. \n\nIn the previous call, the seat_position had horizontal 70 and vertical 40. Now, they only mention reclining to 30%, so tilt should be 30. The horizontal and vertical might stay the same unless specified, but the user didn't mention changing those, so maybe they want to keep horizontal at 70 and vertical at 40, and adjust tilt to 30. \n\nWait, the user said \"recline the seat a bit more to 30%\", so recline is the tilt. The tilt parameter goes from 0 (upright) to 100 (reclined). So 30% reclined would be tilt=30. \n\nThe required parameters for seat_position are horizontal and vertical, which were set before. But in this new request, the user isn't changing horizontal or vertical, just tilt. However, the API's seat_position requires horizontal and vertical as required fields. So even if they aren't changing, we need to include them. But how? The user didn't specify new values for horizontal and vertical, so maybe we should keep the previous values (70 and 40) and add the new tilt.\n\nWait, in the previous system response, the seat was adjusted to 70% forward (horizontal) and 40% height (vertical). Now the user is only changing the tilt. So for the new request, horizontal remains 70, vertical remains 40, and tilt is set to 30.\n\nThe locking_mechanism status should still be engaged, as the user probably wants the lock to stay engaged after adjustment. The previous call had status \"engaged\", so unless the user says otherwise, we should keep that.\n\nThe adjustment_time parameter is optional, but the user didn't mention speed, so maybe omit it. The required parameters for adjust_seat_safety are seat_position (which needs horizontal and vertical) and locking_mechanism (which needs status). So even though the user is only changing tilt, we have to include horizontal and vertical again with their current values.\n\nSo the new API call should have seat_position with horizontal=70, vertical=40, tilt=30. Locking_mechanism status=engaged.\n\nCheck if tilt is part of seat_position. Yes, in the API specs, seat_position has horizontal, vertical, tilt. But horizontal and vertical are required, tilt is optional. Wait, the required fields for seat_position are horizontal and vertical. Tilt is not required. So in the first call, they didn't include tilt. Now the user wants to adjust tilt, so we need to include tilt in the seat_position.\n\nBut the required parameters for the API are seat_position (which requires horizontal and vertical) and locking_mechanism (which requires status). So even when adjusting tilt, we still need to provide horizontal and vertical. Since the user didn't specify new horizontal/vertical, we use the previous values.\n\nTherefore, the API call should be adjust_seat_safety with seat_position: horizontal=70, vertical=40, tilt=30; locking_mechanism: status=engaged.\n\nCheck the parameters again. The user said \"recline the seat a bit more to 30%\". Recline is tilt, so tilt=30. The previous tilt wasn't set, but now it's being set to 30.

The user specified SAP and daily.\n\nWait, the previous system response already called the API with meetingID, participantID, and joinTime. But now the user is adding more info about HR integration.

Wait, the hrIntegration object's required field is ['hrSystem'], so reportingFrequency is optional. But the user said \"daily reporting\", so we should include reportingFrequency as 'daily'.\n\nSo the parameters for the API call would be:\n\nmeetingID: \"M123456\"\n\nparticipant: {\n  participantID: \"John Doe\",\n  joinTime: \"2024-04-04T10:00:00\"\n}\n\nhrIntegration: {\n  hrSystem: \"SAP\",\n  reportingFrequency: \"daily\"\n}\n\nWait, but does the API allow updating existing records? The description says \"Registers and tracks participant attendance\", so maybe each call is a registration event. But in this case, the user first registered the participant, then added HR integration details. So perhaps the correct way is to include all necessary parameters in a single call, but since the initial call didn't have hrIntegration, now we need to make another call with the same participant and meetingID but adding hrIntegration.\n\nBut the API might be designed to update the record when called again. So the assistant should generate a new API call with all the parameters, including the hrIntegration part.\n\nSo the correct API request would have meetingID, participant (with participantID and joinTime), and hrIntegration (hrSystem and reportingFrequency).\n\nTherefore, the parameters are meetingID=\"M123456\", participant={\"participantID\": \"John Doe\", \"joinTime\": \"2024-04-04T10:00:00\"}, hrIntegration={\"hrSystem\": \"SAP\", \"reportingFrequency\": \"daily\"}.\n\nWait, but the participant's leaveTime is optional, but in this case, the user hasn't mentioned leaveTime, so it's not included.

Wait, but the conversation history shows that the first request was made on 2023-05-24, and now the user is asking to change the suffix. However, the problem is that in the current step, the assistant needs to generate the API call based on the user's latest input.\n\nWait, the user says \"Please change the suffix to 'Knight' instead.\" So they want to update the existing alias. The parameters required for security_generate_alias are format (which requires type, and if type is prefix-suffix, then prefix and suffix) and time_constraint (start_time and end_time). The user hasn't mentioned changing the time, so we should reuse the previous time_constraint values. But in the conversation history, the system used start_time \"2023-05-24T08:00:00\" and end_time \"2023-06-30T23:59:59\". However, the user's original request said \"starting today till next month's end\". If today is 2023-05-24, then next month's end is June 30. But if the current date when the user is making the change is later, but the user didn't specify new dates, so we should assume the same time period as before.\n\nWait, but the problem is that in the current step, the assistant doesn't have access to the actual current date, only the conversation history. The previous system response used those specific dates, so when the user says to change the suffix, the time_constraint should remain the same as in the previous call. Therefore, the new call should have format with type \"prefix-suffix\", prefix \"Mystic\", suffix \"Knight\", and the same time_constraint as before.\n\nSo the API call would be security_generate_alias with format={\"type\": \"prefix-suffix\", \"prefix\": \"Mystic\", \"suffix\": \"Knight\"}, time_constraint={\"start_time\": \"2023-05-24T08:00:00\", \"end_time\": \"2023-06-30T23:59:59\"}.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the time_constraint again, but in the API parameters, time_constraint is required (since the required array for the security_generate_alias API includes 'format', but looking back at the API specs:\n\nLooking at the security_generate_alias API:\n\n'required': ['format'] â€” the time_constraint is not in the required list. Wait, let me check.\n\nThe API specs for security_generate_alias:\n\nparameters: {\n  'type': 'object',\n  'properties': {\n    'format': { ... },\n    'time_constraint': { ... }\n  },\n  'required': ['format']\n}\n\nSo the required parameters are only 'format'. The time_constraint is optional. However, in the user's first request, they specified \"starting today till next month's end\", so time_constraint was included. Now, the user is only changing the suffix, so they probably want to keep the same time period. But since time_constraint is optional, if the user doesn't mention it, should we include it? Wait, but in the first call, the user did specify the time period, so the system used it. Now, when the user says \"change the suffix\", they likely intend to keep the same time period. However, the API requires that if time_constraint is provided, it must have start_time and end_time. But since the user didn't mention changing the time, but the previous call had time_constraint, the assistant should include the same time_constraint as before to maintain the validity period.\n\nBut how does the assistant know the previous time_constraint values? From the conversation history. In the system's previous response, the API call included time_constraint with those specific dates. So the assistant, in step t+1, should reuse those dates for the time_constraint.\n\nTherefore, the correct API call is to use the same start_time and end_time as before, but change the suffix to 'Knight'.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\nformat: {\n  type: 'prefix-suffix',\n  prefix: 'Mystic',\n  suffix: 'Knight'\n},\ntime_constraint: {\n  start_time: '2023-05-24T08:00:00',\n  end_time: '2023-06-30T23:59:59'\n}\n\nThus, the API"}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to set up automated testing for their new management system. They mentioned scheduling tests daily at 6:00 AM. From the conversation history, the user provided the project ID (123abc), repository URL (https://github.com/example/project), and the testing framework (Jest).\n\nLooking at the API specifications for test_management_tool, the required parameters are project_settings (which needs project_id and optionally repository_url) and test_config (needs framework and optionally coverage_threshold). The schedule object requires time and frequency. The user specified daily at 6:00 AM, so time should be '06:00' and frequency 'daily'.\n\nThe user didn't mention coverage_threshold, so that's optional and can be omitted. All required fields are covered: project_id is provided, framework is Jest, schedule time and frequency are set. So the API call should include project_settings with project_id and repository_url, test_config with framework, and schedule with time and frequency.\n</think>\n\n[test_management_tool(project_settings={'project_id': '123abc', 'repository_url': 'https://github.com/example/project'}, test_config={'framework': 'Jest'}, schedule={'time': '06:00', 'frequency': 'daily'})]"}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_16", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me figure out how to approach this. The user wants to introduce a new quiz feature in their educational game and schedule it to start next session. Wait, but in the conversation history, the user initially said \"schedule it to start next session,\" but then when the system asked for details, the user said \"activation should be immediate.\" Hmm, there's a possible contradiction here.\n\nWait, looking back: The user's first message says they want the feature to start next session. Then the system asks for activation time as immediate, next-session, or specific time. The user responds with \"activation should be immediate.\" So maybe there's a mistake here. The user wanted it for next session but said immediate. But I have to go by what the user said in the last message.\n\nThe API parameter for activationTime has enum values: 'immediate', 'next-session', 'specific-time'. The user said \"activation should be immediate.\" So even though their initial request was for next session, the latest input specifies immediate. Maybe they corrected themselves.\n\nSo, the required parameters for GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature are gameId, featureType, and triggerEvent. The featureConfig requires featureType and triggerEvent. The user provided gameId 129632, triggerEvent as 'level-up', featureType as 'quiz', and activationTime as 'immediate'.\n\nWait, the activationTime is part of featureConfig. The user said activation should be immediate, so activationTime is 'immediate'. The enum for activationTime includes 'immediate', so that's valid.\n\nSo, the API call should be GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature with gameId='129632', featureConfig having featureType='quiz', triggerEvent='level-up', activationTime='immediate'.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"schedule it to start next session\" initially, but then in the response, they said activation should be immediate. Maybe they changed their mind. But according to the conversation history step t, the user's last message says \"activation should be immediate.\" So the correct parameter is 'immediate'.\n\nSo, the parameters are:\n\ngameId: '129632'\n\nfeatureConfig: {\n  featureType: 'quiz',\n  triggerEvent: 'level-up',\n  activationTime: 'immediate'\n}\n\nAll required parameters are present: gameId, featureType, triggerEvent. activationTime is optional? Wait, looking at the API spec for GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature:\n\nIn the parameters, under featureConfig, the required fields are ['featureType', 'triggerEvent']. activationTime is not in the required list, but the user provided it, so we should include it.\n\nWait, the API spec says for featureConfig:\n\n'required': ['featureType', 'triggerEvent']\n\nSo activationTime is optional. But the user specified it, so we include it.\n\nTherefore, the API call should have all three: featureType, triggerEvent, activationTime.\n\nSo the correct API request is GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature with gameId='129632', featureConfig={'featureType': 'quiz', 'triggerEvent': 'level-up', 'activationTime': 'immediate'}.\n\nI need to check if the enum values are correct. featureType enum includes 'quiz', yes. triggerEvent enum has 'level-up', yes. activationTime enum has 'immediate', yes.\n\nSo the output should be [GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature(gameId='129632', featureConfig={'featureType': 'quiz', 'triggerEvent': 'level-up', 'activationTime': 'immediate'})]\n\nWait, but in the format specified, the parameters should be key1='value1', etc. However, featureConfig is an object. How to represent that in the API call string?\n\nLooking at the example in the instructions: [ApiName(key1='value1', key2='value2', ...)]\n\nBut for nested objects, like featureConfig, how is it formatted? The example given in the problem statement doesn't have nested objects, but the instruction says to replace key1, key2 with actual parameter names and values.\n\nWait, the parameters for GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature are gameId (string) and featureConfig (object). So in the API call, featureConfig should be a dictionary. But in the output format specified, how to represent that?\n\nThe problem says: \"replacing ApiName with the actual API name, key1, key2, etc., with the actual parameter names, and value1, value2, etc., with the actual parameter values.\"\n\nSo for example, if a parameter is an object, it should be represented as a dictionary string. But the example given in the problem statement for multiple API calls uses commas between parameters, but for nested objects, maybe it's written as featureConfig={'featureType': 'quiz', ...}.\n\nWait, looking at the API specifications, the parameters for GameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature have featureConfig as an object with properties. So in the API call, the value for featureConfig should be a JSON object. However, the output format required is a string representation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output should start with a square bracket '[' and end with a square bracket ']'.\" And the example is [ApiName(key1='value1', key2='value2', ...)]\n\nSo in this case, the parameters are gameId and featureConfig. So the API call would be:\n\nGameFeatureScheduler_scheduleInteractiveFeature(gameId='129632', featureConfig={'featureType': 'quiz', 'triggerEvent': 'level-up', 'activationTime': 'immediate'})\n\nBut how to format the featureConfig as a string.

The user provided both: artist is Taylor Swift, genre is pop. \n\nThen there's the releasePeriod, which requires startYear and endYear. The user mentioned between 2015 and 2020, so startYear should be 2015 and endYear 2020. \n\nOther parameters like trackFeatures are optional, but the user didn't mention any specific features, so I can skip those. \n\nSo the API call should include artist='Taylor Swift', genre='pop', releasePeriod with startYear=2015 and endYear=2020.\n\nWait, the parameters for releasePeriod are part of an object. So in the API request, it should be structured as releasePeriod={'startYear': 2015, 'endYear': 2020}.\n\nLet me make sure all required parameters are included. The required are artist and genre, which are provided. ReleasePeriod is required as part of the parameters since it's listed under required for the API? Wait, looking back at the API specs for MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks:\n\nThe required fields are ['artist', 'genre'], but releasePeriod has its own required fields ['startYear', 'endYear']. However, the API's main required parameters are artist and genre, but releasePeriod is a parameter that's part of the object, but is releasePeriod itself required? Let me check.\n\nIn the MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks parameters, the required list is ['artist', 'genre']. The releasePeriod is a parameter under properties, but it's not in the required list. Wait, no, looking at the structure:\n\nThe parameters for MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks have a 'required' field which is ['artist', 'genre']. So releasePeriod is optional? Wait, no. Wait, the 'required' array under the main parameters specifies which top-level parameters are required. So artist and genre are required, but releasePeriod is optional. However, the user specified the release period (2015-2020), so we need to include it.\n\nWait, but in the user's message, they said \"released between 2015 and 2020\", so we have to include releasePeriod with startYear and endYear. But according to the API specs, releasePeriod is part of the parameters, and within releasePeriod, startYear and endYear are required. So even though releasePeriod itself isn't a required top-level parameter, since the user provided that info, we need to include it.\n\nSo the API call will have artist='Taylor Swift', genre='pop', and releasePeriod with startYear=2015, endYear=2020.\n\nLet me check the parameter types. artist is a string, which Taylor Swift is. Genre is a string, 'pop'. ReleasePeriod is an object with startYear and endYear as integers.\n\nYes, 2015 and 2020 are within the allowed range (1900-2023).

The conversation history shows that the user initially wanted to add background music to their presentation with specific settings: the music file at \"https://example.com/music.mp3\", volume 75%, starting at 01:00, and ending at the end. The system called the presentation_add_background_music API with those parameters, and it was successful.\n\nNow the user says, \"Actually, let's loop the music as well.\" So they want to modify the existing setup to include looping. The original API call didn't have the loop parameter set; looking at the API specs, the loop parameter is a boolean with a default of False. So the user is now requesting to enable looping.\n\nI need to check the API parameters again. The presentation_add_background_music API requires music_file and settings, and within settings, volume is required. The user is keeping the same music file, so music_file remains \"https://example.com/music.mp3\". The volume was 75%, start_time 01:00, end_time \"end\", and now loop should be True.\n\nWait, the previous call already set volume, start_time, and end_time. Now the user is adding loop. So the new settings should include loop=True, along with the existing parameters. The system needs to update the settings to include loop.\n\nThe API parameters for settings require 'volume', which is still 75. The other parameters like start_time and end_time were specified before and the user hasn't changed them, so they should remain as 01:00 and \"end\". But the user didn't mention changing those, so we should retain them. However, the user's current message only mentions adding loop. But since the API call needs all required parameters, and volume is required, we have to include it again. Also, the previous settings had start_time and end_time, but the API doesn't require them (only volume is required in settings). Wait, looking back at the API spec:\n\nIn the presentation_add_background_music API, under settings, the required field is ['volume']. So start_time and end_time are optional. However, the user initially specified them, and now they want to add loop. So in the new API call, we need to include music_file, settings with volume (required), loop (now set to True), and probably keep the existing start_time and end_time since the user didn't say to change them.\n\nWait, but the user's current request is only to loop the music. So the other parameters (volume, start_time, end_time) should remain as they were in the previous call. However, when making the API call, do we need to resend all the parameters or just the ones that are changing?\n\nThe API is for adding background music. If this is an update to the existing presentation's music settings, does the API replace the previous settings or update them? The description says \"Add background music to a presentation with customizable options...\" which suggests that each call might be setting the parameters, so to modify, you have to resend all parameters with the updated ones.\n\nIn the previous step, the system called the API with music_file, settings including volume 75, start_time 01:00, end_time \"end\". Now the user wants to loop, so the new call should include the same music_file, same volume, start_time, end_time, but loop=True.\n\nTherefore, the correct API call should have music_file=\"https://example.com/music.mp3\", settings={\"volume\":75, \"start_time\":\"01:00\", \"end_time\":\"end\", \"loop\":True}.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention changing volume, start_time, or end_time, so those should stay as they were. The previous settings had volume 75, start_time 01:00, end_time \"end\". The only new parameter is loop=True.\n\nSo the assistant should generate the API call with all the previous parameters plus loop=True.\n\nTherefore, the parameters would be:\n\nmusic_file: \"https://example.com/music.mp3\"\n\nsettings: {\n  \"volume\": 75,\n  \"start_time\": \"01:00\",\n  \"end_time\": \"end\",\n  \"loop\": True\n}\n\nBut wait, the required parameter in settings is only 'volume', so the others are optional. However, since the user wants to keep the previous settings except adding loop, we need to include all the previously set optional parameters (start_time, end_time) along with the new loop parameter.\n\nYes, because if you don't include start_time and end_time in the new call, the API might reset them to default or omit them, which the user doesn't want. Since the user said \"Actually, let's loop the music as well,\" they want to keep the existing settings and just add looping.\n\nTherefore, the correct API request should include all the previous parameters plus loop=True.\n\nSo the API call would be presentation_add_background_music with music_file set to the same URL, settings including volume=75, start_time='01:00', end_time='end', loop=True.\n\nChecking the enum for end_time: 'end' is allowed as per the enum ['end', '00:30', ...], so that's correct.\n\nAlso, loop is a boolean, so True should be passed as a boolean, but in the output format, it's represented as 'True' in the string? Wait, the output should have the parameters as key='value', but for boolean values, in Python syntax it's usually without quotes, but the instruction says to replace with actual parameter values.

The API's eventTypes parameter is optional, but since the user wants all major events, including the event types might be necessary. However, the API's required parameters are only caseId and timeRange. So maybe eventTypes is optional, and if not provided, the API defaults to all. But since the user specified \"all major events\", which correspond to the enum values, it's safer to include all event types in the request.\n\nWait, the enum for eventTypes is ['Filing', 'Hearing', 'Judgment', 'Settlement']. So including all four would cover the major events. The user said \"covering all the major events\", so we should specify eventTypes as all four.\n\nSo the parameters would be:\n\ncaseId: '58794X'\n\ntimeRange: {startDate: '2021-01-01', endDate: '2023-03-31'}\n\neventTypes: ['Filing', 'Hearing', 'Judgment', 'Settlement']\n\nBut wait, the user said \"started in January 2021\" which could be any day in January, but the API requires a specific date. Since the user didn't specify the exact start date, but the API requires startDate and endDate in date format, the assistant should use the first day of the month for start and last day for end. So January 2021 is 2021-01-01, and March 2023 is 2023-03-31.\n\nTherefore, the API call should be CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n[CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline(caseId='58794X', timeRange={'startDate': '2021-01-01', 'endDate': '2023-03-31'}, eventTypes=['Filing', 'Hearing', 'Judgment', 'Settlement'])]"}

Time period is from 2018 to 2022, so startYear 2018 and endYear 2022. In the details, they want includeAmounts to be true (since they want financial amounts), currency USD, frequencyAnalysis should be false (as they don't want the analysis), and analysisDepth isn't mentioned so maybe it's optional. Wait, the details section requires includeAmounts and frequencyAnalysis. The user says to include amounts in USD but not frequency analysis. So includeAmounts is true, currency is USD, frequencyAnalysis is false. AnalysisDepth is part of details but the user didn't specify, so maybe it's optional. The parameters say details requires includeAmounts and frequencyAnalysis, so those must be set. The other parameters in details like currency and analysisDepth are optional but the user mentioned currency as USD, so we should include that.\n\nSo the API call should have propertyId='P12345', timePeriod with startYear=2018, endYear=2022, details include includeAmounts=True, currency='USD', frequencyAnalysis=False.

The current noise is 30 dB, light is 300 lumens, and it's late night. So I need to use the SleepOptimizer_configureSleepEnvironment API. The parameters required are userPreferences (preferredSound and lightLevel) and environmentalData (currentNoiseLevel, currentLightLevel, timeOfDay). The user provided all these values, so I can fill those in.\n\nNext, the yoga session: they want Vinyasa style, available from 9 AM to 10 AM tomorrow. The date is May 8, 2022, Sunday. Tomorrow would be May 9, which is Monday. So the sessionTiming should be startDate as 2022-05-09T09:00:00 and endDate as 2022-05-09T10:00:00.

Wait, the API's required fields for userPreferences are ['yogaStyle'], so instructorPreference is optional except for 'name' being required if included. Since the user didn't specify an instructor, maybe we don't include instructorPreference at all. Wait, the userPreferences object has required ['yogaStyle'], so as long as yogaStyle is present, other fields are optional. So in this case, since the user only specified yogaStyle and no instructor, we can omit instructorPreference. Wait, looking at the API specs: userPreferences has properties including yogaStyle (required) and instructorPreference (which is an object with required 'name'). But since the user didn't mention an instructor, maybe we don't include instructorPreference. Wait, the required fields for userPreferences are ['yogaStyle'], so as long as yogaStyle is there, the rest of userPreferences can be just that. So the userPreferences would be {\"yogaStyle\": \"Vinyasa\"}.\n\nWait, checking the API specification for MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream:\n\nuserPreferences is an object with required ['yogaStyle'], and instructorPreference is a property under userPreferences. But instructorPreference itself has required ['name']. However, if the user didn't specify an instructor, maybe we don't include instructorPreference at all. So userPreferences would just have yogaStyle.\n\nSo for the yoga session, parameters would be:\n\nuserPreferences: {\"yogaStyle\": \"Vinyasa\"}\n\nsessionTiming: {\"startDate\": \"2022-05-09T09:00:00\", \"endDate\": \"2022-05-09T10:00:00\"}\n\nWait, the current date is May 08, 2022, Sunday.

So the startDate and endDate would be 2022-05-09T09:00:00 and 2022-05-09T10:00:00.\n\nSo the two API calls needed are SleepOptimizer_configureSleepEnvironment and MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream.\n\nLet me check if there are any other APIs that might be relevant.

However, since the current time is November 24, 2020, the end date for this week's request can't be in the future.

However, the user is asking for two separate weeks. Wait, the user's initial request was \"from last week and also from this week\". The system asked for specific dates, and the user provided two date ranges. So the assistant needs to make two separate API requests, each with their respective date ranges.\n\nWait, but looking at the API specs, the technews_fetch_latest_ai_developments API has a date_range parameter which is an object with start_date and end_date. So each API call covers one date range. Therefore, to get both weeks, we need two separate API calls.\n\nBut the user's latest message specifies two date ranges.

The user is asking for the addresses of two historical European sites: the Eiffel Tower on December 31st, 1888, and the Colosseum on August 1st, 100 AD.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the coordinates for these places. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so latitude and longitude should be around 48.8584 and 2.2945. The Colosseum in Rome is approximately 41.8902 and 12.4922. \n\nWait, but the user didn't provide coordinates, so I should check if the API can handle place names. Wait, no, the API here is TimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress, which requires location as latitude and longitude. So maybe the user expects me to know the coordinates of these landmarks. But since the user didn't specify, but in the previous example, they provided coordinates. Wait, the previous user query had coordinates for LA, but now they're asking about Eiffel Tower and Colosseum without coordinates. Hmm.\n\nWait, the API requires location with lat and lng. So the assistant must have to use the known coordinates for these landmarks. But how does the assistant get those coordinates? Wait, in the problem setup, the assistant is supposed to generate the API requests based on the conversation history. The user didn't provide coordinates here, but maybe the assistant is expected to know or assume standard coordinates for these landmarks.\n\nWait, looking back at the previous example: when the user provided coordinates, the system called the API with those coordinates. Now the user is mentioning the Eiffel Tower and Colosseum by name, not coordinates. But the API requires coordinates. So there's a problem here. Wait, but maybe in the context of the problem, the assistant is supposed to know the coordinates for these famous landmarks. So for the Eiffel Tower, standard coordinates are 48.8584Â° N, 2.2945Â° E. For the Colosseum, 41.8902Â° N, 12.4922Â° E.\n\nSo the assistant needs to use those coordinates. Then, for each site, call the API with the specific date and timeFrame. For the Eiffel Tower on 1888-12-31, timeFrame should be Past. For the Colosseum on 100 AD, which is historical, also Past. Wait, but 100 AD is way in the past, so timeFrame is Past.\n\nWait, the dateContext has specificDate as a string in date format. So for Eiffel Tower: specificDate \"1888-12-31\", timeFrame \"Past\". For Colosseum: specificDate \"0100-08-01\" (but AD 100 is year 100, so in ISO format it's 0100-08-01? Wait, ISO dates usually don't have leading zeros for years, but maybe the API expects four digits. So 0100 for year 100 AD. But sometimes, years before 1000 are written with leading zeros. However, the standard for ISO 8601 is to use at least four digits, so 0100 for year 100.\n\nWait, but 100 AD is year 100, so in ISO format, it's 0100-08-01. But some systems might just use \"100-08-01\", but the problem says the format is 'date', which is typically YYYY-MM-DD. So leading zeros to make four digits for the year. So 0100-08-01.\n\nSo the two API calls would be:\n\nFirst, Eiffel Tower coordinates (48.8584, 2.2945) with date 1888-12-31, timeFrame Past.\n\nSecond, Colosseum coordinates (41.8902, 12.4922) with date 0100-08-01, timeFrame Past.\n\nWait, but the user said \"August 1st, 100 AD\", so 100 AD is year 100, so specificDate would be \"0100-08-01\".\n\nBut need to check if the API's specificDate parameter accepts years with leading zeros. The description says format is 'date', which in JSON schema usually refers to ISO 8601, which requires four-digit years. So 0100 is correct for year 100.\n\nSo the assistant should generate two API calls with these parameters.\n\nNow, checking the required parameters: location is required (lat and lng). dateContext is not required in the API's required list, but the user is specifying dates, so dateContext should be included. For dateContext, specificDate and timeFrame are parameters. The timeFrame enum includes Past, Present, Future. Since both dates are in the past (1888 and 100 AD), timeFrame should be \"Past\" for both.\n\nSo the two API requests would be:\n\nTimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress(location={\"lat\": 48.8584, \"lng\": 2.2945}, dateContext={\"specificDate\": \"1888-12-31\", \"timeFrame\": \"Past\"})\n\nand\n\nTimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress(location={\"lat"}

The user mentioned two separate date ranges, so I need to make two separate API calls. Each call should have the venue_id and one date_range.\n\nThe API requires each date_range to have start_date and end_date. The user provided both ranges, so for the first request, date_range is start_date='2023-06-01' and end_date='2023-06-03'. The second request would be start_date='2023-07-10' and end_date='2023-07-12'. \n\nOther parameters like time_slots and maintenance_schedule are optional.

Treatment details are optional since the user said they don't need them.\n\nSo for each patient ID, I need to call the API with their ID, the start and end dates. Since there are four patients, that means four separate API calls. The hospitalization period is the same for all, so each call will have the same start and end dates. The treatment_details array is optional, and the user said they don't need it, so we can omit that parameter.\n\nWait, the API requires hospitalization_period with start_date and end_date as required. So each call must include those dates.

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_43", "result": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for durability and maintenance info for three water samplers: WS100, WS101, WS102. They mentioned using a quarterly maintenance schedule starting from today, May 24, 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specs. The API is water_quality_get_sampler_durability. Required parameter is sampler_id. There's also maintenance_schedule which has frequency and last_maintenance. The frequency is required and must be from enum: Monthly, Quarterly, Biannually. The user specified quarterly, so that's good. Last maintenance date is optional but the user says \"starting from today\", so maybe the last maintenance is today's date.\n\nWait, the user says \"starting from today\", which probably means the next maintenance is scheduled from today, so the last maintenance might be today. So for each sampler, set maintenance_schedule frequency to Quarterly and last_maintenance to 2023-05-24.\n\nBut the API requires sampler_id. So for each of the three IDs, need to make a separate API call. Wait, the parameters for the API include sampler_id as a required string. So each call is for one sampler_id. The user provided three IDs, so three separate API requests.\n\nCheck if maintenance_schedule is required. The required list for the API is ['sampler_id'], and maintenance_schedule is inside the properties but not in required. Wait, looking at the parameters:\n\nThe parameters object has required: ['sampler_id']. The maintenance_schedule is a property but not required. However, the user is specifying the maintenance schedule, so we need to include it.\n\nWait, the user says \"use a quarterly maintenance schedule starting from today\". So the user wants to set the maintenance_schedule for each sampler. Therefore, for each sampler_id, we need to include maintenance_schedule with frequency 'Quarterly' and last_maintenance as '2023-05-24'.\n\nWait, the maintenance_schedule object has required: ['frequency'], so frequency must be provided. The user said quarterly, so that's covered. last_maintenance is optional but the user mentions \"starting from today\", which likely means the last maintenance was today. So include last_maintenance as 2023-05-24.\n\nSo for each sampler_id (WS100, WS101, WS102), create an API call with sampler_id and maintenance_schedule (frequency: 'Quarterly', last_maintenance: '2023-05-24').\n\nWait, the date format should be a string in date format, so '2023-05-24' is correct.\n\nNow, the API name is water_quality_get_sampler_durability. Each call needs sampler_id and the maintenance_schedule object.\n\nSo three API calls:\n\nFor WS100: [water_quality_get_sampler_durability(sampler_id='WS100', maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', 'last_maintenance': '2023-05-24'})]\n\nSimilarly for WS101 and WS102.\n\nWait, the parameters for maintenance_schedule are an object. In the API spec, maintenance_schedule is an object with properties frequency and last_maintenance. So in the API call, it should be structured as a JSON object. But in the output format, how to represent it? The example shows parameters as key1='value1', etc. But maintenance_schedule is an object. Wait, the problem says: \"replace key1, key2, etc., with the actual parameter names, and value1, value2, etc., with the actual parameter values.\"\n\nBut maintenance_schedule is a parameter of type object. How to represent that in the output? The example in the instructions shows for parameters with objects, but looking at the problem statement: \"If the API parameter description does not specify otherwise, the parameter is optional (parameters mentioned in the user input need to be included in the output; if not mentioned, they do not need to be included).\"\n\nWait, the user input mentions using a quarterly maintenance schedule starting from today. So maintenance_schedule is mentioned, so it should be included. The maintenance_schedule has frequency and last_maintenance. The user specified quarterly (so frequency is Quarterly) and starting from today, so last_maintenance is today's date.\n\nBut in the API parameters, maintenance_schedule is an object. How to format that in the API call string.\n\nThe instruction says: \"the output should be in the format [ApiName(key1='value1', key2='value2', ...)]\".\n\nSo for a parameter that's an object, like maintenance_schedule, how to represent it? Maybe as a dictionary string.\n\nWait, in Python, when you pass a dictionary as a parameter, it's represented as maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', ...}.\n\nSo the expected output would have maintenance_schedule as a dictionary inside the parameters.\n\nSo for each sampler, the API call would have sampler_id='WS100', maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', 'last_maintenance': '2023-05-24'}\n\nTherefore, three separate API calls for each sampler ID.\n</think>\n\n[water_quality_get_sampler_durability(sampler_id='WS100', maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', 'last_maintenance': '2023-05-24'}), water_quality_get_sampler_durability(sampler_id='WS101', maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', 'last_maintenance': '2023-05-24'}), water_quality_get_sampler_durability(sampler_id='WS102', maintenance_schedule={'frequency': 'Quarterly', 'last_maintenance': '2023-05-24'})"}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what API the assistant needs to call here. The user is asking for a detailed weather forecast for Paris, France from May 28, 2023, starting at 12:00 to May 29, 2023, ending at 12:00.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available APIs. The first one listed is WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast. Its description says it provides detailed weather forecasts with real-time temperature, humidity, etc., for specified locations and times. The parameters required are location (with latitude and longitude) and time (start and end in date-time format). \n\nThe user mentioned Paris, France. But the location parameter requires latitude and longitude, not the city name. Hmm, but the API's location description says \"geographical coordinates or the city name\". Wait, looking at the parameters for location, it's an object with latitude and longitude as required. So maybe even though the description says city name, the actual parameters need coordinates. Wait, the parameters under location are latitude and longitude, both required. So the user provided the city name, but the API needs coordinates. However, the assistant might have to convert Paris to coordinates. But since this is a simulation, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the city name as coordinates? Wait, no, the parameters specify that location is an object with latitude and longitude as numbers. So the assistant can't use city name here. Wait, the description for location says: \"The geographical coordinates or the city name where the forecast is required.\" But the parameters under location require latitude and longitude. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the API expects either coordinates or city name, but the parameters are structured as an object with latitude and longitude. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the API actually requires coordinates, and the description is a bit misleading. Since the parameters for location have required latitude and longitude, the assistant must provide those. But the user didn't give coordinates, just \"Paris, France\". So in a real scenario, the assistant might need to first get the coordinates of Paris, but given the context here, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the assistant can map Paris to coordinates. However, since this is a test case, perhaps we are to use placeholders or the API accepts city name. Wait, no, the parameters clearly state latitude and longitude as required numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant is supposed to infer the coordinates for Paris. For example, Paris is approximately 48.858889 latitude and 2.320041 longitude. But the problem is, the user didn't provide these, so the assistant would have to know them. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, perhaps the assistant is expected to use these values. Alternatively, maybe the API in this context allows city name as a string, but according to the parameters given, location is an object with latitude and longitude. So the correct approach is to provide latitude and longitude for Paris.\n\nSo, for Paris, France, the coordinates are roughly 48.8589Â° N, 2.3200Â° E. So latitude 48.8589, longitude 2.3200.\n\nThe time parameters are start and end in date-time format. The user said from May 28, 2023, starting at 12:00 to May 29, 2023, ending at 12:00. So start is 2023-05-28T12:00:00, end is 2023-05-29T12:00:00.\n\nThe dataOptions are optional, like includeHumidity and updateFrequency. The user asked for a detailed forecast, which probably includes humidity, but since it's optional and the user didn't specify, maybe we can omit it or set includeHumidity to true. However, the problem states: \"If the API parameter description does not specify otherwise, the parameter is optional (parameters mentioned in the user input need to be included in the output; if not mentioned, they do not need to be included).\" The user didn't mention humidity or update frequency, so we don't need to include dataOptions.\n\nSo the required parameters are location (with lat and long) and time (start and end). So the API call should be WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast with location.latitude=48.8589, location.longitude=2.3200, time.start='2023-05-28T12:00:00', time.end='2023-05-29T12:00:00'.\n\nWait, but the user said \"Paris, France\", so the coordinates should be correct. Let me confirm the exact coordinates. Paris, France has a latitude of approximately 48.85889 and longitude 2.32004. So rounding to, say, 48.8589 and 2.3200.\n\nTherefore, the API request would be WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast with those coordinates and the specified time range.\n\nOther APIs like WeatherInspiredPoetryGenerator or aviation_weather_get_water_vapor_data don't seem relevant here since the user is asking for a standard weather forecast. The weather_ml_integration is for integrating ML models, which isn't what the user is asking for.\n\nSo the correct API call is WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast with the location coordinates for Paris and the time range provided.\n</think>\n\n[WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast(location={'latitude': 48.8589, 'longitude': 2.3200}, time={'start': '"}

So the API call would include both if needed.\n\nWait, the API is called WebSecurity_EncryptionManager, and it has two main parameters: sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption. Each of those has their own required parameters.\n\nSo the user is asking for two operations: renew SSL and encrypt data. Therefore, the API call should include both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption in the same request.\n\nWait, but the API's required fields are none. So the parameters are optional objects. So in the API call, we need to include both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption as parameters.\n\nWait, let me check the API spec again.\n\nThe parameters for WebSecurity_EncryptionManager are:\n\n- sslTlsManagement (object with required certificateId and action)\n- dataAtRestEncryption (object with required encryptionType and dataIdentifier)\n\nSo the main API call would have both these objects as parameters.\n\nSo the correct structure is:\n\nWebSecurity_EncryptionManager(\n    sslTlsManagement={certificateId: 'ABC123', action: 'renew', validityPeriod: '1 year'},\n    dataAtRestEncryption={encryptionType: 'AES', dataIdentifier: 'Data001', encryptionLevel: '256-bit'}\n)\n\nBut the output needs to be in the format [ApiName(key1='value1', ...)]. Wait, but the parameters here are objects. How is this represented?\n\nWait, looking at the example in the instructions: [ApiName(key1='value1', key2='value2', ...)], so for nested objects, how to format?\n\nWait, maybe the parameters are structured as nested. Let me check the API spec again.\n\nThe parameters for WebSecurity_EncryptionManager are a type 'object' with properties sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption, each being objects.\n\nSo in the API call, you would have sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption as top-level parameters, each containing their own parameters.\n\nSo the correct way to write it would be:\n\nWebSecurity_EncryptionManager(sslTlsManagement={'certificateId': 'ABC123', 'action': 'renew', 'validityPeriod': '1 year'}, dataAtRestEncryption={'encryptionType': 'AES', 'dataIdentifier': 'Data001', 'encryptionLevel': '256-bit'})\n\nBut the problem is how to represent this in the specified format. The example given in the instructions uses key1='value1', but here the values are objects. However, the instructions say: \"replacing ApiName with the actual API name, key1, key2, etc., with the actual parameter names, and value1, value2, etc., with the actual parameter values.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the parameters for the API are sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption, which are objects. So in the API call, the parameters would be sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption, each with their own parameters.\n\nBut how to format nested parameters in the string. Wait, the example in the instructions shows a flat structure. However, given the API spec, maybe the assistant is supposed to pass the nested parameters as part of the main API call.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to list each top-level parameter with their nested structure. However, the output format requires key1='value1', etc. So for nested objects, maybe the value is a dictionary string.\n\nBut the instructions don't specify how to handle nested parameters. However, looking at the problem statement: \"If the API parameter description does not specify otherwise, the parameter is optional (parameters mentioned in the user input need to be included in the output; if not mentioned, they do not need to be included).\"\n\nWait, perhaps the API is designed such that sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption are separate parameters of the API, each being a complex object. So in the API call, you have to include both parameters with their respective sub-parameters.\n\nBut how to represent that in the required output format. The example given in the problem is [ApiName(key1='value1', key2='value2', ...)], so for nested parameters, maybe the value is a string representation of the object.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"use the user's original text for the parameter value\" if the format isn't specified. However, in this case, the parameters are objects. But the API specs probably expect that the assistant structures the parameters correctly"}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_48", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is working on a research paper about the Gobi Desert and needs detailed information about key mammalian species from 2000 to 2010.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available APIs to see which one can provide that information. Looking at the API specs:\n\nThere's the 'desert_mammal_species' API. Its description says it retrieves info about key mammalian species in specified deserts over selected time periods. The required parameters are 'desert' and 'timePeriod' (with startYear and endYear). The user mentioned the Gobi Desert and the years 2000 to 2010, so that fits.\n\nLooking at the parameters: desert should be 'Gobi', timePeriod startYear 2000, endYear 2010. The user didn't specify particular species or conservation statuses, so those optional parameters (speciesDetails) can be omitted since they're not required. The required fields are covered.\n\nOther APIs like generate_high_resolution_map or SatelliteImageFetcher don't seem relevant here since the user is asking for species data, not maps or satellite images. NavigationService is unrelated. So the correct API to call is desert_mammal_species with the specified parameters.\n</think>\n\n[desert_mammal_species(desert='Gobi', timePeriod={'startYear': 2000, 'endYear': 2010})]"}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_49", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to deploy a deep learning model called \"HandGestureNet\" using TensorFlow. The training should start on January 12, 2025, at 9 AM and end on January 14 at 5 PM in America/New_York time zone.\n\nFirst, I need to check which API to use. The available APIs are AITrendAnalyzer_predictMaintenance and BehaviorMimicAI_deployModel. The user's request is about deploying a model, so it's the second one: BehaviorMimicAI_deployModel.\n\nLooking at the parameters for BehaviorMimicAI_deployModel. The required parameters are modelDetails and trainingSchedule. ModelDetails needs modelName and framework. The user provided \"HandGestureNet\" and TensorFlow, which is in the enum (TensorFlow or Keras). Good.\n\nTrainingSchedule requires startTime, endTime, and timeZone. The user gave dates and times: Jan 12, 2025, 09:00 AM and Jan 14, 2025, 05:00 PM, time zone America/New_York. Need to convert those to ISO 8601 format. \n\nJanuary 12, 2025, 09:00 AM in America/New_York would be 2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00 (since New York is UTC-5 during standard time). Wait, but daylight saving might affect it. However, January is standard time, so UTC-5. Similarly, end time is 2025-01-14T17:00:00-05:00.\n\nWait, but the API requires startTime and endTime in ISO 8601 format. So I should write them as \"2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00\" and \"2025-01-14T17:00:00-05:00\". Alternatively, using the time zone name, but the format for date-time in parameters is specified as string with format date-time, which usually is ISO 8601, possibly with timezone offset or timezone name. However, the timeZone parameter is separate, so maybe the startTime and endTime should be in UTC or with timezone offset. Wait, the trainingSchedule parameters have startTime and endTime as date-time strings, and timeZone as a separate string. So perhaps the startTime and endTime are in the specified timeZone, but represented in ISO 8601 with the timezone offset, or maybe they are in UTC. Wait, the description for timeZone says \"Time zone of the training schedule\", so maybe the startTime and endTime are in that time zone, but the ISO 8601 format requires the offset. Hmm.\n\nWait, the timeZone parameter is a string like \"America/New_York\", which is a timezone name from the IANA database. The startTime and endTime are in ISO 8601 format. The correct way is to either include the timezone offset in the startTime and endTime (e.g., -05:00 for EST) or use the timezone name. But ISO 8601 typically uses offsets. However, since the API has a separate timeZone parameter, maybe the startTime and endTime are in that time zone but expressed in local time without offset, but that's not standard. Wait, the parameter description for startTime and endTime says \"in ISO 8601 format\", which usually includes the timezone offset. But the timeZone parameter is also provided. Maybe the startTime and endTime are in UTC, and the timeZone is for scheduling purposes. Or perhaps the startTime and endTime are in the specified timeZone, and the ISO 8601 string should include the offset corresponding to that timeZone.\n\nFor example, America/New_York on January 12, 2025 is UTC-5. So 09:00 AM there would be 2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00. Similarly for the end time.\n\nSo converting the user's input:\n\nStart: January 12, 2025, 09:00 AM America/New_York â†’ 2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00\n\nEnd: January 14, 2025, 05:00 PM America/New_York â†’ 2025-01-14T17:00:00-05:00\n\nTime zone parameter is \"America/New_York\".\n\nSo the parameters for trainingSchedule would be:\n\nstartTime: '2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00'\n\nendTime: '2025-01-14T17:00:00-05:00'\n\ntimeZone: 'America/New_York'\n\nWait, but the timeZone parameter's pattern is ^[A-Za-z_/]+$, which matches \"America/New_York\".\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nmodelDetails: { modelName: 'HandGestureNet', framework: 'TensorFlow' }\n\ntrainingSchedule: { startTime: '2025-01-12T09:00:00-05:00', endTime: '2025-01-14T17:00:00-05:00', timeZone: 'America/New_York' }\n\nCheck required parameters: modelDetails requires"}
