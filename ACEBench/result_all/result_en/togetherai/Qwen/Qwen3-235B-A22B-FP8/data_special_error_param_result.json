The user wants to evaluate their rehab plan with ID 1234WrongID on October 21, 2023, and an effectiveness score of 8.\n\nFirst, I need to check the API specifications for RehabPlanEvaluator. The required parameters are plan_id, evaluation_date, and effectiveness_score. \n\nLooking at the plan_id: the pattern allows alphanumeric characters and hyphens. The user provided 1234WrongID, which seems okay, but maybe the hyphen is missing? Wait, the pattern is ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$, so the ID should only have letters, numbers, and hyphens. The example ID has \"WrongID\" without a hyphen, but that's allowed as long as there are no other invalid characters. Wait, but maybe \"1234WrongID\" is valid because it's alphanumeric without any special characters. Hmm, maybe the user's plan_id is acceptable. Or is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, the user's plan_id is \"1234WrongID\". Let me check the pattern again. The pattern allows uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. There's no restriction on the order, just the allowed characters. So \"1234WrongID\" is valid because it's alphanumeric, no invalid characters. So maybe that's correct.\n\nNext, evaluation_date is 2023-10-21, which matches the YYYY-MM-DD format. Good.\n\nEffectiveness_score is 8, which is between 1 and 10, so that's valid.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"1234WrongID\". Maybe the system expects a specific format, like hyphens in certain positions. However, the API's pattern only checks allowed characters, not the structure. So as per the given specs, the plan_id is valid. So all required parameters are provided with correct formats. Therefore, the RehabPlanEvaluator API should be called with those parameters. But wait, the user's message says \"evaluate my rehab plan ID: 1234WrongID\". So the plan_id is 1234WrongID. The API's pattern allows that. So no error here. So I should generate the API call.\n</think>\n\n[RehabPlanEvaluator(plan_id='1234WrongID', evaluation_date='2023-10-21', effectiveness_score=8)]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_1", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to search for double-slit experiment data published on 12-Feb-2021. Looking at the API specifications, the relevant function here is DoubleSlitExperimentSearch. The parameters required for this function are publication_date and journal_name. The publication_date is mandatory, and it needs to be in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The user provided the date as 12-Feb-2021, which is in the format DD-MMM-YYYY. This doesn't match the required YYYY-MM-DD pattern. The journal_name is optional since it's not listed in the required parameters. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the date format. The user's input uses \"12-Feb-2021\" which is not correct. The correct format should be \"2021-02-12\". Since the publication_date is a required parameter and the format is incorrect, according to the strategy outlined in scenario 2, part (1), I need to point out the incorrect value for the parameter. The user provided the key detail (publication date) but in the wrong format. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that there's an incorrect value for the publication_date parameter.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (12-Feb-2021) for the parameters (publication_date) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_2", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me look at the user's request. They want the stock volatility from last week for the ticker 'Goog'. \n\nFirst, I need to check the available APIs. The WeeklyStockVolatility function seems relevant here. It requires a ticker and an end_date. The ticker is given as 'Goog', but wait, the parameters specify that the ticker must be uppercase letters only. 'Goog' has lowercase letters, so that's a problem. The end_date is needed in YYYY-MM-DD format. The user mentioned \"last week,\" but didn't specify the exact date.\n\nSo, there are two issues. The ticker symbol is in the wrong format, and the end_date is missing. I should point out the incorrect ticker and ask for the correct one. Also, I need the end date to proceed. The user might not know the exact date, so I should ask them to clarify that as well. \n\nWait, the API requires both ticker and end_date as mandatory. Since the user provided 'Goog' which is invalid, that's a parameter type issue. Also, the end_date is missing. So, according to the strategy, first check for incorrect values. The ticker is incorrect, so I should output that first. Then, the end_date is missing. But priority is given to incorrect parameters first. So, I need to mention the incorrect ticker and ask for the correct one. Then, after that, if the ticker is fixed, the end_date would be needed. However, in the current step, since both issues are present, but the ticker is invalid, I should first address that. \n\nTherefore, the response should indicate the incorrect ticker and prompt for the correct one, and also ask for the end date. But according to the specified strategy, if multiple issues exist, we need to handle them in order. Since the ticker is incorrect, that's a scenario (1) for ticker parameter. The end_date is missing, which is scenario (2). But according to the priority, first check scenario (1) for incorrect values. So, the output should first mention the incorrect value for 'ticker' and then ask for the missing parameters. Wait, the strategy says that steps have priority: first check if scenario (1) applies, then (2). \n\nIn the user's message, the ticker is 'Goog' which is invalid because it needs to be uppercase. So scenario (1) applies here. Also, the end_date is missing, which is scenario (2). But since the user's instruction includes an incorrect value for the ticker, we first address that. However, the output format in scenario (1) is to list the incorrect value. But in the problem, the user might have both incorrect values and missing parameters. However, according to the priority, scenario (1) comes first. So, the incorrect ticker is the first issue. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should output that the ticker has an incorrect value and then ask for the correct one. Also, after that, the end_date is missing. But according to the strategy, after handling scenario (1), if there are missing parameters, handle them. Wait, the strategy says that if multiple issues exist, scenario (1) takes precedence. But in the case of both an incorrect value and a missing parameter, the scenario (1) would be the first to address. However, the user's message might have both. \n\nThe output format for scenario (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"]. Then, if there are missing parameters, after that, maybe another entry. But according to the example in the strategy, each issue is addressed one at a time. However, the examples given in the problem statement might have multiple entries. \n\nWait, the user's message is \"Can you check the stock volatility from last week for the ticker 'Goog'?\" The ticker is 'Goog' which is invalid because it's not all uppercase. The end_date is missing because the user mentioned \"last week\" but the parameter requires a specific date. So, two issues: incorrect ticker and missing end_date. \n\nAccording to the priority, first check if any parameters have incorrect values. The ticker is invalid. So scenario (1) applies for the ticker. The output would be [\"There is incorrect value (Goog) for the parameters (ticker) in the conversation history.\"]. Then, after that, the end_date is missing. But since the user's request has already been flagged for the ticker, perhaps the assistant should first ask about the ticker. However, the scenario (2) requires that if parameters are missing, then output [\"Missing necessary parameters...\"]. \n\nBut according to the priority order, after scenario (1) is addressed, scenario (2) would come next. However, the assistant can't output both in the same step. Wait, the strategy says:\n\nNote: The above steps have a priority order. You need to first determine whether scenario (1) applies. If it does, output according to the requirements in (1). Pay attention to distinguishing between scenarios (1) and (2).\n\nTherefore, if scenario (1) is present, output that error, ignoring the missing parameters. However, if the incorrect value is the only issue, then after that, the next step would be to handle missing parameters. But in this step, since scenario (1) applies, we output that error. So the correct output here is to point out the incorrect value for the ticker. Then, in the next step (if the user corrects the ticker), the assistant would then ask for the missing end_date. \n\nBut in this case, both issues exist. However, according to the strategy, the first priority is to handle incorrect parameters. Therefore, the correct output here is [\"There is incorrect value (Goog) for the parameters"}

Let me look at the available APIs.\n\nThe Network_Condition_Check API requires location, ping_time, packet_loss, and connection_type. The location needs to be in latitude and longitude format. The user provided the coordinates as 45.ABC,-120.33. Wait, the pattern for location is ^-?\\d{1,2}\\.\\d+,\\s*-?\\d{1,3}\\.\\d+$. Let's check that.\n\nThe first part is 45.ABC. But the pattern expects digits before the decimal. Here, \"ABC\" is not a valid number. So the location value is incorrect. The user's input for location doesn't match the required format. Also, the other parameters like ping_time, packet_loss, and connection_type are missing. \n\nSo according to the priority rules, first check if there's an incorrect value. The location parameter has an invalid value. Therefore, I should output that there's an incorrect value for the location parameter. The other missing parameters are secondary here because the location is invalid. \n\nSo the correct output should mention the incorrect value for location and not ask about the missing parameters first. That fits scenario (1) of the second part, where the parameter type doesn't match.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (45.ABC,-120.33) for the parameters (location) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The assistant needs to check which API can handle this.\n\nLooking at the available APIs, the OperaTicketDetails function seems relevant. It requires the event_id, which the user provided as \"event123\". The parameters for OperaTicketDetails are event_id (required) and ticket_type (optional, with options VIP, Regular, Student). \n\nThe user didn't specify a ticket type, so the assistant should call the API with just the event_id. The event_id format is supposed to be an 8-character alphanumeric string. \"event123\" is 9 characters long, which includes a number and lowercase letters. Wait, the pattern is [A-Z0-9]{8}, so uppercase letters and numbers. The user's ID is \"event123\", which has lowercase 'e' and 'v', etc. So maybe the event_id is invalid because it's lowercase and longer than 8 characters?\n\nBut the user provided \"event123\" as the ID. The assistant should check if this ID meets the API's requirements. The event_id needs to be exactly 8 characters, uppercase letters and/or numbers. The user's input is 9 characters, including lowercase letters. That's incorrect. So the assistant should inform the user that the event_id is invalid. \n\nBut wait, the user might have made a typo. Maybe they meant \"EVENT123\" which would be 8 characters. But as per the current input, the assistant should point out the incorrect value. Therefore, the correct response is to indicate that the event_id doesn't match the required format. \n\nSo the answer should be [\"There is incorrect value (event123) for the parameters (event_id) in the conversation history.\"]\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (event123) for the parameters (event_id) in the conversation history.\"]"}

Looking at the API specifications, the relevant function here is SmartwatchReviewAnalysis. \n\nFirst, check the parameters required: model_name and review_count. The model_name needs to be alphanumeric with 3-50 characters. The provided model is 'xyz#123', which includes a hashtag. The pattern for model_name is ^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s]+$, so the hashtag is not allowed. That's an issue.\n\nNext, review_count must be a positive integer. The user specified 300, which is valid. But since the model_name is invalid, the API can't be called. According to the strategy, since the parameters have an incorrect value, we need to point that out. The error here is in the model_name parameter, which has an incorrect format. So the response should be a message indicating that the model name is invalid.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (xyz#123) for the parameters (model_name) in the conversation history.\"]"}

Then XYZ@4321 has an '@' symbol, which isn't alphanumeric. So both IDs don't meet the criteria.\n\nSince the user provided the device IDs but they don't match the required format, this falls under scenario 2(1).

The API they need is SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder.\n\nFirst, check the parameters. The required parameter is seafood_ingredient. The user provided \"Shrimp@123\". Wait, the API's seafood_ingredient has a min length of 3 and max 40, which is okay here. But the value has \"@123\" which might not be allowed. The parameter's type is a string, but does it allow special characters? The description doesn't specify a pattern, so maybe it's acceptable. However, the desired_texture is \"crispy\", which matches the pattern (only letters). Cooking_method is frying, which is valid.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"crispy\" but in the question it's 'crispy' with single quotes. But the parameter expects a string. The API's desired_texture has a pattern of ^[a-zA-Z]+$, so \"crispy\" is valid. Cooking_method is \"frying\" which is okay.\n\nBut the seafood_ingredient is \"Shrimp@123\". The parameter allows any string between 3-40 characters. The @ and numbers are allowed since the pattern isn't restricted. Wait, no, the API's seafood_ingredient doesn't have a pattern specified, only min and max length. So the presence of @123 isn't invalid. But maybe it's a typo? The user wrote \"Shrimp@123\" which is 8 characters, so within 3-40. But the system might expect just \"shrimp\". However, according to the API specs, as long as the length is okay, any characters are allowed. But the user might have made a mistake. However, the assistant should check if the value matches the API's parameters. Since the API allows any string here, even with numbers and symbols, the input is technically valid. Wait, but maybe the API expects a real seafood name. But according to the specs, there's no pattern, so the system shouldn't assume. Therefore, the problem is that the user provided \"Shrimp@123\" which may not be correct. But according to the API's parameters, it's acceptable. However, the assistant might need to point out if there's an incorrect value. Wait, the strategy says if the type or form doesn't match, ask. But if the API allows any string, then it's okay. Hmm, but perhaps the user made a typo. But the assistant's job is to follow the API specs strictly. So in this case, the API allows any string for seafood_ingredient, so the input is valid. Therefore, proceed to call the API with the given parameters. Wait, but the user wrote \"The seafood ingredient is Shrimp@123.\" So the assistant should use that exact value. So the API call should be SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder with seafood_ingredient='Shrimp@123', desired_texture='crispy', cooking_method='frying'. But wait, the cooking_method wasn't specified in the user's message. Wait, the user said \"I'll be using frying.\" So cooking_method should be 'frying'. \n\nWait, the user's message: \"I want to find a seafood substitute for shrimp with a texture like 'crispy', and I'll be using frying. The seafood ingredient is Shrimp@123.\" So all parameters are provided. So the assistant should call the API with those values. But the seafood_ingredient's value has @123. According to the API's parameters, there's no restriction on characters, only length. So it's acceptable. Therefore, the correct API call is SeafoodTasteSubstituteFinder(seafood_ingredient='Shrimp@123', desired_texture='crispy', cooking_method='frying'). \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended \"Shrimp\" without the @123. Maybe they made a typo. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should check if the parameters are correctly formatted. Since the API allows any string, the assistant should use the user's input as given. Therefore, the correct output is the API call with those parameters. However, if the API's seafood_ingredient has a requirement that's not mentioned, but in the specs, it's not.

First, I need to check the API parameters. The API PlantSelectorByEnvironment requires humidity_level and room_size.\n\nThe user mentioned \"moist air conditions,\" which probably translates to the humidity_level. The options are low, medium, or high. So \"moist\" likely means medium or high. But the exact value might need clarification, but since it's a user input, I should use the closest enum value. Maybe \"high\" is the right choice here, but the user might not know the exact terms. However, the API requires one of the three, so I'll go with that.\n\nNext, the room size is 250 square feet. But the API expects room_size in square meters. Oh, right! The parameter description says it's in square meters. So I need to convert 250 square feet to square meters. Let me calculate that. 1 square foot is about 0.0929 square meters. So 250 * 0.0929 ≈ 23.225. So rounding to the nearest integer, it's 23. But the API's room_size has a minimum of 5 and maximum of 100, so 23 is within that range. So the value should be 23.\n\nWait, but the user provided square feet, and the API requires square meters. So the assistant should convert that. So the parameters would be humidity_level='high' (assuming moist is high) and room_size=23. Then the API call would be PlantSelectorByEnvironment(humidity_level='high', room_size=23).\n\nWait, but the user might not know the difference between square feet and meters. The room_size parameter's description says \"size of the room in square meters,\" so the assistant should convert the user's input. Therefore, the correct parameters are humidity_level and the converted room size. So the API call is correct here.\n</think>\n\n[PlantSelectorByEnvironment(humidity_level='high', room_size=23)]"}

That's a problem. The pattern is ^\\d{5}$, so it needs to be 5 digits. So team_id is incorrect here.\n\nProject_deadline is given as 2023-11-30, which is in YYYY-MM-DD format. That seems correct. So the deadline parameter is fine.\n\nSince the team_id is not 5 digits, this falls under scenario 1(1) where the parameter value type or form doesn't match. The user provided \"123\" which is a string but not 5 digits. So I need to output that there's an incorrect value for team_id. \n\nThe correct approach is to point out that the team_id is invalid and ask the user to provide a 5-digit numeric string.

The user provided \"123.abc.web\" as the website. I should check if this URL matches the required pattern. The pattern for website_url is a valid URL format, which includes optional http:// or https://, followed by the domain name and TLD. The given URL \"123.abc.web\" seems to lack a TLD (like .com, .net, etc.), but \"web\" might be considered a TLD here. However, the pattern allows for a TLD of 2 to 6 letters, so \"web\" is valid. The rest of the domain parts are alphanumeric with dots, which fits.\n\nNext, there's an optional parameter called scan_depth, which ranges from 1 to 5. The user didn't specify a scan depth, so maybe the default should be used, but since it's optional, I can include a default value, say 3, or leave it out. However, the API requires website_url as mandatory, and scan_depth is optional. Since the user hasn't provided scan_depth, the assistant should call the API with just the website_url. \n\nWait, but the user's message doesn't mention any scan depth. So according to the API specs, the only required parameter is website_url. Therefore, the correct API call should be WebsiteSecurityAnalyzer with website_url set to \"123.abc.web\".

Looking at the API specs, the relevant function is Check_Data_Exposure. The required parameter is email_address, which needs to be a valid email format. The provided email is bob@@example.com. Wait, that looks a bit odd. Valid emails usually have a local part, an @, and a domain. But the domain part here is example.com, which is okay, but the local part is bob@. Hmm, actually, the pattern for email_address is [\\\\w-\\\\.]+@([\\\\w-]+\\\\.)+[\\\\w-]{2,4}, so after the @, there should be a domain name. Example.com is valid. But the local part before the @ is bob@@example.com's part before the last @. Wait, no: the email is bob@@example.com. So splitting at the last @, the local part would be bob@ and the domain is example.com. Wait, but the local part can't have a @ in it, right? Wait, the email format allows for quoted strings with special characters, but the regex here is [\\\\w-\\\\.]+@..., which doesn't include quotes. So the given email bob@@example.com would have a local part of bob@, which includes an @. That would make the email invalid because the local part can't have an @ unless it's quoted. But the regex doesn't allow for quotes. So the pattern here requires the email to match ^[\\\\w-\\\\.]+@([\\\\w-]+\\\\.)+[\\\\w-]{2,4}$. So the local part is [\\\\w-\\\\.]+, which includes word characters, hyphens, and dots. The @ is in the local part here, which would make it invalid. So the email provided is invalid. Therefore, the Check_Data_Exposure function's email_address parameter requires a valid email.

The user's query is about economic data comparing urban and rural areas in a province, so the relevant API here is UrbanRuralEconomicComparison.\n\nLooking at the parameters for UrbanRuralEconomicComparison: it requires province_name and year. The province_name should be a string with letters and spaces, between 3-50 characters. The user mentioned \"Hunan123\". Hunan is a valid province name, but \"123\" is appended. Wait, the province name should be valid. Wait, Hunan is a real province in China, but the user wrote \"Hunan123\". The pattern for province_name is letters and spaces only. The 123 here are numbers, which are not allowed. So the province_name parameter is invalid because of the \"123\". \n\nAdditionally, the year is 2023, which is a four-digit number, so that should be okay. The parameters required are province_name and year. So the province_name is invalid here because of the numbers. So the user's input has an incorrect value for the province_name parameter. Therefore, according to the strategy, we need to point out that there's an incorrect value. The output should be [\"There is incorrect value (Hunan123) for the parameters (province_name) in the conversation history.\"]\n\nWait, but maybe Hunan123 is a typo. But according to the API's parameters, the province name should be letters and spaces. So the 123 is invalid. Therefore, the user provided an incorrect value. So the correct response is to indicate that province_name has an incorrect value. The other parameter, year, is 2023, which is valid. So the main issue is with province_name.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (Hunan123) for the parameters (province_name) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_17", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for diversification strategy metrics for Q5 2023. First, I need to check which API to use. The available APIs are CostForecastAnalyzer and DiversificationPerformanceMetrics. The user mentioned \"diversification strategy metrics,\" so the DiversificationPerformanceMetrics API is the right one.\n\nLooking at the parameters for that API: metric_type, time_period, and region. The required parameters are metric_type and time_period. The user provided \"Q5 2023\" as the time period. But wait, the time_period parameter has a pattern that allows either 'Q1 2023' or '2023'. The pattern is ^(Q[1-4]\\\\s\\\\d{4}|\\\\d{4})$. So Q5 isn't valid because the quarter can only be 1-4. That's an issue. Also, the user didn't specify the metric_type, which is required. They might have forgotten to include it. So there are two problems here: the time_period is invalid and metric_type is missing. \n\nAccording to the priority rules, first check for incorrect values. Since \"Q5 2023\" doesn't match the allowed quarters (Q1-Q4), that's an incorrect value for time_period. Also, metric_type is missing. But the user's instruction lacks the required metric_type. However, the priority is to check incorrect values first. So the output should point out the incorrect time_period and the missing metric_type. But according to the strategy, if there's an incorrect value, we should mention that first. However, the user's query has both incorrect parameter and missing parameter. Wait, but the metric_type is required. Since the user didn't provide it, that's a missing parameter. However, the time_period is invalid. The system needs to handle both. But according to the priority, the first step is to check for incorrect values. So in this case, the time_period is invalid (Q5 is not allowed), so the first error should be about that. Then, the metric_type is missing. However, the output format for scenario (1) is [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) in the conversation history.\"], and for scenario (2) [\"Missing necessary parameters (key1, key2, ...) for the api (ApiName)\"]. \n\nSo the incorrect time_period is scenario (1), and the missing metric_type is scenario (2). But the priority is first check (1), then (2). So first check if any parameters have incorrect values. Since the user provided \"Q5 2023\" which doesn't match the pattern, that's an incorrect value. So the first response should be to indicate that the time_period value is incorrect. Then, since the metric_type is missing, that's another issue. However, the output format for the response requires that if scenario (1) applies, output the incorrect value message. If multiple issues exist, but scenario (1) applies, do we need to list all incorrect values first, then handle missing? Or do we handle the first error found?\n\nThe note says the steps have priority order: first (1), then (2). So if there's an incorrect value (scenario 1), we output the error for that. Then, even if other parameters are missing, they might be handled in a subsequent step after the user corrects the incorrect value. However, in the current case, the user's request has both an incorrect value and a missing parameter. So according to the priority, first, the system should inform the user about the incorrect value (time_period), then once that's fixed, ask for the missing metric_type. But according to the output rules, the assistant must output all relevant errors in one go? Or only the first applicable?\n\nThe instructions say that the steps have a priority order. So first, check for scenario (1): incorrect values. If any, output the error (as per scenario 1). If not, check for scenario (2): missing parameters. If the user's instructions lack key details (scenario 2), then output the missing parameters. If both scenario (1) and (2) apply, handle scenario (1) first. So in this case, since the time_period is invalid (scenario 1 applies), the assistant should output the incorrect value message. The missing metric_type would be handled after the user corrects the time_period. However, in the current step, the assistant must point out all issues that prevent the API call. Wait, the note says the priority is: first determine if scenario (1) applies. If it does, output according to (1). Otherwise, check (2). So if there's both an incorrect value and a missing parameter, the assistant should first point out the incorrect value. The missing parameter would be considered only after the incorrect value is fixed. Therefore, in this case, the assistant should generate the error message for the invalid time_period. The metric_type is missing, but since scenario (1) is triggered, we don't mention the missing parameters until scenario (1) is resolved. Therefore, the correct output is [\"There is incorrect value (Q5 2023) for the parameters (time_period) in the conversation history.\"]. \n\nWait, but maybe both issues can be reported? But according to the priority rules, the assistant must first check scenario (1). If scenario (1) applies (i.e., there's an incorrect value), then output the scenario (1) message. If there are also missing parameters, they are not mentioned until the user fixes the incorrect value. So in this case, the assistant should only report the incorrect time_period. The user might have to correct that first. Therefore, the correct response"}

First, I need to check the available APIs. The MusicPlatformRatings function is designed for fetching album ratings from specific platforms. The parameters required are album_name and platform. The album name here is 'Greatest Hits', which seems valid as it's between 2 and 100 characters. However, the platform specified is SoundCloud. Looking at the allowed platforms for MusicPlatformRatings, the options are Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. SoundCloud isn't listed there. So, the platform parameter has an incorrect value. Since the user provided the necessary details but the platform isn't supported, I should point out the incorrect parameter. The correct approach is to inform the user that SoundCloud isn't an allowed platform and list the available options instead.

The user provided \"123City\" which is 6 characters long, so that's okay. Budget range is a string like '100000-500000', which matches the pattern. Wait, but the city name's pattern isn't specified beyond the min and max length. The user's city is \"123City\", which includes numbers. The API's city_name parameter allows any string with 3-50 characters, including numbers? The description says \"city name\" but the pattern isn't restricted to letters. So the city name is acceptable. The budget is correctly formatted. So both parameters are provided. Wait, but the RealEstateInvestmentOpportunities API requires 'city_name' and optional 'budget_range'. The user provided both. So the API call should be valid. Wait, but the user's city is \"123City\", which is allowed as the parameter allows any string of 3-50 characters.

The surgery_type is given as \"Knee%Surgery\", which needs to be a string with letters and spaces, between 5-100 characters. The % symbol might be an issue because the pattern allows only letters and spaces. So, the surgery_type parameter might be invalid here.

The relevant one here is RealEstateInvestmentOpportunities. The parameters required are city_name and optionally budget_range. \n\nLooking at the parameters: city_name must be a string between 3 and 50 characters. The user wrote \"New@York\", which has an @ symbol. That's probably invalid because city names typically don't have special characters. The API's pattern isn't specified, but the description says the city name must be a string. The @ might be a typo, maybe they meant New York with a space. \n\nBudget_range needs to be in the format like '100000-500000'. The user specified between 100000 and 500000, so the budget_range should be '100000-500000'. \n\nSo the city_name parameter is the issue here.

The parameters required are payment_method, site_url, and encryption_check (optional). The payment_method has an enum with 'credit card', 'PayPal', 'bank transfer'. The user mentioned Bitcoin, which isn't in the enum. That's a problem. \n\nSo, the payment_method parameter doesn't accept Bitcoin. The API requires one of the specified methods. Also, the site_url must be a valid URL. The user provided www.shoppingexample.com, which might not have the protocol (http/https), so that might need checking. But the main issue is Bitcoin not being a valid payment_method. \n\nAccording to the rules, if the parameters have incorrect values (like Bitcoin here), I need to output scenario (1): point out the incorrect value for the parameter.

The user's request is about setting a sleep reminder, so the SleepReminderApp is the obvious choice here.\n\nLooking at the parameters for SleepReminderApp: it requires reminder_message, reminder_time, and optionally days_of_week. The user provided the message as \"Night\" and the time as 10 pm. \n\nWait, the reminder_message must be between 10 and 100 characters. The message \"Night\" is only 5 characters, which violates the minLength requirement. That's a problem. The user's input has an incorrect value for the reminder_message parameter. \n\nAlso, the reminder_time needs to be in HH:MM 24-hour format. The user said 10 pm, which should be converted to 22:00. But the user didn't specify the format, so even if converted, the message length issue remains.\n\nSince the message is too short, according to the strategy, I should point out the incorrect value. The user needs to provide a longer message. So the correct output here should be to indicate that the reminder_message is invalid because it's below the minimum length. \n\nI don't need to check other parameters like days_of_week because the required fields are reminder_message and reminder_time.

First, I need to check the API parameters.\n\nLooking at RoadTripHighlights, the parameters required are departure, arrival, travel_mode, and max_distance. The user mentioned \"cycling\", so travel_mode is set. The detour distance is supposed to be max_distance, which should be an integer. The user wrote \"wrong20km\" – probably a typo. The correct value should be 20 as an integer. \n\nSo the problem here is that the user provided an incorrect value for max_distance. The API expects an integer, but got a string with \"wrong\" in front. Therefore, according to the strategy, this falls under scenario (1) where the parameter type is incorrect. The output should point out the incorrect value and the parameter. The other parameters like departure and arrival seem okay. Since the user didn't specify anything else, the missing parameters aren't an issue here. So the main issue is the max_distance value. The user needs to correct that.

The user provided 1234, which is only 4 digits. That's a problem. The service_type should be 'cleaning' or 'repair', and the user specified 'cleaning', which is valid. \n\nThe issue here is the postal code. The API requires a 5-digit number, but the user gave 1234.

The user gave the user_id, but I need to check if it fits the UUID format. The pattern is 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal characters. The given user_id is 98765-ABCD-1234, which seems too short. The first part before the dash is 5 characters, which doesn't match the required 8. So the user_id format is incorrect.\n\nNext, the phone_model is missing. The user didn't mention their phone model. The parameters require it to be between 3 and 50 characters. Without this, the API can't proceed. So we have two issues: incorrect user_id format and missing phone_model.\n\nAccording to the scenario rules, if there's an incorrect parameter value, I should point that out first.

The first API that comes to mind is CompareWashingMachines, which takes brand_list and max_price. Let me check the parameters.\n\nThe brand_list requires each brand name to be between 2 and 30 characters. Let's check the given brands. 'Wsh@123' has 6 characters. Wait, but the pattern allows any characters? The description doesn't specify, but the minLength and maxLength are met. However, the second brand is 'DrtyMach' which is 8 characters. Both are within the 2-30 limit. Wait, but the user wrote 'DrtyMach' but maybe a typo? But the main issue is the brand names' validity. Wait, the parameters for CompareWashingMachines' brand_list don't have a pattern, just min and max length. So 'Wsh@123' is acceptable in terms of length, but maybe the API expects actual brand names. But according to the API specs, as long as the length is okay, it's allowed. So that's okay. \n\nThen, the max_price is $300, which is a number and meets the minimum of 100. So CompareWashingMachines seems applicable here. So the API call should be CompareWashingMachines with brand_list=['Wsh@123', 'DrtyMach'], max_price=300.\n\nWait, but the user's brand names might be invalid. Like 'Wsh@123' has special characters and numbers. But according to the API specification, there's no restriction on the characters used in brand names, only the length. So technically, the parameters are acceptable. Therefore, the API can be called with those values.\n\nSo the answer should be the CompareWashingMachines API with those parameters.

The user specified '199-2020' which I notice has only three digits for the start year (199 instead of 1990). That doesn't match the required pattern of four digits for each year. Also, they asked for English, which is valid.\n\nSince the year_range format is incorrect, this falls under scenario 2(1) where there's an incorrect parameter value. The user provided the year as '199-2020', but the API expects something like '1990-2020'. So I need to point out the incorrect value for the year_range parameter and ask for clarification. The language is correct, so that's not an issue. The required parameter is present, but the format is wrong. Therefore, the correct output should indicate the incorrect value for year_range.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (199-2020) for the parameters (year_range) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_36", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking for youth sports programs for ages 8-10 in \"123Region\". The API required parameters are age_group and region. The age_group provided is \"8-10\", which matches the required format (digits separated by a hyphen). The region is \"123Region\". Wait, the region's pattern is only letters and spaces. But \"123Region\" has numbers. So the region parameter's value doesn't match the regex pattern ^[a-zA-Z\\s]+$. So the region is invalid. According to the API specs, the region must be a valid region name with letters and spaces only. So here, the region has numbers, which is incorrect. So this falls under strategy 1(1), where the parameter value type or form doesn't match. Therefore, the correct output should point out the incorrect value for the region parameter.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (123Region) for the parameters (region) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_37", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to find an international courier service to send a package to Germany, but the weight is listed as negative five kilograms. \n\nFirst, looking at the API specifications for the InternationalCourierServiceFinder. The required parameters are destination_country and weight_kg. The destination_country here is Germany, which is a valid country name. However, the weight_kg is given as negative five. The API specifies that weight_kg must be a positive number, with a minimum of 0.1. A negative weight doesn't make sense in this context, so that's a problem.\n\nSince the weight is invalid, according to the rules, if the parameter values don't match the API's requirements (like a negative number where a positive is needed), I should point out the incorrect value. The user might have made a typo, so the correct approach is to inform them about the invalid weight and ask for clarification. \n\nThe other API, TradeComplianceCheck, isn't needed here because the user's main request is about finding a courier, not checking compliance. So the main issue is the negative weight. I need to output the error message as per the strategy, indicating the incorrect value for weight_kg.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (-5) for the parameters (weight_kg) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_38", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user query. The user is asking for spicy dishes from 123India. First, I need to check the available APIs to see which one fits.\n\nLooking at the APIs, there's SpicyCuisineFinder which requires country_name and optionally dish_count. The country_name parameter needs to be a string with only letters and spaces. The user wrote \"123India\", which has numbers at the beginning. That's a problem because the pattern doesn't allow numbers. \n\nSo, the country_name parameter is invalid here. The user might have made a typo, maybe they meant \"India\" but added numbers by mistake. But according to the API specs, the country name should only have letters and spaces. So I need to point out that the value for country_name is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to inform the user about the invalid country name and ask them to provide a valid one. There's no need to call the API because the parameters don't meet the requirements. Also, the dish_count isn't specified, but the user didn't mention a number, so maybe they just want the default. However, the main issue is the country name. \n\nTherefore, the response should indicate that the country_name has an incorrect value and prompt the user to correct it.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (123India) for the parameters (country_name) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The user wants to set an alarm for 8:65 and get a weather forecast for New York.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available APIs. The relevant one here is Schedule_Alarm_With_Forecast. This API requires alarm_time and forecast_location. \n\nLooking at the alarm_time parameter: it needs to be in 24-hour format (HH:MM). The user specified 8:65. Wait, 65 minutes isn't valid because minutes should be between 00 and 59. So 8:65 is an incorrect value. The pattern for alarm_time is ^([01]\\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\\d)$, which means minutes must be 00-59. 65 is invalid here.\n\nNext, the forecast_location is New York, which is a valid city name. The pattern allows letters and spaces, so that's okay.\n\nSince the alarm_time has an incorrect value, according to the strategy, I should point out the incorrect parameter. The user's instruction includes the necessary details but the time is invalid. So scenario 1(1) applies here.

{"id": "special_error_param_40", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a plant recommendation for a room with constant sunlight and plans to water it every month. First, I need to check the API parameters. The SustainablePlantGuide requires light_availability and water_frequency. \n\nFor light_availability, the options are low, medium, high. The user said \"constant sunlight,\" which I think translates to high. That's a direct mapping.\n\nThen, water_frequency has options daily, weekly, bi-weekly. The user mentioned \"every month,\" but the API doesn't have a monthly option. The closest longer option is bi-weekly (every two weeks), but that's still more frequent than monthly. Here, the user's input doesn't match the allowed values. So, the water_frequency parameter has an incorrect value. According to the rules, since the user provided a value that doesn't fit the enum, I should flag it. \n\nI need to output the error message as per scenario 2(1). The correct API parameters require water_frequency to be one of the specified enums, but \"monthly\" isn't there. So, the answer should indicate that. Also, light_availability is correctly set to 'high'. \n\nI should make sure not to suggest using bi-weekly as a replacement unless the user clarifies, because the user might have intended a different frequency.

{"id": "special_error_param_41", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to generate a confidential alias using the seed 'My Secret$123'. I need to check the API specifications for the ConfidentialAliasGenerator.\n\nFirst, the parameters required are name_seed and length. The name_seed must be alphanumeric, 5-30 characters, and match the pattern ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$. The user's seed is 'My Secret$123'. Wait, there's a dollar sign in there. The pattern allows only letters and numbers, so the $ is invalid. That's a problem. The length is required but the user didn't specify, so I need to ask for that. Also, the language is optional but they didn't mention it. \n\nSo the main issues are the invalid character in name_seed and the missing length. According to the strategy, since there's an incorrect value for name_seed, I should point that out. Also, missing necessary parameters (length). But the priority is scenario (1) first. The name_seed has an incorrect value because of the $, so output that. Then, missing length. Wait, but the required fields are name_seed and length. So both are missing? Wait, the user provided the seed but it's invalid. So for scenario (1), the seed's value is incorrect. Then also, the length is missing. But according to the priority, first check if scenario (1) applies. The name_seed has an incorrect value, so output that. Then maybe also the length missing. Hmm, the user didn't specify length, which is required. So the response should include both issues. Wait, the strategy says first check scenario (1), which is if the parameters have incorrect types or forms. So the seed's value is invalid because of the $, so that's scenario (1). Then, the length is missing, which is scenario (2). But the priority is to first check scenario (1), then scenario (2). So in the output, I need to mention both? Or which one comes first?\n\nWait, according to the note, steps have priority. So first, check if scenario (1) applies. If it does, output according to (1). If not, proceed to (2). But in this case, scenario (1) applies because the name_seed has an incorrect value. Then, the output should be [\"There is incorrect value (My Secret$123) for the parameters (name_seed) in the conversation history.\"] Then, after that, maybe the missing parameters. Wait, but according to the instructions, the user's message may have both issues. So in this case, the incorrect value for name_seed and missing length. So according to priority, first scenario (1) applies, so output that. Then, after that, if there are missing parameters, maybe in the same response? But the examples in the instructions show that each scenario is handled separately. For example, if a parameter is invalid and another is missing, which one is first?\n\nIn the problem statement, part 2's strategy says: first determine if (1) applies. If it does, output according to (1). If not, then check (2). So here, the name_seed has an invalid value (because of the $), so scenario (1) applies. So output the message for (1). However, the length is also missing. But we need to first address the invalid parameter. Then, after that, if after fixing the seed, the length is still missing. So the output should first point out the incorrect value for name_seed. Then, in a subsequent step, if the user corrects the seed, then we can point out the missing length. But in this step, according to the priority, (1) is first. So the output here should be the message for (1), indicating the invalid value. Then, in the next step, after the user corrects the seed, we can ask for length. But in the current step, the user's message has both issues. So according to the strategy, the first priority is to report (1). So the assistant should output the message for incorrect parameter (name_seed), and then not the missing parameters? Because (1) takes priority.\n\nWait, but the user's request may have both an invalid parameter and missing parameters. For example, the name_seed is invalid and length is missing. So in this case, the invalid parameter (1) is addressed first. So the output would be [\"There is incorrect value (My Secret$123) for the parameters (name_seed) in the conversation history.\"]. The missing parameters would be handled after the user corrects the invalid one. So in this case, the assistant first points out the invalid character in name_seed, then the user fixes it, and then the assistant asks for the missing length.\n\nTherefore, the correct output here is to report the incorrect value for name_seed because of the $, which doesn't match the required pattern of alphanumeric characters only.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (My Secret$123) for the parameters (name_seed) in the conversation history.\"]"}
{"id": "special_error_param_42", "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's look at the user's request. They want a security audit for their email: myemail@com, and the report in JSON format.\n\nFirst, check the available APIs. The EmailSecurityAudit function seems relevant. Its required parameter is 'email', and there's an optional 'audit_report_format' which can be 'json' or 'xml'. The user specified JSON, so that's covered.\n\nThe email provided is myemail@com. Wait, the email pattern in the API requires ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\\\w{2,4}$. The domain part here is 'com', which is okay, but the TLD should be at least 2 characters. 'com' is valid, so the email format looks okay. \n\nOther parameters: check_password_strength and check_2fa_status are optional. The user didn't mention them, so maybe they don't want those checks. But the API allows them as optional. However, the user's request doesn't specify, so should we include them as false or omit? The API's required parameters are only 'email', so others are optional. But the user only mentioned the email and the report format. \n\nSo the necessary parameters are email and audit_report_format. The user provided both, so the API call should be EmailSecurityAudit(email='myemail@com', audit_report_format='json'). \n\nWait, the email might have an issue. Let me check again. The pattern is ^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\\\w{2,4}$. The part after the @ is [\\w\\.-]+\\.\\\\w{2,4}. The domain 'com' would be considered valid because \\w{2,4} matches 2-4 characters. 'com' is 3 characters, so that's okay. So the email is valid.\n\nTherefore, the API call is valid with the given parameters. No missing parameters. The other parameters are optional, so they can be omitted. So the correct API request is EmailSecurityAudit with email and audit_report_format set.\n</think>\n\n[EmailSecurityAudit(email='myemail@com', audit_report_format='json')]"}

The session_id must be a string matching the pattern ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{10,20}$. The user's provided ID is \"study123\", which is only 9 characters long. That doesn't meet the 10-20 character requirement. \n\nNext, the duration is 13 hours. The API specifies a maximum of 12 hours, so 13 is over the limit. \n\nSince both parameters have issues (session_id too short, duration too long), I need to report these incorrect values.

That's a problem because 1999 is below the minimum allowed year of 2000. The month is February, which is '02' in MM format, so that's correct. The language is Spanish, which is one of the allowed enums. However, the year 1999 doesn't meet the API's requirements. So according to the strategy, I should check if there's an incorrect value.

The threat_type is given as 'malware123'. The parameter's description specifies that it should be a valid threat category like 'malware', 'phishing', etc., and the pattern is letters only. 'malware123' includes numbers, which violates the pattern, so that's an issue.\n\nNext, severity_level is supposed to be an integer between 1 and 10. The user provided 'five', which is a word, not a number. This doesn't match the required type. So both parameters have problems. \n\nThe user's instruction lacks correct parameter forms for both threat_type and severity_level.

They want advice on securing their shopping account linked with the email 'myemail@shop@com' and they want it at an advanced level.\n\nFirst, I need to check which API to use. The available APIs include AccountSecurityAdvisor, which fits because it's about securing a shopping account. The parameters required for this API are account_email and security_level. The account_email is a required field, and the security_level is optional but the user specified 'advanced'.\n\nLooking at the account_email parameter, the user provided 'myemail@shop@com'. The API requires a valid email format, which should have exactly one @ symbol. The given email has two, making it invalid. So there's an issue here. The security_level is correctly set to 'advanced', which is part of the enum, so that's fine.\n\nThe problem is the email format. According to the API specifications, the email must match the pattern ^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$. The user's email has an extra @, so it doesn't meet the criteria. \n\nSince the user's instruction includes the key details (email and security level) but the email value is incorrect, we need to point out the incorrect value.

First, I need to check the available API functions.\n\nThe provided API is StainlessSteelUsageGuidelines, which requires parameters heat_source and optionally cooking_style. The heat_source has to be one of gas, electric, or induction. The user mentioned a solar stove, which isn't in the enum list. That's a problem. Also, they mentioned grilling, which isn't one of the allowed cooking styles either (the options are frying, boiling, baking). \n\nSo, the heat_source parameter is required, and \"solar\" isn't a valid value. The cooking_style is optional, but \"grilling\" isn't in the allowed list. Therefore, I need to inform the user that the values they provided are incorrect. According to the guidelines, if the parameter values don't match the API definitions, I should output an error message pointing out the incorrect value and parameter. \n\nIn this case, the heat_source is solar, which is invalid. The cooking_style is grilling, which is also invalid. But since the user included both, but the API only allows certain values, the correct approach is to state that there are incorrect values for the parameters heat_source and cooking_style. However, looking back, the API's cooking_style parameter's enum includes frying, boiling, baking. Grilling isn't listed, so if the user provided that, that's an error. \n\nSo the output should be a list indicating that both parameters have incorrect values. Wait, but the API's required parameter is only heat_source. The cooking_style is optional, so even if the user provides an invalid one, it's still an error. So the response should be [\"There is incorrect value (solar) for the parameters (heat_source) in the conversation history.\", \"There is incorrect value (grilling) for the parameters (cooking_style) in the conversation history.\"]? But the note says if multiple issues, need to list all. But according to the priority, first check if any scenario 1 applies. But in this case, the user's request can't be processed because the parameters are invalid, so scenario 2 applies. Wait, the user's request includes the necessary details (heat_source and cooking_style), but the values don't match. So according to strategy (1), if the parameters have incorrect types or forms, output the error. Therefore, the correct response is to point out the incorrect values. \n\nWait, but the API requires heat_source, so the user provided \"solar\" which is invalid. So the first error. And cooking_style is optional, but the user provided \"grilling\", which is invalid. So both errors. Therefore, the assistant should output both errors. But the example format in the strategy (1) shows multiple entries. So the correct output should be two separate entries in the list. But the user's original input has two issues. So the assistant's response should be a list with two elements: one for each incorrect parameter. However, looking at the example output format given for strategy (1), it's [\"There is incorrect value (value) for the parameters (key) ...\"], so each invalid parameter is listed separately. So in this case, two separate messages. Therefore, the correct answer should be two entries in the list, each pointing out the incorrect value for each parameter.\n</think>\n\n[\"There is incorrect value (solar) for the parameters (heat_source) in the conversation history.\", \"There is incorrect value (grilling) for the parameters (cooking_style) in the conversation history.\"]"}

The required parameters are check_interval, alert_email, and system_id. Also, include_diagnostics is optional.\n\nThe user provided check_interval as 10 minutes, which is within the allowed range (5-60). That's good. The alert_email is given as myemail#domain.com. Wait, the email format requires a valid email. The # symbol isn't standard in emails. The API specifies the email format using a string format, so maybe it's okay, but usually emails don't have #. But according to the API's parameters, the email is a string with the format specified. Wait, the API says 'format': 'email' for alert_email, so the user's input myemail#domain.com is invalid because of the #. That's a problem. The system_id is missing in the user's request. The user didn't mention a system ID at all. So there are two issues: incorrect email format and missing system_id.\n\nAccording to the strategy, first check if there's incorrect parameter values. The alert_email has an invalid format. So we need to point that out. Also, system_id is missing. So both issues are present.\n\nBut the priority is to check for incorrect values first. So the output should mention the incorrect email and the missing system_id. Wait, but the user's instruction says if (1) applies, output that, else check (2). So if there's incorrect parameters, we need to output the incorrect value part. However, the user's request also lacks system_id. So how to handle both?\n\nWait, according to the note, the steps have priority. First check if scenario (1) applies. Scenario (1) is when parameters have incorrect types or forms. Here, the alert_email has an invalid format (contains #), which doesn't fit the email format. So scenario (1) applies here. But system_id is missing, which would be scenario (2). But according to the priority, we check scenario (1) first. Therefore, the output should point out the incorrect email value. However, the user also didn't provide system_id, which is required. But the problem is that both issues exist. But according to the strategy, if there's incorrect value (which there is), we output that. However, the user's input also has missing parameters. Wait, but the system_id is missing, which is a required parameter. So how to handle both?\n\nThe priority is scenario (1) over (2). Scenario (1) is about incorrect parameter values, and scenario (2) is about missing parameters. So in this case, the alert_email has an invalid value (incorrect format), and system_id is missing. Since scenario (1) takes priority, the output should state that there's an incorrect value for alert_email and also missing parameters. Wait, but the strategy says first check if (1) applies. If (1) applies, output according to that. If the user has both incorrect values and missing parameters, but (1) applies, then do (1). However, the user's request has both. But according to the example, perhaps both errors are reported. However, the output format allows for multiple entries. Wait, the output format in case of multiple issues would be a list. For example, if there's both incorrect value and missing parameters, how to handle. But according to the strategy, first check (1) if any parameters have incorrect values. Since the alert_email is invalid, that's scenario (1), so output the error for that. Then, after correcting that, maybe the system_id is missing, but in the current step, the assistant should point out the incorrect value first. Therefore, in this case, the output should mention the incorrect email value and the missing system_id. Wait, but according to the rules, the output should be either (1), (2), or (3). So the assistant must check first for (1). If there's an incorrect value, output that. The missing parameters are part of (2), but since (1) was already triggered, the assistant should only output (1) in this case. Wait, no. The user has both incorrect email and missing system_id. But the priority is to handle scenario (1) first, which is incorrect parameter values. So if any parameters have incorrect types or forms, output the incorrect value. In this case, the alert_email's value doesn't conform to the email format. So the output should be [\"There is incorrect value (myemail#domain.com) for the parameters (alert_email) in the conversation history.\"]. However, the system_id is missing, which is required. So according to the rules, after handling (1), but since the user might have both issues, but the assistant can't proceed to (2) until (1) is resolved. Wait, but the strategy says that the steps have a priority order. So first, check if scenario (1) applies. If yes, output according to (1). So even if there are missing parameters, if the parameters that are present have incorrect values, then output (1). Therefore, the output here is pointing out the alert_email's incorrect value. Then, after the user corrects the email, the next step would be to handle the missing system_id. But in the current step, the assistant must point out the incorrect value first. However, in the conversation history, the user didn't provide system_id. So how to handle both? The problem is that the current scenario has both issues.
