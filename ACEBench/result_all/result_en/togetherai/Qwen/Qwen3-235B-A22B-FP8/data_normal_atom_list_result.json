The parameters required are kidsAges, which is a list of the kids' ages. The user provided ages 5 and 7, so I should include that. The API also allows for optional parameters like interests, parkArea, and dayOfWeek. Since the user mentioned space themes, I should set the interests parameter to something like \"space\". The parkArea is specified as Tomorrowland, so that should be included. The dayOfWeek is this weekend, but the user didn't specify which day, so maybe I can leave that out or set it to a default.\n\nWait, the required parameter is only kidsAges, so the other parameters are optional. But since the user mentioned \"this weekend\", maybe including the dayOfWeek would help, but the API might not require it. However, the user didn't specify Saturday or Sunday, so it's safer to omit it unless the API requires it. The parkArea is specified as Tomorrowland, so that's important to include. The interests are space-related, so that should be added as well.\n\nPutting it all together, the API call should use DisneyRides_recommendForKids with kidsAges [5,7], interests \"space\", parkArea \"Tomorrowland\". The dayOfWeek isn't specified, so maybe leave it out. Let me check the API parameters again. The required parameters are only kidsAges, so the others are optional. Therefore, the correct API call would include those parameters. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, using the parameter names as defined.
