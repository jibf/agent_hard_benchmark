Since the user didn't specify whether to prioritize work, but they want rest periods and leisure, perhaps work_focus should be set to true to ensure work is included in the schedule. Alternatively, maybe it's better to leave it out if it's optional. Wait, the parameters are work_focus (boolean), leisure_activities (required string), and rest_periods (boolean). The user mentioned rest periods, so rest_periods should be true. Leisure activities are given as yoga and reading, so that's the value.

The API's parameters don't specify that work_focus is required, so it's optional. So I should include it if the user's request implies it. Since the user wants to balance work with leisure, perhaps work_focus should be true. Alternatively, maybe the API handles that without it. But to be safe, include work_focus as true. So the API call would have leisure_activities as 'yoga, reading', rest_periods as true, and work_focus as true. Let me check the parameters again. The required parameters are leisure_activities.
