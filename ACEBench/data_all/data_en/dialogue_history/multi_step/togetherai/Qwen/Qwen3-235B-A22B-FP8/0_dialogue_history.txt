Okay, let's see. The user is Eve, and she wants to order a Domino's Super Supreme Pizza from FoodPlatform. She also wants to record her spending in a reminder. The account details are username Eve and password password123.

First, I need to figure out the steps required. To place an order, she probably needs to log in to the food platform first. So the first API call should be login_food_platform with her username and password. Once logged in, she can place the order using add_food_delivery_order. Then, she needs to create a reminder with the spending details. But wait, how much did she spend? The problem doesn't specify the price of the pizza. Maybe the order API will return the cost, but looking at the API definitions, add_food_delivery_order doesn't mention a return value. Hmm, maybe the balance check is needed after placing the order? But check_balance requires a user_name. Alternatively, maybe the order confirmation includes the amount. But according to the given APIs, there's no API to get the order cost. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to record how much she spent today. So perhaps after placing the order, she needs to check her balance to see the deduction. But check_balance takes a user_name. However, the user hasn't mentioned checking the balance before. Alternatively, maybe the price is known, but the problem doesn't state it. This is a bit of a problem. 

But according to the given APIs, there's no API to get the price of an order. So maybe the user expects that the order is placed, and then the reminder is created with the amount, assuming that the amount is known. But since the APIs don't provide a way to get the balance after the order, maybe the user just wants to create the reminder with a placeholder, but the user's instruction says to record the actual spending. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to first check her balance before placing the order, then place the order, then check again to find the difference. But the check_balance API requires a user_name, which is Eve here. So steps would be:

1. Login to FoodPlatform.
2. Check balance before order.
3. Place the order.
4. Check balance again.
5. Calculate the difference (assuming the order cost is the difference).
6. Create a reminder with that amount.

But the user's message says "record how much I spent today", which would be the cost of the pizza. Since the problem doesn't specify the price, maybe the system assumes that the order's cost is known or that the API returns it. However, the given APIs don't include a way to retrieve the order cost. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that after placing the order, the system can automatically record the amount, but without the necessary API, this is unclear. 

Given the constraints, the best approach is to proceed with placing the order and then creating the reminder with a placeholder, but since the user's instruction requires the actual spending, maybe the check_balance is needed. However, the problem might expect that the user's spending is the cost of the pizza, which isn't provided. Alternatively, maybe the check_balance is the way to find out. 

So the steps would be:

1. Call login_food_platform with username Eve and password password123.
2. Then call add_food_delivery_order with username Eve, merchant_name Domino's, and items including Super Supreme Pizza with quantity 1.
3. Then call check_balance with user_name Eve to get the current balance, which would reflect the deduction.
4. Then create a reminder with the amount spent, which is the previous balance minus the current balance. But how to get the previous balance? Maybe another check before placing the order. But this requires multiple steps.

But according to the problem statement, the user wants to record how much she spent. Without knowing the price, perhaps the system expects that the user knows the price, but the problem doesn't state it. Alternatively, maybe the get_products API could be used to find the price of the pizza from Domino's. So:

- Call get_products with merchant_name Domino's to get the product list, find the price of Super Supreme Pizza.
- Then use that price in the reminder.

But the user's instruction doesn't mention checking the product list. The user just wants to order it, so maybe the price is known. However, the problem doesn't provide that info. 

Given the APIs available, the user's request can be partially fulfilled by placing the order and creating the reminder with a placeholder. But since the user specified "how much I spent", the system needs to determine that amount. 

But given the APIs provided, there's no way to retrieve the price of an item or the balance after the order. The check_balance API requires a user_name, which is Eve. So perhaps the steps are:
