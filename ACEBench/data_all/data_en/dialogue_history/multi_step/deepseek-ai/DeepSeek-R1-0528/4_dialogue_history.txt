| 7               | agent      | user                      | 根据用户指令和当前执行状态，收件箱已满需要删除最新消息后才能发送新消息。因此下一步应获取最新消息的ID以便删除：

[get_latest_message_id()]                                                                                                                          |

| 11              | agent      | user                      | 根据对话历史和用户要求，当前需要删除最新消息（ID为4）以释放空间，然后发送消息。下一步调用：
[delete_message(message_id=4)]                                                                                                                          |

| 13              | agent      | user                      | 根据对话历史和用户指令，当消息容量已满时需要删除最新消息。上一步已获取最新消息ID为4，现在应调用delete_message API删除该消息：

[delete_message(message_id=4)]                                                                                                                          |

| 15              | agent      | execution                 | [delete_message(message_id=4)]                                                                                           |

| 17              | agent      | user                      | 根据对话历史和执行结果，收件箱已满的问题已通过删除最新消息（ID=4）解决，Wi-Fi也已开启。现在可以重新尝试发送消息。调用send_message API：

[send_message(sender_name='Eve', receiver_name='Frank', message="Don't forget tomorrow afternoon's meeting")]                                                                                                                          |

| 19              | agent      | execution                 | [send_message(sender_name='Eve', receiver_name='Frank', message="Don't forget tomorrow afternoon's meeting")]            |
| 20              | execution  | agent                     | status: True message: Message successfully sent to Frank.                                                                |
| 21              | agent      | user                      | finish conversation                                                                                                      |
