| 17              | agent      | user                      | The total fare for business class on the two-segment itinerary (MU3561 + CZ1765) is 6 500 CNY.

• MU3561 (Beijing → Nanjing) – Business: 4 000 CNY  
• CZ1765 (Nanjing → Shenzhen) – Business: 2 500 CNY  
————————————————————  
Total: 6 500 CNY

Your current balances are: Cash 1 000 CNY and Bank 5 000 CNY, so the business-class option would exceed the funds available on either single payment method.

The economy-class alternative would be 3 000 CNY total (1 500 CNY per segment).

Gold members like you get 3 free checked bags for economy or business.

Please let me know:
1. Would you like to proceed with economy class at 3 000 CNY, or explore other options?  
2. Which payment method would you like to use (bank or cash)?  
3. How many checked bags will you take (up to 3 free)?                                                                                                                          |
