1) CZ4321  •  July 16 20:00–22:00  
   Economy fare: ¥2 500 (current Business fare you hold is ¥3 000 → a ¥500 refund)

2) CZ4352  •  July 17 20:00–22:00  
   Economy fare: ¥1 600 (refund would be ¥1 400)

Please let me know which flight you’d like to switch to.  
You’ll remain with 1 checked bag, and the refund can go back to your original bank card unless you prefer cash.

Once you confirm the flight choice (and refund method if different), I’ll list all change details for your final “Yes” before processing.                                                                                                                          |
