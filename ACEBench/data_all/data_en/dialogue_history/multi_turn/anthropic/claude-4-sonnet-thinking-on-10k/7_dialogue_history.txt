1. What would you like the title of the reminder to be?
2. What should the content/description of the reminder be?

The reminder time will default to the current time (June 11, 2024, 16:00) unless you specify a different time.                                                                                                                          |

What should the description or content of this reminder be?                                                                                                                          |

Would you like me to try a different approach? I could:
1. Search for specific messages from Eve using the search_messages function
2. Or if you remember the message content, you could provide it directly so I can create the reminder

What would you prefer to do?                                                                                                                          |
| 20              | user       | agent                     | I don't have the message content directly. Could you try searching for specific messages from Eve?                       |
| 21              | agent      | user                      | To search for specific messages from Eve, I need a keyword to search with. What keyword or topic should I search for in  |
|                 |            |                           | Eve's messages? For example, is it about a meeting, project, or some other specific topic?                               |
| 22              | user       | agent                     | Please search for messages related to a meeting.                                                                         |

| 25              | agent      | user                      | Perfect! I found the message from Eve. The message content is: "Hey Frank, don't forget about our meeting on 2024-06-11 at 4 PM in Conference Room 1."
