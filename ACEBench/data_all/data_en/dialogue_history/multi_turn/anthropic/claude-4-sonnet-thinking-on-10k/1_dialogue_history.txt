| 1               | agent      | user                      | I'd be happy to help you send a message to Frank. However, I need some additional information to complete the message:

1. What is your name (the sender's name)?
2. What message would you like to send to Frank?

Please provide both pieces of information so I can send the message for you.                                                                                                                          |

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with? I can assist with sending more messages, adding reminders, or ordering takeout if needed.                                                                                                                          |
