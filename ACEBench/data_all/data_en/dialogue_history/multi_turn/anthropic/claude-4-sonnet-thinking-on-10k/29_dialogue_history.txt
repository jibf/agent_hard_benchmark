Let me try to assist you further. This could be due to a technical issue with the booking system. Here are your options:

1. I can try the booking again with the same details
2. I can help you look for alternative flights
3. I can transfer you to a human agent who can assist with technical issues

Would you like me to attempt the booking again, or would you prefer one of the other options?                                                                                                                          |

| 19              | agent      | user                      | I apologize, but the booking attempt has failed again with the same technical error. Since I've tried twice and encountered the same system issue both times, this appears to be beyond what I can resolve through the automated booking system.

I recommend transferring you to a human agent who can:
- Handle this technical booking issue directly
- Process your reservation manually if needed
- Provide immediate assistance with any system-related problems

The human agent will have your booking details:
- Flight MU3561 (Beijing to Nanjing, July 18th, 08:00-10:00)
- Economy class, bank payment, 4 checked bags
- Total cost: 1,550 yuan

Would you like me to transfer you to a human agent now?                                                                                                                          |
