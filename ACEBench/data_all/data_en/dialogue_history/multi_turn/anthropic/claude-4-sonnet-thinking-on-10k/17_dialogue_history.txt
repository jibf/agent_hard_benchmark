| 29              | agent      | user                      | I apologize, but there seems to be a persistent technical issue with the WiFi connection that's preventing me from logging in to the food delivery platform, despite multiple attempts to turn on WiFi. Even though you've confirmed that WiFi is enabled, the system continues to report that WiFi is not available when I try to log in.

This technical issue is preventing me from completing the first task in your to-do list (placing the food delivery order for Frank at "Hema Fresh").
