| 21              | agent      | user                      | I'm encountering a persistent technical issue where the Wi-Fi connection cannot be established despite multiple attempts to turn it on. The system continues to report that Wi-Fi is turned off, preventing me from sending your message to Frank.

This appears to be a system-level connectivity issue that I cannot resolve through the available functions. You may need to:

1. Manually check your device's Wi-Fi settings
2. Restart your device's network connection
3. Contact technical support if the connectivity issue persists

Once the Wi-Fi connection is properly established, I'll be able to send your message "Are you free tomorrow to have lunch with me?" to Frank. Please let me know when the connectivity issue has been resolved and you'd like me to try sending the message again.                                                                                                                          |
| 22              | user       | agent                     | Okay, I will check the Wi-Fi settings and try again later.                                                               |
| 23              | agent      | user                      | Understood. Please check your Wi-Fi settings and ensure the connection is working properly. Once you have the Wi-Fi issue resolved, feel free to ask me again to send the message to Frank, and I'll be happy to help.
