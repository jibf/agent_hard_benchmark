Since I've completed the takeout order task, let me ask: would you still like me to:

1. Reply to Frank's message to let him know the order has been placed?
2. Add Frank's message content to a reminder?

Or if you're all set with this task, please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.                                                                                                                          |
