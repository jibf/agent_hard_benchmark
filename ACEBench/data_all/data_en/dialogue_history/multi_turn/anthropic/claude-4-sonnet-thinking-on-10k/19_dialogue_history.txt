Without successful device login, I'm unable to access the reminder system to view your 'To-do list' reminder.                                                                                                                          |

1. Ordering groceries
2. Scheduling a meeting
3. Sending an email

Would you like to complete any of these tasks? If so, which one would you like to start with? I can help you with ordering groceries through the food delivery platform if needed, though for scheduling meetings and sending emails, I would need more specific information about what you'd like to accomplish.                                                                                                                          |
