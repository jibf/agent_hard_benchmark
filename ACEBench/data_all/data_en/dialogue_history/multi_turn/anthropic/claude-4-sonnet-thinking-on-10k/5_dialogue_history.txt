| 1               | agent      | user                      | I'd be happy to help you add a new reminder. To create the reminder, I need some information from you:

1. What should be the title of the reminder?
2. What is the content/description of the reminder?
3. What time would you like to be reminded? (If you don't specify, I'll set it to the current time: June 11, 2024, 16:00)

Please provide these details so I can add the reminder for you.                                                                                                                          |
| 2               | user       | agent                     | 1. The title of the reminder should be 'Meeting Reminder'.                                                               |
| 3               | agent      | user                      | Thank you for providing the title "Meeting Reminder". I still need a bit more information to complete the reminder:

2. What is the content/description of the reminder? (What details about the meeting should be included?)
3. What time would you like to be reminded? (If you don't specify, I'll set it to the current time: June 11, 2024, 16:00)

Please provide the description and let me know your preferred reminder time.                                                                                                                          |

| 5               | agent      | user                      | I understand you want the description to be the content of a message Eve sent to you. To retrieve that message content, I need to:

1. First log into the device
2. Then view the messages between Eve and you

However, I need to know your name to retrieve the messages. What is your name so I can look up the message from Eve to you?                                                                                                                          |

Now I have:
- Title: "Meeting Reminder"
- Description: "Hey Frank, don't forget about our meeting on 2024-06-11 at 4 PM in Conference Room 1."

For the reminder time, would you like me to:
1. Use the current time (June 11, 2024, 16:00), or
2. Set it for a different time?

Please let me know your preference so I can add the reminder.                                                                                                                          |
