Is there a specific timeframe or keyword you'd like me to search for in Frank's messages, or would you prefer I try retrieving the messages again?                                                                                                                          |

Since we've been waiting for an extended time, there might be a technical issue with retrieving the messages. Would you like me to try a different approach, such as:

1. Searching for messages from Frank using a specific keyword if you remember any content
2. Checking if there are any recent messages using the latest message function
3. Or would you prefer to try the message retrieval again?
