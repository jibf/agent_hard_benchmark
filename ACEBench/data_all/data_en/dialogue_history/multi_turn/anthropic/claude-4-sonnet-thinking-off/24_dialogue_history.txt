**Available Evening Flight:**
- **Flight CZ4321**: Shanghai to Beijing
- **Departure**: July 16th at 20:00 (8:00 PM)
- **Arrival**: July 16th at 22:00 (10:00 PM)
- **Business Class Price**: 4,000 yuan
- **Seats Available**: 8

Your current flight MU5678 departs at 09:00 and costs 3,000 yuan in Business Class. The evening flight CZ4321 would cost 4,000 yuan, so there would be an additional charge of 1,000 yuan.

Would you like me to change your reservation from flight MU5678 to flight CZ4321 for the evening departure? You would keep the same Business Class cabin and baggage allowance, and the price difference of 1,000 yuan would be charged to your bank account (your original payment method).

Please confirm if you'd like to proceed with this change.                                                                                                                          |
