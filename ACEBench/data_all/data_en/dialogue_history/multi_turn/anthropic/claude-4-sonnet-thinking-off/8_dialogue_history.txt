**Message from Frank:**
"Can you help me order a 'Margherita Pizza' delivery? The merchant is Domino's."

Now I have a few questions for you:

1. Would you like to add this message content to a reminder?
2. Would you like to reply to Frank's message?
3. Since this message involves takeout, would you like to order the Margherita Pizza from Domino's based on Frank's request?                                                                                                                          |

Despite multiple attempts to enable Wi-Fi, the system continues to report that Wi-Fi is not enabled for the platform login.

This technical issue is preventing me from accessing the takeout platform to place the Margherita Pizza order from Domino's as requested by Frank. You may need to manually check your device's Wi-Fi settings or try the order directly through the takeout platform app or website.

Would you like me to help you with anything else in the meantime?                                                                                                                          |

| 25              | agent      | user                      | Based on our conversation, we've completed the main tasks:

1. ✅ Logged into the device successfully
2. ✅ Viewed the messages Frank sent to you
3. ✅ Identified Frank's request for ordering a Margherita Pizza from Domino's
4. ❌ Attempted to place the takeout order but encountered persistent Wi-Fi connectivity issues

Unfortunately, due to the technical Wi-Fi issues preventing login to the food platform, we couldn't complete the pizza order for Frank. You may need to place this order manually through the takeout app or website.

Since there are no other tasks pending and you've indicated you don't need further assistance, I'll conclude our session.
