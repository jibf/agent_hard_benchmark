Could you please check your device's WiFi settings manually to ensure it's properly connected to a network? Once you have a stable WiFi connection, I'll be able to send your message "Are you free tomorrow to have lunch with me?" to Frank.                                                                                                                          |

| 23              | agent      | user                      | I apologize, but there appears to be a persistent technical issue with the WiFi connectivity that I'm unable to resolve through the available system functions. Despite multiple attempts to turn on WiFi and your confirmation that you've established a connection, the system continues to report that WiFi is turned off.

This seems to be a system-level connectivity problem that may require:
- Restarting your device
- Checking if there are any network restrictions
- Contacting technical support

Unfortunately, I cannot send your message to Frank under these current conditions. Once the WiFi connectivity issue is resolved at the system level, I'll be able to help you send the message "Are you free tomorrow to have lunch with me?" to Frank immediately.                                                                                                                          |
| 24              | user       | agent                     | Understood. I will address the WiFi issue separately. Thank you for your assistance.                                     |
| 25              | agent      | user                      | You're welcome! Once you've resolved the WiFi connectivity issue, please feel free to come back and I'll be happy to help you send that message to Frank or assist you with any other tasks.
