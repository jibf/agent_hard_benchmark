I have a few questions for you:

1. Would you like to add this message content to a reminder?
2. Would you like to reply to Frank's message?
3. Since this message involves takeout, would you like to order the food Frank requested (large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread from Pizza Palace)?                                                                                                                          |

Without a working Wi-Fi connection, I cannot log into the food delivery platform to place Frank's order for the large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread from Pizza Palace.

You may need to:
1. Check your device's Wi-Fi settings manually
2. Try placing the order directly through the food delivery app
3. Contact technical support for the Wi-Fi connectivity issue
