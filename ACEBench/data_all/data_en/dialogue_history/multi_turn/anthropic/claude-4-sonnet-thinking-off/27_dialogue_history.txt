Since I was able to book the first flight (MU3561 from Beijing to Nanjing) but encountered repeated errors with the second flight booking, I need to transfer you to a human agent who can:

1. Complete the booking for flight CZ1765 (Nanjing to Shenzhen)
2. Ensure both flights are properly linked as a connecting itinerary
3. Resolve any technical issues with the booking system

The human agent will have access to alternative booking methods and can ensure your complete travel itinerary is properly reserved.

I'll now transfer you to a human agent for assistance with completing your booking.                                                                                                                          |

Transferring you now to a human agent...
