Okay, let's see. The user wants to complete the tasks in the 'To-do list' reminder. The first task is to order two "Fresh Gift Packs" from Hema Fresh. They provided their username and password for the food platform, but the login failed because Wi-Fi wasn't on. I turned on the Wi-Fi, so now the login should work.

So next, I need to log in again with the username 'Eve' and password 'password123'. Once logged in, I can place the order. The items are two "Fresh Gift Packs". The API for adding a food order is add_food_delivery_order, which requires username, merchant_name, and items. The items should be a list of dictionaries with product and quantity. 

Wait, the parameters for add_food_delivery_order: username is 'Eve', merchant_name is 'Hema Fresh', and items is a list containing a dictionary with product 'Fresh Gift Pack' and quantity 2. So the API call should be add_food_delivery_order(username='Eve', merchant_name='Hema Fresh', items=[{'product': 'Fresh Gift Pack', 'quantity': 2}]).

After placing the order, I need to check the total price to send the message to Frank. But the problem is, how do I get the total price? The current APIs don't have a check_order_price function. The reminder's description says to replace the parentheses with the actual amount. Maybe the order confirmation response includes the total price. However, in the given APIs, add_food_delivery_order's response isn't specified. The execution result for add_food_delivery_order isn't provided here. Since the user's instruction requires sending the price, but without an API to get the price, perhaps I need to proceed with the order and assume the price is known, or maybe the system can calculate it. But since the user's message requires the actual amount, maybe the agent needs to have that information. Since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps after placing the order, the system would return the total, but since the API doesn't specify that, I might have to proceed with the order and then ask the user for the price, but the user might not know. Alternatively, maybe the agent can check the balance before and after, but that's not efficient. 

Wait, the user's reminder says to send a message with the price. Since the agent can't compute the price without knowing the product's cost, perhaps the order placement response would include the total. However, in the given APIs, the add_food_delivery_order doesn't return a total price. The execution result for that API isn't provided here. So maybe the agent has to proceed with placing the order and then somehow get the price. But given the current setup, perhaps the agent just needs to place the order and then proceed to send the message with a placeholder, but the user's instruction requires replacing the parentheses with the actual amount. 

Hmm, this is a problem. The agent can't know the price unless the order is placed and the total is returned. Since the APIs don't include a way to get the product price, maybe the agent has to proceed with the order and then use the check_balance API to see the difference. But that's not reliable. Alternatively, maybe the agent can use get_products to get the price of the "Fresh Gift Pack" from Hema Fresh. Let me check the APIs. There's a get_products API that requires merchant_name. So after placing the order, the agent could first get the product's price. Wait, but the order is already placed. Maybe the agent should first get the product's price before placing the order. Let me think.

The user's task is to order two "Fresh Gift Packs" and then send the total price. So the steps are: 1) Get the price of one "Fresh Gift Pack" from Hema Fresh. 2) Calculate total (price * 2). 3) Place the order. 4) Send the message with the total. But the agent can't calculate the total without knowing the price. So the agent needs to first get the product's price using get_products(merchant_name='Hema Fresh'). Then, find the price of "Fresh Gift Pack", multiply by 2, then place the order, then send the message. 

But in the current conversation history, the user hasn't done that. The agent needs to handle this. So after logging in to the food platform, the agent should call get_products to get the price. Let me check the APIs again. The get_products API returns a list of products from a specific merchant. Each product should have a name and price. So the agent can call get_products(merchant_name='Hema Fresh'), find the product named "Fresh Gift Pack", get its price, multiply by 2, then place the order, and then send the message with the total. 

So the next step after turning on Wi-Fi is to log in to the food                                                                                                                          |
