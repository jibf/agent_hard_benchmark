| 1               | agent      | user                      | To add a new reminder, I need the **title** of the reminder, its **description** (content), and the **time** (if differe |

| 3               | agent      | user                      | The user has provided the title "Meeting Reminder" but has not specified the description/content or the time for the reminder. According to the rules, adding a reminder requires obtaining the **content** (description) and optionally the **time** (defaults to current time if not provided). 

The agent needs to ask the user for the missing information:  
"Please provide the description/content for the 'Meeting Reminder' and specify the time if it's different from the current time (2024-06-11 16:00)."                                                                                                                          |
