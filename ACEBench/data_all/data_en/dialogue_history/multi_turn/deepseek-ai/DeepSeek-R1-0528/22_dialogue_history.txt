| 15              | agent      | user                      | The flight CA1234 from Beijing to Shanghai on July 15th at 08:00 is currently departing and cannot be booked. Would you like to:
1. Book a later flight on July 15th (if available)?
2. Change your departure date?
3. Consider a connecting flight to Shanghai?

Please provide your preference so I can adjust your booking.                                                                                                                          |
| 16              | user       | agent                     | Book a later flight on July 15th, if available.                                                                          |
| 17              | agent      | user                      | Based on the conversation history and current constraints:

1. The user requested a later flight on July 15th from Beijing to Shanghai
2. Our latest flight search showed only one available flight (CA1234) for this route, which is departing now and unavailable
3. No other direct flights are available for July 15th based on system data

Next step requires user decision since:
- No later direct flights exist for July 15th
- Connecting flights would require a layover city (not specified)
- Date change would require new departure date confirmation

Agent response:
I apologize, but there are no available later direct flights from Beijing to Shanghai on July 15th. Would you like to:
1. Change your departure date (e.g., to July 16th)
2. Book a connecting flight? If so, please specify a preferred layover city

Please advise how you'd like to proceed.                                                                                                                          |
