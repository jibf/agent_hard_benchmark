| 11              | agent      | user                      | The information provided is incomplete for adding the reminder. While we have the title ('Meeting Reminder') and know the description should come from a message Eve sent to Frank, we lack the specific message content to use as the description. The previous API call retrieved all messages between Eve and Frank, but the user hasn't specified which exact message to extract for the reminder.  

Please clarify:  
- Which specific message from Eve should be used? (Provide message ID or unique keywords from the content)  
- Or would you like to use the most recent message?  

Once identified, we can proceed with adding the reminder using the message content as the description.                                                                                                                          |
