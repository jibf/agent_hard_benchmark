| 5               | agent      | user                      | To retrieve the message content from Eve for your reminder description, I need two pieces of information:
1. Your full name (as the message recipient)
2. Any identifying details about the message (e.g., keyword, approximate date/time, or specific context)

Please provide these details so I can locate the correct message.                                                                                                                          |

| 7               | agent      | user                      | To retrieve the specific message from Eve for your reminder description, I need more precise details about the message. Please provide either:
1. An exact phrase from the message content
2. The date or time period when the message was sent
3. Any unique keywords beyond "meeting" to narrow the search

This will help locate the correct message efficiently.                                                                                                                          |

1. An exact keyword or phrase from the message content (e.g., "project deadline" or "room 305")
2. The exact date/time when the message was sent (e.g., "yesterday morning" or "June 10 at 3 PM")
3. Specific details about the meeting mentioned in the message (e.g., "budget review meeting" or "client presentation")                                                                                                                          |
