- User ID and password (for authentication)  
- Cabin class (economy or business for both flights)  
- Payment method (bank or cash)  
- Number of checked bags (same for both flights)  

Since these details are missing, the next step is to request them from the user.  

**Output for step t+1:**

- Economy: 3000 yuan (1500 + 1500)  
- Business: 6500 yuan (4000 + 2500)  

Before proceeding, explicit confirmation is required for:  
1. Cabin class choice (economy/business)  
2. Agreement to book both flights (MU3561 and CZ1765) with specified details  

**Output for step t+1:**  
"Please confirm your cabin class choice: economy (3000 yuan) or business (6500 yuan)? Also, confirm 'Yes' to book flights MU3561 (Beijing-Nanjing) and CZ1765 (Nanjing-Shenzhen) with 1 checked bag, paid by bank."                                                                                                                          |
