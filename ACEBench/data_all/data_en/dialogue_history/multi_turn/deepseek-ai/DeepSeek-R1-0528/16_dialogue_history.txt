| 3               | agent      | user                      | Based on the conversation history and the reminder content retrieved, the next required action is to ask the user if they want to complete the tasks outlined in the reminder. The tasks include:  
1. Placing a food delivery order at "Hema Fresh" for two "Fresh Gift Packs"  
2. Sending a message to Frank with the actual price of the goods (after ordering)  

Following the rule that states: *"After viewing a specific reminder by title, you need to ask the user if they want to complete the tasks within it,"* the agent must now prompt the user for confirmation.  

**Output for step t+1:**  
Do you want to complete the tasks in the reminder "To-do list"?                                                                                                                          |
