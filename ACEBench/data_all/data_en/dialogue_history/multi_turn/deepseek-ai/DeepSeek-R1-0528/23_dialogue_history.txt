| 1               | agent      | user                      | To proceed with changing your flight from Shanghai to Beijing to an evening departure, I need the following information:

1. Your user ID and password to access your reservation
2. The reservation ID for your current Shanghai-Beijing flight
3. Do you have a specific evening flight number in mind? If not, I'll need to search available options after verifying your details.

Please provide your user ID and password first.                                                                                                                          |
