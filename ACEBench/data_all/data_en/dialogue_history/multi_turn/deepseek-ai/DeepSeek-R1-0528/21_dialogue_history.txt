| 3               | agent      | user                      | I need to clarify your travel dates for the round-trip booking. Please provide:  
1. The specific departure date for your outbound flight from Shanghai to Beijing.  
2. The specific departure date for your return flight from Beijing to Shanghai (you mentioned flexibility on July 16th or 17th; please choose one exact date).  

Additionally, confirm that the return flight is from Beijing to Shanghai (not Shanghai to Beijing, as previously stated).                                                                                                                          |

1. Your outbound route is **Shanghai to Beijing**, but you stated the return flight is also from **Shanghai to Beijing**. This appears contradictory.  
   - Confirm the correct return route: Should it be **Beijing to Shanghai**?  
   - If your return is indeed from Shanghai to Beijing, explain the purpose (e.g., two separate one-way trips).

2. Specify exact dates for both flights:  
   - Outbound: July 16 or 17 (choose one)  
   - Return: Provide your preferred return date after the outbound.

3. Confirm your membership level (regular/silver/gold) to determine free baggage allowance.                                                                                                                          |
