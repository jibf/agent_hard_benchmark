1. The message content involves takeout ("Margherita Pizza" from Domino's)
2. After viewing messages, the agent must:
   - Ask about adding to reminders
   - Ask about replying
   - Ask about ordering takeout

Therefore, the next system response should be:

Here is the message from Frank: "Can you help me order a 'Margherita Pizza' delivery? The merchant is Domino's."  
Would you like to:  
1. Add this message to a reminder?  
2. Reply to Frank?  
3. Order this takeout from Domino's?                                                                                                                          |
