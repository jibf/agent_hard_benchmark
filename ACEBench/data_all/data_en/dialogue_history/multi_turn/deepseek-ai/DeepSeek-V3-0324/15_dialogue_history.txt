| 5               | agent      | user                      | Since the user initially requested to view messages from Frank but later provided login credentials for a food platform, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a change in the user's request. However, based on the initial request to view messages from Frank, the next step is to proceed with viewing those messages.
