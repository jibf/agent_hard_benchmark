Okay, let's see. The user wants to view the messages Frank sent to them. First, I need to check the API requirements for viewing messages.

Looking at the API list, there's 'view_messages_between_users' which requires sender_name and receiver_name. The user mentioned Frank as the sender, but who is the receiver? The user is the one receiving the messages, so the receiver_name should be the user's name. But the user didn't specify their own name here. Wait, the role descriptions say "Names mentioned by the user are the user's full names." So maybe the user's name is implied as the receiver. However, the API requires both sender and receiver.

Wait, the user said "Frank sent to me," so the receiver is the user. But the API needs the receiver's name. Since the user hasn't provided their own name, maybe the system assumes the user's name is known? Or do I need to ask for clarification?

Wait, the rules state: "Before viewing text messages, the agent must first obtain the sender and recipient of the messages." The user provided the sender (Frank), but the recipient is the user. However, the API requires both parameters. The user's name might be stored in the system, but according to the problem statement, we can't assume that. The user hasn't mentioned their own name here. Wait, the user is the one interacting, so maybe the recipient is the user's name, but since it's not provided, do I need to ask?

Wait, the conversation history is only the user saying "Yes, I need to view the messages Frank sent to me." So the sender is Frank, receiver is the user. But the API requires both sender_name and receiver_name. The user hasn't specified their own name, but maybe in the context of the system, the user's name is known. However, according to the problem statement, we can't assume any information not provided by the user. Wait, the role descriptions say "Names mentioned by the user are the user's full names." So if the user hasn't mentioned their own name, perhaps the system needs to know it. But in this case, the user is the recipient, so maybe the receiver_name is the user's name, which hasn't been provided here.

Wait, but the user is the one making the request, so maybe the receiver_name is implicitly the user. However, the API requires it as a parameter. The problem is that the user hasn't stated their own name. But according to the rules, when information is incomplete, we need to ask the user for more details.

Wait, the user said "Frank sent to me," so "me" refers to the user. But the API needs the receiver_name as a string. Since the user hasn't provided their own name, the system might not know it. Therefore, the agent needs to ask for the receiver's name, which is the user's name. But the user is the receiver, so maybe the agent should use the user's name as provided in the system. However, the problem states that we can't assume any information not given by the user.

Wait, the initial problem statement says: "Names mentioned by the user are the user's full names." So if the user hasn't mentioned their own name, perhaps it's not available. Therefore, to call view_messages_between_users, we need both sender_name (Frank) and receiver_name (user's name). Since the user hasn't provided their own name, the agent must ask for it.

Wait, but maybe in the context of the conversation, the user is the current user, so the receiver_name is the user's name, which is known to the system. However, according to the problem's instructions, we can't assume any information not provided by the user. The user hasn't stated their own name here, so the agent doesn't have it. Therefore, the agent needs to ask the user for their name to fill in the receiver_name parameter.

Wait, but the user said "Frank sent to me," so "me" is the user. The agent should know that the receiver is the user, but the API requires the receiver_name as a string. If the system doesn't have the user's name stored, then the agent needs to ask. However, the problem states that "Names mentioned by the user are the user's full names." Since the user hasn't mentioned their own name, perhaps the agent doesn't have it. Therefore, the agent must ask for the receiver's name.

Wait, but the user is the one making the request, so maybe the receiver_name is implied as the current user. However, the API requires it as a parameter, so the agent needs to have that value. If the system doesn't have it, the agent must ask. But the problem says "Names mentioned by the user are the user's full names,"                                                                                                                          |
