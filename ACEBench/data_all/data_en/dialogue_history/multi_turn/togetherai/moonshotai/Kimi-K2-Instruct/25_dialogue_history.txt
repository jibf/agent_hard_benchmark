Once I have this information, I can look up your current booking and help you change to the next evening's flight and switch to economy class.                                                                                                                          |

| 5               | agent      | user                      | I found your reservations. You have two bookings:

1. **Reservation res_1**: Beijing to Shanghai on CA1234 (Economy Class) - departing July 15 at 8:00 AM
2. **Reservation res_2**: Shanghai to Beijing on MU5678 (Business Class) - departing July 16 at 9:00 AM

Based on your request to change your flight from Shanghai to Beijing to the next evening and switch to economy class, I believe you're referring to **reservation res_2** (Shanghai to Beijing on MU5678).

To proceed with the modification, I need to:
1. Change the flight from MU5678 (departing July 16 at 9:00 AM) to the next evening flight
2. Change the cabin from Business Class to Economy Class

Let me first search for available evening flights from Shanghai to Beijing on July 16.                                                                                                                          |

| 9               | agent      | user                      | I found the available flights from Shanghai to Beijing. Here are the evening options:

1. **CZ4321** - July 16 at 8:00 PM, arriving 10:00 PM (Economy: ¥2,500)
2. **CZ4352** - July 17 at 8:00 PM, arriving 10:00 PM (Economy: ¥1,600)

Since you mentioned "next evening," I assume you're referring to **July 16 evening** (CZ4321 at 8:00 PM).

**Modification Summary for Reservation res_2:**
- Change flight from: MU5678 (July 16, 9:00 AM) 
- Change flight to: CZ4321 (July 16, 8:00 PM)
- Change cabin from: Business Class to Economy Class
- Additional baggage: 0 (keeping current 1 bag)
- Payment method: bank (for any fare difference)

The new economy fare is ¥2,500 vs your original business fare of ¥3,000, so you would receive a refund of ¥500.
