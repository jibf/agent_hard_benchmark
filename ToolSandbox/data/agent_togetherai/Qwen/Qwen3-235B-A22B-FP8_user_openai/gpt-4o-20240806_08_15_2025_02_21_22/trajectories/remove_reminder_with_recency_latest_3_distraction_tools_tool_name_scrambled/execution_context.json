Since they mentioned \"upcoming,\" I should search for reminders that are scheduled to happen soon. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided specific details like the content, date, or location of the reminder. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's reminder_3 which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. But without specific info, I can't use exact matches. Maybe I can use the creation_timestamp_upperbound to find reminders created recently, but that's not the same as upcoming. The reminder_timestamp_upperbound could be useful if I can determine the time frame for \"upcoming.\" \n\nWait, the user might not know the exact details, so I might need to ask for clarification. However, the user's instruction says not to make assumptions and to ask if the request is ambiguous. Since \"upcoming\" is vague, I should probably prompt the user to provide more details like the content, date, or time of the reminder. But the assistant is supposed to use the functions provided. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the current timestamp from utilities_2 and set a range for the reminder_timestamp_upperbound. For example, find reminders that are set to trigger within the next day. But without knowing the user's timezone or the exact time frame, this might not be accurate. \n\nWait, the functions require specific parameters. If I can't get enough info from the user's message, I should ask for clarification. The user's query is ambiguous because \"upcoming\" isn't specific. So the correct approach is to ask them to provide more details about the reminder they want to remove, like the content, date, time, or location. That way, I can use the reminder_3 function with the appropriate criteria to find the correct reminder and then use reminder_2 to delete it by its ID. \n\nSo, the next step is to inform the user that I need more information to identify the specific reminder. I should ask them to provide details like the reminder's content, date, time, or location so I can proceed accurately.\n</think>\n\nTo remove your upcoming reminder, I need more specific details to identify which reminder you're referring to. Could you provide additional information such as the **content**, **date/time**, or **location** associated with the reminder? This will help me locate and remove the correct entry.",

Let me think through how to handle this.\n\nFirst, when the user initially asked, I requested more info like content, date/time, or location. They couldn't provide anything else, so I needed to find another way.\n\nIn the first attempt, I called utilities_2 to get the current timestamp. That gave me 1755245930.200728. Then, I used reminder_3 with that timestamp as the lower bound for the reminder time. But the result was an empty list, meaning no reminders were found that match.\n\nNow, I need to figure out why no reminders were found. Maybe the user's upcoming reminder isn't in the future? Or maybe the search parameters were too strict. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThe reminder_3 function allows searching with lower and upper bounds for creation and reminder timestamps. Since the user said \"upcoming,\" the reminder timestamp should be in the future. But using the current time as the lower bound would include reminders set for now or later. However, if there are no such reminders, the list is empty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a reminder that's already past, but they didn't realize it. Or perhaps they have no reminders at all. Since the search returned nothing, I need to inform them that there are no upcoming reminders based on the current data.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any reminders at all. If I search without any parameters, would that return all reminders? However, the reminder_3 function requires at least one parameter. Since the required array is empty, maybe passing no parameters would return all, but the user's initial request was for \"upcoming,\" so maybe I should adjust the search criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reminder is in the past. Let me try using the current timestamp as the upper bound to check for reminders before now. But the user said \"upcoming,\" so that might not make sense. However, if they have a reminder that's scheduled but not yet triggered, maybe the system hasn't deleted it yet.\n\nWait, the user might not know the exact details, so perhaps the best approach is to inform them that no upcoming reminders were found and suggest checking if they have any reminders set. Alternatively, offer to show all reminders if possible.\n\nBut given the tools available, since the first search returned nothing, I should let the user know that there are no reminders scheduled after the current time. Maybe also check if they want to look for past reminders, but that's not what they asked for. Alternatively, confirm if they want to proceed with removing any existing reminders, but without data, that's tricky.\n\nIn the response, I should state that no upcoming reminders were found based on the current timestamp. Advise them to check their reminder list or provide more details if they believe there's an error. That makes sense.\n</think>\n\nNo upcoming reminders were found in your list. This could mean either:\n- You don't have any reminders scheduled for the future\n- The reminder might have already been completed or deleted\n\nWould you like me to check for reminders with different criteria (e.g., past reminders, all reminders)?",

                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to help the user remove their upcoming reminder when they don't have any more information on it. \n\nFirst, the user initially asked to remove their upcoming reminder but couldn't provide specific details like the reminder ID, content, or time. The assistant tried to get the current timestamp using utilities_2 to search for reminders after that time, but that returned an empty list. Then, the assistant attempted to search for all reminders with a very broad range (from 0 to a very high timestamp), but that caused an error because the lower bound was too low.\n\nNext, the assistant tried to shift the current timestamp by 52 weeks to set an upper bound, hoping to find reminders within the next year. However, that search also returned an empty list. Now, the user is asking the tools to figure it out themselves if possible.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the user doesn't have any info, and the previous attempts to search for reminders with different time ranges didn't find anything. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about the available functions again.\n\nThe reminder_3 function allows searching by various criteria: reminder_id, content, creation timestamps, reminder timestamps, and location. Since the user doesn't have the reminder ID, content, or location, maybe we can check if there are any reminders at all by leaving most parameters empty except for a time range. But earlier attempts with time ranges didn't work.\n\nWait, the error occurred when the lower bound was too low. The valid minimum for reminder_timestamp_lowerbound is 315529200.0 (which is around 1980). So maybe trying a more reasonable time range. Let's get the current timestamp again and search for reminders in the future, perhaps extending a bit more than a year?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a reminder that's already past. The initial search for upcoming reminders used the current timestamp, but maybe the reminder is in the past. The user said \"upcoming,\" but maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, the user hasn't confirmed that.\n\nWait, the first attempt after getting the current timestamp (1755245930.200728) was to search for reminders with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound as that current timestamp, which returned nothing. Then, after expanding the upper bound to 52 weeks later, still nothing. So maybe there are no upcoming reminders. But the user insists they have one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a reminder but it's not in the future. Maybe the reminder's timestamp is in the past, so the upcoming reminder isn't actually scheduled. Or maybe the system doesn't have any reminders set. \n\nThe assistant should inform the user that no reminders were found even after expanding the search range. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no upcoming reminders to remove. The user might need to check if they actually set a reminder or if it was already completed or deleted. \n\nBut the user's last message says to use the tools to figure it out. Since all attempts to search have failed, maybe the answer is that there are no reminders to remove. So the assistant should confirm that no reminders were found and suggest checking if one exists.\n</think>\n\nNo reminders were found in your list, even after expanding the search window to cover the next year. This suggests there are no upcoming reminders to remove. The system doesn't have any reminder entries matching your request.\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Confirm if you want to check for **past reminders** (reminders that were scheduled before now)?\n2. Or are you certain a reminder exists and would like to try another search strategy?",
