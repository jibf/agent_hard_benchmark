Then I disabled low battery mode and tried turning Wi-Fi on again. This time it worked.\n\nThen I used search_stock again with \"Apple\" and got the response. The response shows the symbol is AAPL. The stock is listed on NASDAQ, price is $232.78, and other details. \n\nNow I need to present the answer clearly. The user specifically asked for the stock symbol, so I'll mention AAPL first. Maybe add the exchange and price as extra info since it's helpful. Keep it concise and friendly.\n</think>\n\nThe stock symbol for Apple is **AAPL**, traded on the NASDAQ. The current price is $232.78 (USD), with a slight decrease of -0.55 today. Let me know if you'd like more details! 📈",
