                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. But wait, the current date isn't provided. Should I use the current timestamp first? Let me check the available functions. There's get_current_timestamp which can get the current time. Then, using shift_timestamp to add days or weeks to get to next Friday. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to parse the date directly, but the functions available don't include a date parsing function except datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires explicit year, month, day, etc. Since the user said \"next Friday\", which can be ambiguous depending on the current day. \n\nLet me outline the steps. Maybe first get the current timestamp, then calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. For example, if today is Monday, next Friday is 4 days away. But I need to account for that. Alternatively, the shift_timestamp function can add days. But how to determine how many days to add? Hmm, but the user might not have provided the current date, so the assistant needs to use the current timestamp to compute that. \n\nWait, but the functions don't have a way to find the weekday of the current timestamp. Wait, there's timestamp_to_datetime_info, which includes isoweekday. So the steps could be: get current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to find the current weekday, then calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday (isoweekday 3), then next Friday is 2 days later. If today is Friday (isoweekday 5), then next Friday would be in 7 days. Wait, the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday, not the same day if today is Friday. So if today is Friday, then next Friday would be 7 days later. \n\nBut this requires several function calls. Let me think. First, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current day of the week. Then calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. Then use shift_timestamp to add those days plus the time difference (from current time to 5 PM). \n\nWait, but the user specified 5 PM. So regardless of the current time, the reminder should be at 5 PM on next Friday. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and isoweekday.\n3. Calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. For example, if current isoweekday is 3 (Wednesday), add 2 days. If it's 5 (Friday), add 7 days. If it's 6 (Saturday), add 6 days. So the formula would be: days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. Wait, because if today is Friday (5), (5-5+7) mod7 is 0, so days_to_add is 0. But the user said \"next Friday\", which would mean not today, but the next one. So in that case, if today is Friday, days_to_add should be 7. Hmm, maybe adjust the formula. Let's see:\n\nIf isoweekday is the current day (1=Monday, ..., 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday).\n\nWe need to find days_to_add such that (current isoweekday + days_to_add) % 7 == 5. But since we want the next occurrence, not including today if it's Friday.\n\nWait, but \"next Friday\" could be interpreted as the first Friday after today. So if today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days. So the calculation would be:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7\n\nBut if the result is 0, then add 7. Wait, let's test:\n\nIf isoweekday is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7) mod7 =0. So days_to_add would be 0. But we need to add 7 days to get to next Friday. So maybe adjust the formula to days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7, then if days_to_add is 0, set to 7. Alternatively, days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7, and if days_to_add ==0, add 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7, and then add 7 days if today is Friday. Or maybe it's easier to code:\n\nIf current isoweekday <5: days_to_add = 5 - current isoweekday\n\nIf current isoweekday ==5: days_to_add =7\n\nIf current isoweekday >5: days_to_add = (5 + 7 - current isoweekday)\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent isoweekday is 3 (Wednesday): 5-3=2 days.\n\ncurrent is 5 (Friday): 7 days.\n\ncurrent is 6 (Saturday): 5 +7 -6 =6 days.\n\ncurrent is 7 (Sunday):5+7-7=5 days.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nSaturday (6): 6 days added would bring to Friday? Let's see: Saturday +6 days = Friday? Wait, Saturday (6) + 1 day = Sunday (7), +2=Monday (1), +3=Tuesday (2), +4=Wednesday (3), +5=Thursday (4), +6=Friday (5). Yes. So that works.\n\nSo formula:\n\nif current_day =5 (Friday), days_to_add =7\n\nelif current_day <5: days_to_add =5 - current_day\n\nelse (current_day >5): days_to_add =5 +7 - current_day\n\nBut how to implement this when the functions don't have conditional logic. So the assistant has to do this logic.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime info, including isoweekday.\n\nThen, compute days_to_add as per above logic.\n\n3. Then, shift the current_ts by days_to_add days, and set the time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would take us to the next Friday, but the current time is, say, 10 AM. We need to set the time to 5 PM, so after shifting days, we need to adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So perhaps:\n\nshift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, then shift hours and minutes to reach 17:00:00.\n\nBut current time's hour, minute, second may be non-zero, so perhaps:\n\ntimestamp_after_days_shift = current_ts + days_to_add * 86400 seconds (but via shift_timestamp function, adding days_to_add days).\n\nThen, adjust the hour, minute, second to 17:00:00. But how?\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by weeks, days, hours, etc. So maybe:\n\nAfter getting current_ts, shift by days_to_add days, then shift by (17 - current_hour) hours, (0 - current_minute) minutes, (0 - current_second) seconds.\n\nBut that could be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps after shifting days_to_add days, the time would be same as current time, so to set it to 5 PM, we need to add (17 - current_hour)*3600 + (0 - current_minute)*60 + (0 - current_second) seconds. But that's not possible with the shift_timestamp function, since you can't directly set the time, only shift by deltas. So if current time is 10 AM, then to get to 5 PM same day, you add 7 hours.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Shift days_to_add days to get to next Friday.\n\n- Then shift hours to reach 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to calculate the delta hours, minutes, seconds.\n\nAssuming that after shifting days, the time is the same as the current time. So for example, if current time is 10 AM on Monday, and days_to_add is 2 (to get to Wednesday), the shifted timestamp would be 10 AM on Wednesday. Then we need to shift by (17 - 10) hours = +7 hours, and set minutes and seconds to 0. But if the current time's minutes and seconds are non-zero, perhaps we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nBut this could be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the user wants exactly 5 PM, regardless of current time. So perhaps:\n\nThe final timestamp should be the next Friday at 17:00:00 (5 PM) in the user's local time.\n\nBut how to compute that with the available functions.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nIf we can get the current datetime info, then compute the desired date (next Friday) with year, month, day, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then use datetime_info_to_timestamp to convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to get the date of next Friday.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let's think.\n\nFrom the current datetime info:\n\nyear, month, day, is",
