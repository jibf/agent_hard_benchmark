The available functions are search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, search_holiday, and unit_conversion. \n\nThe user wants the temperature, which isn't directly covered by any of these functions. The unit_conversion function can convert units, but we need the current temperature data first. The location-based functions might help find the address or coordinates of Grand Canyon, but without a weather API or temperature data function, I can't retrieve the actual temperature. \n\nWait, the tools don't include a weather or temperature lookup function. The search_location_around_lat_lon might give information about the location, but not the current temperature. The unit conversion is only useful if we have a temperature value to convert. \n\nSince there's no function available to get the current temperature data, I should inform the user that I can't provide that information with the current tools. Maybe suggest that they check a weather service or app for real-time temperature.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time temperature data or weather information. You may want to check a weather service or website like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your device's built-in weather app for current conditions at Grand Canyon. Would you like me to help convert temperature units if you get a reading in Celsius?"

For current temperature information, checking a weather service like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or a dedicated weather app would be the best approach.

The user's last message was just confirming that they can't access live data. \n\nI should acknowledge their confirmation and reiterate that I can help with unit conversions if they provide a Celsius value. Since there's no function to get the current temperature, I can't use any tool here. Just a polite response to their message.\n</think>\n\nYou're correct that I can't access live weather data.
