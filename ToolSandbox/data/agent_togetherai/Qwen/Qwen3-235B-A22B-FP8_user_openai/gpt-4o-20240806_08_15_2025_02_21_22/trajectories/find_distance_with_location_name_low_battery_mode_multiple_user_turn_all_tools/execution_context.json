The user probably hasn't enabled it. I should check if the location service is active. Wait, there's a function called get_location_service_status. Maybe I should call that first to see if it's enabled. But the user's question is about finding the bridge, so maybe the best approach is to prompt them to enable location services. Alternatively, if I can get the current location, but that also requires location service. \n\nWait, the error message says \"PermissionError: Location service is not enabled.\" So the function requires location service to be on. Since the user hasn't enabled it, I can't proceed with the search. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that location services need to be enabled to find the Golden Gate Bridge.

Let me think about how to respond.\n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their understanding. They're taking the correct step by turning on location services. Maybe I can confirm that enabling it will allow the search to work. But wait, do I need to check if they need help with how to enable it? The error message was a PermissionError, so maybe their device requires permission to access location data. \n\nI should make sure they know that once they enable location services, they can try the search again. Also, perhaps mention that if they have any issues enabling it, I can guide them through the process. But since the user hasn't asked for further help yet, maybe keep it brief. Just a confirmation that enabling location services should resolve the issue and allow them to find the bridge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe offer additional information about the Golden Gate Bridge in case they can't enable location services right now. But the user specifically asked where it is, so the main goal is to help them find it once location is on. \n\nI should also check if there's another function I can use. The user might not need to search again if I can provide the location directly. Wait, but the tools available include search_location_around_lat_lon, which requires location services. If the user can't enable it, maybe use another method? But according to the tools, without location services, functions like get_current_location won't work. \n\nSo the key is to confirm that enabling location services is the correct step. Therefore, my response should be positive and encouraging, letting them know that once enabled, the search will work. Keep it simple and supportive.\n</think>\n\nGreat! Once you enable location services, I can help you find the Golden Gate Bridge's location. Let me know when you're ready to proceed!",
