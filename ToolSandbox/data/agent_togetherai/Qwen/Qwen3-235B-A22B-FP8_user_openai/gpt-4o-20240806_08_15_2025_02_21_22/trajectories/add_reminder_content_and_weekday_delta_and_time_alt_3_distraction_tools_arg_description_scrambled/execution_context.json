                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the timestamp for next Friday at 17:00 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24-hour time). But wait, what date is next Friday? The user didn't specify the date, just \"next Friday\". So I need to calculate that based on the current date.\n\nTo get next Friday's date, I can start with today's date. Let's say today is Monday, then next Friday would be in 5 days. But since the exact current date isn't provided, maybe I should use a function to get the current timestamp and then find the next Friday. However, the available tools don't have a function to directly calculate the next Friday. Hmm.\n\nWait, the tools do have the 'timestamp_to_datetime_info' function which can give the current day of the week. Let me think. The steps might be:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp using 'get_current_timestamp'.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to find out what day of the week it is.\n3. Calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, then next Friday is in 2 days. If today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days.\n4. Add the necessary days to the current timestamp to get next Friday's date at midnight. Then add 17 hours to get to 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to shift the timestamp directly. Wait, there's a 'shift_timestamp' function. But how to determine how many days to shift to reach next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the 'datetime_info_to_timestamp' function. Once I know the current date, I can compute the next Friday's date and then convert that date and time to a timestamp.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use 'get_current_timestamp' to get the current timestamp.\n2. Use 'timestamp_to_datetime_info' with that timestamp to get the current year, month, day, isoweekday, etc.\n3. Calculate the number of days needed to reach next Friday. For example, if isoweekday is 5 (Friday), then next Friday is 7 days later. If it's 3 (Wednesday), then 2 days later.\n4. Add those days to the current timestamp using 'shift_timestamp' to get the date at midnight of next Friday. Then shift again by 17 hours to set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but shifting by days would be straightforward. Let's say today is Monday (isoweekday 1), so to get next Friday (isoweekday 5), need to add 4 days. If today is Friday, add 7 days. If it's Saturday, add 6 days, etc.\n\nSo the formula is: days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If current is Friday (5), (5-5 +7)%7=0%7=0, so add 7 days. If current is Saturday (6), (5-6 +7)=6, so add 6 days. That seems right.\n\nOnce I calculate days_to_add, I can shift the current timestamp by that many days, then add 17 hours.\n\nBut how to do that with the functions available?\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp. Then convert to datetime info to find the isoweekday.\n\nBut the functions don't allow calculations, so I need to compute days_to_add based on the isoweekday from the datetime info.\n\nOnce days_to_add is known, use shift_timestamp with days=days_to_add and hours=17 to set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but shifting days and then hours. Wait, shifting by days and then hours would add to the timestamp. For example, if the current timestamp is midnight on Monday, adding 4 days would take it to midnight on Friday, then adding 17 hours would be 5 PM on Friday.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime info, including isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add: (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. If the result is 0, add 7 days to get to next Friday.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nIf isoweekday is 5 (Friday), (5-5 +7) =7, mod7=0. So days_to_add is 0? Then adding 0 days would be same day, but we want next Friday. So in that case, need to add 7 days. Hmm, so perhaps days_to_add should be (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7, but if the result is 0, add 7. Wait, but (5 - isoweekday +7) %7 for Friday would be (0 +7) mod7=0, but 0 mod7 is 0. So days_to_add=0, which would mean adding 0 days. That's not correct. Because if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later. So the formula should be days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, then add 7 days. Wait, but (5 - isoweekday) when isoweekday is 5 gives 0, then +7 gives 7, mod7 is 0. So days_to_add would be 0. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: find the difference in days to next Friday.\n\nIf today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nThe formula should be:\n\nif current isoweekday <5: days_to_add=5 - current_isoweekday\n\nif current isoweekday ==5: days_to_add=7\n\nif current isoweekday >5: days_to_add= (5 +7 - current_isoweekday)\n\nWait:\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent isoweekday=1 (Monday): 5-1=4 days to add.\n\ncurrent isoweekday=5 (Friday): 7 days.\n\ncurrent isoweekday=6 (Saturday): 5 +7 -6=6 days.\n\ncurrent isoweekday=7 (Sunday):5 +7 -7=5 days.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo days_to_add is:\n\nif current_isoweekday <5: 5 - current_isoweekday\n\nelif current_isoweekday ==5:7\n\nelse: 5 +7 - current_isoweekday\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday) %7, but if the result is 0, add 7.\n\nWait:\n\n(5 - current_isoweekday) %7:\n\nIf current is 5 (Friday): (5-5)=0 mod7=0. So if 0, then add 7.\n\nIf current is 6: (5-6)= -1 mod7=6. So days_to_add=6.\n\nIf current is 1: (5-1)=4 mod7=4.\n\nYes, so the formula would be days_to_add = ((5 - current_isoweekday) %7). If days_to_add ==0, set to 7.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nOnce I have days_to_add, then shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days and 17 hours (to get to 5 PM).\n\nWait, but need to shift by days_to_add days, then add 17 hours. But shifting by days and hours can be done in one step.\n\nSo the shift_timestamp function can take the current timestamp, and parameters weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds.\n\nSo the call would be shift_timestamp(timestamp=current_ts, days=days_to_add, hours=17).\n\nWait, but what about minutes and seconds? The user didn't specify, so maybe set to 0. But the function's parameters don't require them, but they can be included. Wait, the shift_timestamp function's required parameter is timestamp. The other parameters (weeks, days, etc.) are optional. So if we want to add days and hours, we can pass days and hours.\n\nBut in this case, we need to set the time to 5 PM. However, the current timestamp includes the current time. So shifting by days_to_add days would add days_to_add*24*3600 seconds, but the time of day would remain the same. Then adding 17 hours would shift the time to 17:00 (5 PM), but if the current time is, say, 10 PM, adding 17 hours would take it to 3 PM next day. Wait, but that's not what we want. We want to set the time to exactly 5 PM on Friday, regardless of current time.\n\nHmm, so maybe a better approach is to first get the midnight of next Friday, then add 17 hours.\n\nWait, here's the problem: the current timestamp includes the current date and time. To get next Friday at 5 PM, regardless of the current time, we need to:\n\n1. Find the next Friday's date (midnight).\n\n2. Add 17 hours to that to get 5 PM.\n\nBut how to compute the midnight of next Friday.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce we have the current timestamp, convert it to date-time info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n\nThen compute days_to_add as discussed.\n\nAdd days_to_add to the current date to get the date of",
