Since they don't have those, I can't use the tool directly. Maybe I should explain how they can find their coordinates? Like using a maps app or a website that provides location data. Or perhaps suggest enabling location services on their device. But I should stay within the scope of the tools provided. Wait, the tools only include search_lat_lon. Without the coordinates, I can't proceed with the function call. So I need to inform them that I can't determine their location without the coordinates and maybe guide them on how to obtain them. Let me check if there's any other way, but according to the tools given, there's no other function. So the answer should be that I need the coordinates to proceed. Let me phrase it clearly and offer assistance on how they might find those coordinates.\n</think>\n\nI currently don't have access to your device's location data. To find your location using the tools available, I'd need specific latitude and longitude coordinates. You can usually find your coordinates using a maps app (like Google Maps) by long-pressing your current location and copying the coordinates from the address. Would you like help with that process?",

They mentioned they can check a maps app. I should guide them on how to get the latitude and longitude from the app.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the steps for popular maps apps, like Google Maps. Let me think: in Google Maps, you can long-press your location, then the coordinates appear in the address. Alternatively, maybe tapping the location button and then sharing the coordinates.\n\nWait, the user might not be using Google Maps. Maybe mention other apps like Apple Maps, but the process might differ. However, Google Maps is common, so focus on that. Let me outline the steps clearly: open the app, locate their position, long-press, then copy the coordinates from the address that pops up.\n\nAlso, need to reassure them that once they provide the coordinates, I can use the search_lat_lon function to find the address. Make sure the instructions are simple and easy to follow. Maybe add an example of what the coordinates look like, like 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W, but in decimal format. Wait, usually they're in decimal degrees, so maybe like 37.7749, -122.4194.\n\nI should also mention that if they have trouble, they can ask for more help. Keep the tone friendly and helpful. Let me put that all together in a concise way.\n</think>\n\nGreat! Here's how to find your coordinates using Google Maps (or most other maps apps):\n\n1. Open the maps app and let it locate you (you should see a blue dot).\n2. Long-press your current location until an address appears.\n3. The coordinates will be in the address format: `latitude, longitude` (e.g., `37.7749, -122.4194` for San Francisco).\n4. Share those coordinates here, and I'll look up your exact location!\n\nLet me know if you need help with this process.",

Since the user hasn't provided the coordinates yet, the assistant can't use the search_lat_lon function.
