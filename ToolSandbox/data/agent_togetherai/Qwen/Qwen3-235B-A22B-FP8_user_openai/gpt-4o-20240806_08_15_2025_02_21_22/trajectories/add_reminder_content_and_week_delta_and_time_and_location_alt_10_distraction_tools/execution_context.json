                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. The user mentioned \"tomorrow,\" so I should calculate the date for tomorrow. But to get the exact timestamp, I need to convert that date and time into a POSIX timestamp.\n\nI already called the get_current_timestamp function, which gave me the current timestamp: 1755246388.048669. Let me convert that to a datetime to see the current date and time. Let me check. Wait, POSIX timestamps are in seconds since the epoch. Let me use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp to get the current year, month, day, etc. That way, I can add one day to get tomorrow's date.\n\nSo, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. Then, increment the day by 1. But I need to handle month and year transitions if necessary. However, using the shift_timestamp function might be easier. Since the current timestamp is known, adding 1 day's worth of seconds (86400) would give me tomorrow's same time. But the user wants 5 PM, not the same time. Wait, no. The current time might not be 5 PM. So I need to calculate tomorrow's date, set the time to 5 PM, then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current datetime info, I can create a new datetime for tomorrow at 5 PM. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Get current datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp.\n2. Add one day to the current day. Check if the month needs to roll over, etc. But maybe there's a function to handle that. Wait, the shift_timestamp function can add days. Let me think: if I take the current timestamp, shift it by +1 day using shift_timestamp with days=1, that would give me tomorrow's timestamp at the same time. Then, I need to adjust the time to 5 PM. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, after getting tomorrow's date, I can construct the desired datetime. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, tomorrow is 2023-10-06. Set the hour to 17 (5 PM), minute 0, second 0. Then convert that date and time into a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Convert current timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n- Add one day to get tomorrow's date. Maybe use shift_timestamp with days=1, then convert that to datetime info to get the correct day, month, year.\n- Then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0 for 5 PM.\n- Convert that datetime info to a timestamp.\n\nWait, but how to handle adding the day. Let me outline:\n\n1. Current timestamp is 1755246388.048669. Let's convert that to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Let's call that function.\n\nSo call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. Suppose the response is something like year=2023, month=10, day=15, hour=10, minute=30, etc. Then adding one day would be day 16. Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nTherefore, after getting the current datetime info, increment the day by 1, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nSo first, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. Then, add 1 to the day. Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut what if adding a day rolls over to the next month? The datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that, right?\n\nOnce I have the correct timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM, I can then use add_reminder with content \"Buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", the calculated timestamp, and possibly the location's latitude and longitude. Wait, the user mentioned \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" So I should get the location's coordinates for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nBut how? The user didn't provide latitude and longitude. So I need to find the coordinates for that location. The function search_location_around_lat_lon can search for a location given a query. But since the user didn't specify a current location, maybe I need to use another function. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires a location query and optional latitude and longitude to search around. But if latitude and longitude are not provided, it defaults to the current location. However, since the user hasn't provided their current location, I might not be able to find the exact coordinates for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. But maybe the function can still find it based on the name. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the location is just stored as part of the reminder without coordinates, but the function requires latitude and longitude to be optional. Wait, the add_reminder function allows latitude and longitude to be optional. So maybe the user just wants to store the reminder with the content, and the timestamp, and maybe the location name, but not the coordinates. However, the add_reminder function's parameters require content, reminder_timestamp, and optionally latitude and longitude. So to include the location's coordinates, I need to find them first.\n\nBut how? The user mentioned \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" So I need to search for that location using the search_location_around_lat_lon function. But since the user hasn't provided their current location, the function might default to a generic search. Alternatively, maybe the function can search based on the query without coordinates. Let me check the function description: \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nSo if latitude and longitude are not provided, it searches around the current location. But since the user hasn't provided their current location, and the assistant might not have access to that, perhaps the search will still work based on the query. For example, if the location is \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, Santa Clara, CA\" or something. But the user's query just says \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" So maybe the function can find it by name, but without coordinates, the search might not be accurate. However, the assistant is supposed to use the available functions. So to get the coordinates, I need to call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". Since latitude and longitude are optional, maybe the function can still find it without them. Alternatively, if the assistant is supposed to use the current location, but since the current location isn't provided, perhaps the function can still proceed.\n\nWait, but the search_location_around_lat_lon function's required parameter is \"location\". Latitude and longitude are optional. So I can call it with just the location. Let me check the function's required parameters: \"required\": [\"location\"]. So yes, I can call it with just the location. So first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get its coordinates.\n\nBut wait, the function's description says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. [...] When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" But the assistant doesn't have access to the current location unless the user provides it. However, the function might still attempt to find the location based on the query without coordinates. For example, if the location is specific enough, like \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, Santa Clara, CA\", but the user's input is \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". Maybe the function can still find it, but there might be multiple results. However, the assistant should proceed by calling the function with the given location.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Convert the current timestamp to datetime info to get today's date.\n2. Calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM as a timestamp.\n3. Search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get its latitude and longitude.\n4. Add the reminder with the content, the calculated timestamp, and the location's coordinates.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided their current location, step 3 might not return the correct coordinates. However, the assistant should proceed with the available functions. So first, let's handle the timestamp.\n\nSo after getting the current timestamp (1755246388.048669), call timestamp_to_datetime_info on that.\n\nThen, create a new datetime with day = day + 1, hour = 17, minute = 0, second = 0.\n\nThen convert that datetime back to a timestamp.\n\nOnce that's done, then proceed to search for the location's coordinates.\n\nBut the user's original query is to add a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. The content of the reminder would be \"Buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nSo, the steps in function calls would be:\n\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current timestamp to get current date.\n- Then, create a new datetime with day +1, time 17:00:00.\n- Convert that new datetime to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n-",
