But wait, the user didn't provide their current location. I can't assume where they are. The Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates are known, right? Let me check. The bridge is located at approximately 37.8199° N latitude and 122.4783° W longitude.\n\nBut the problem is the user's current location. Without that, I can't compute the distance. The tools available include calculate_lat_lon_distance, which requires both points. Should I ask the user to provide their current coordinates? Or maybe use another service to get their location? Wait, there's no function to get the user's current location. The available functions are search_lat_lon, search_stock, calculate_lat_lon_distance, and search_holiday. \n\nWait, search_lat_lon takes coordinates and returns an address. But the user needs to provide the coordinates. Since the user didn't give their current location, I can't proceed. Maybe I should prompt them to provide their current latitude and longitude so I can calculate the distance. Alternatively, maybe they can provide a city name, and I can look up its coordinates. But the tools don't have a function to search coordinates by city name. Oh, the search_lat_lon function takes coordinates to get an address. So if the user can provide their current coordinates, I can use calculate_lat_lon_distance with those and the bridge's coordinates. Otherwise, I can't. \n\nSo the answer should be to inform the user that I need their current latitude and longitude to calculate the distance. Let me check the Golden Gate Bridge coordinates again. Yes, 37.8199, -122.4783. So once the user provides their current coordinates, I can call calculate_lat_lon_distance with both points. Until then, I can't proceed. Therefore, the response should ask for the user's current coordinates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, I need your current **latitude** and **longitude** coordinates. For example:\n- Latitude: 37.7749 (San Francisco)\n- Longitude: -122.4194\n\nOnce you provide your current coordinates, I’ll calculate the distance using the bridge’s coordinates (37.8199, -122.4783).",

Let me think.\n\nFirst, the functions available include calculate_lat_lon_distance, which needs two pairs of coordinates. But without their current location, I can't proceed. Maybe there's another way? Let me check the other functions. The other tools are search_stock, search_lat_lon, and search_holiday. None of these seem relevant here. \n\nWait, maybe if they can provide another location name, I could look up its coordinates. But the user hasn't mentioned any other location. The problem is the user doesn't know their current coordinates. So I can't use the calculate_lat_lon_distance function without that info. \n\nThe response should inform them that without their current coordinates, the distance can't be calculated. Alternatively, maybe suggest they enable location services if they're using a device that can provide that. But since I can't access their device, I just need to state the requirement clearly. \n\nI should also check if there's a way to get their location through another function. The search_lat_lon function takes coordinates to find an address, but they don't have those. So no, that's not helpful. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be that I need their current latitude and longitude to proceed. If they don't know, I can't calculate the distance. Maybe give an example of how they can find their coordinates, like using a maps app or a website. But since I can't do that for them, I just need to reiterate the necessity of that data.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, I require your current **latitude** and **longitude** coordinates. Without this information, the calculation cannot proceed. \n\nFor example:\n- If you are in San Francisco, you could use:  \n  Latitude: 37.7749, Longitude: -122.4194  \n- If you are in Los Angeles, you could use:  \n  Latitude: 34.0522, Longitude: -118.2437  \n\nIf you’re unsure how to find your current coordinates, you can share your city name or use a mapping service to locate them.

Open the **Google Maps** app.\n2. Tap and hold your current location (the blue dot).\n3. A pop-up will show coordinates like `37.7749° N, 122.4194° W` (San Francisco).  \n4. Share those coordinates here!\n\n### 💻 On a Computer:\n1. Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and find your location.\n2. Right-click your exact spot.\n3. Copy the coordinates from the address bar (e.g., `37.7749,-122.4194`).\n\nOnce you share your coordinates, I’ll calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge (`37.8199° N, 122.4783° W`) using math! 🌉📐",
