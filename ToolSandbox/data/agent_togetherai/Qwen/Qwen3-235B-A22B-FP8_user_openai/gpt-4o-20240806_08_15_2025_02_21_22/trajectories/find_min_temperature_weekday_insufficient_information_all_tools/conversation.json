    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the lowest temperature this Friday. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a function available that can provide weather information. Looking at the list of tools provided, I see functions for adding contacts, sending messages, converting currency, checking service statuses, and more. But I don't see any functions related to weather data. The closest might be something like searching for holidays or converting dates, but that's not directly relevant.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use a different approach if there's no direct function. For example, maybe I can't access real-time weather data, so I should inform the user that I can't provide that information. Alternatively, if there's a function that can get the current temperature, but even then, the user is asking for the lowest temperature on a specific day, which would require historical data or a forecast.\n\nLooking again at the tools, there's a function called 'search_holiday' but that's for US holidays. Also, there's 'timestamp_to_datetime_info' which could help with date calculations, but without a weather API function, I can't retrieve temperature data.\n\nSince there's no available function to get weather information, the correct response would be to tell the user that I can't access real-time weather data and suggest they check a weather service or app for the latest updates on Friday's temperatures. I should also mention that if they need help with something else, I'm here for that.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time weather data or forecasting capabilities. You'll need to check a weather service or app for the latest forecast on Friday's temperatures in your area. \n\nLet me know if you'd like help with something else!"
