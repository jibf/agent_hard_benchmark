The user didn't specify a date or time, so I should ask for clarification. Wait, the system message says not to assume values. So I can't just set a default time. I need to prompt the user to provide the date and time for the reminder. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a function to convert the current time to a timestamp, but the user hasn't mentioned any specific time. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires year, month, day, etc., which I don't have. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided a specific time, the correct approach is to ask them to specify the date and time for the reminder. That way, I can collect the necessary parameters and then call add_reminder with the correct timestamp.\n</think>\n\nTo set a reminder to buy chocolate milk, please specify the date and time when you'd like to receive the reminder. For example:  \n- \"Remind me tomorrow at 3 PM\"  \n- \"Remind me on October 25th at 10 AM\"  \n\nLet me know the details, and I'll create the reminder for you!",

I used the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the provided details: day 22, month 3, year 2024, hour 17 (since it's 5 PM), and minutes and seconds as 0. That gave me the timestamp 1711155600.\n\nNext, I called the add_reminder function with the content \"buy chocolate milk\" and the calculated timestamp. The response from the tool was a UUID, which means the reminder was successfully created. Now, I should confirm to the user that the reminder is set and maybe mention the timestamp used. I should keep it simple and friendly, ensuring they know it's done and offering further help if needed.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to \"buy chocolate milk\" has been set for **March 22, 2024, at 5:00 PM** (POSIX timestamp: 1711155600). Let me know if you'd like to adjust or add anything else! 😊",
