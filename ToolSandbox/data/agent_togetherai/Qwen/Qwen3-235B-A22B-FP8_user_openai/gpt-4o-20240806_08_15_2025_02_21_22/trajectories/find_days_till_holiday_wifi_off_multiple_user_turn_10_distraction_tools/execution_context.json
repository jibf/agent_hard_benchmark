But there was a ConnectionError saying Wifi is not enabled. Hmm, maybe the search_holiday function requires internet access to look up the holiday information. Since the user's device doesn't have Wifi on, it can't connect to the internet to retrieve that data.\n\nSo, I need to inform the user that I can't perform the search without Wifi. But I should also check if there's another way to get the information. Wait, Christmas Day is on December 25th every year. Maybe I can provide that answer without needing the function. But according to the tools provided, the search_holiday function is supposed to canonicalize the holiday name into a timestamp. However, since the function is failing due to lack of internet, I can't use it here.\n\nI should let the user know that Wifi is needed for that function, but also offer the known date for Christmas as a fallback. That way, even without internet, they get the answer they need. Alternatively, if the system has offline holiday data, maybe the function could work without Wifi, but the error suggests it's relying on an online service. So the best approach is to explain the Wifi requirement and provide the known date.\n</think>\n\nI can't look up holiday dates without an internet connection. However, I can tell you that Christmas Day is always on December 25th. Would you like me to help with anything else?",

They probably want more info, like the date for a specific year or maybe the day of the week. Since the previous attempt to search the holiday failed due to Wi-Fi being off, I should check if they want to try again with Wi-Fi on. Alternatively, if they just need the date confirmed for a particular year, I can calculate that if given the year. Let me ask them to clarify what they need next.\n</think>\n\nSince you already know the date is December 25th, would you like me to:\n1. Check what day of the week Christmas falls on this year?\n2. Calculate the date for a specific year (e.g., Christmas 2025)?\n3. Help with something else related?\n\nLet me know how I can assist further!",
