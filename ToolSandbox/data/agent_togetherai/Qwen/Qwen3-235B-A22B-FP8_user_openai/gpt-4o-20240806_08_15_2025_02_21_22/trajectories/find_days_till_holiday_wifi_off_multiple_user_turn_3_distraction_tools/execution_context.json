So I checked the wifi status with get_wifi_status and it returned False.\n\nNow I need to figure out how to handle this. The user probably wants to know when Christmas Day is, but the system can't access the internet because Wifi is off. Since the search_holiday function requires an internet connection to look up the holiday dates, without Wifi, it can't retrieve that information. \n\nI should let the user know that Wifi is disabled and that's why the connection error occurred. Then, maybe suggest enabling Wifi to get the answer. But I should also check if there's another way to provide the information without needing the internet. However, looking at the available tools, the only way to get holiday dates is through the search_holiday function, which likely needs an online database. \n\nSo the next step is to inform the user about the Wifi issue and ask if they want to enable it. If they agree, I can call the set_wifi_status function to turn it on. Once Wifi is enabled, I can retry the search_holiday function to find Christmas Day's date. \n\nAlternatively, if the user doesn't want to enable Wifi, I might not be able to provide the exact date. But maybe I can mention that Christmas is on December 25th every year, which is common knowledge. However, the system might not have that built-in, so relying on the function is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the best approach is to explain the issue and prompt the user to enable Wifi for accurate information. If they accept, proceed to turn on Wifi and then fetch the holiday date again.\n</think>\n\nThe connection error occurred because Wi-Fi is currently disabled. Would you like me to enable Wi-Fi to retrieve the Christmas Day information? \n\nIf you prefer not to enable Wi-Fi, I can still share that **Christmas Day** is widely observed on **December 25th** every year in the United States and many other countries.

But to calculate the exact days remaining, I need the current date.\n\nWait, in the previous interaction, the user tried to use the search_holiday function, but there was a connection error because Wi-Fi was off. The user then asked again, and the system checked the Wi-Fi status, which was still off. Now, the user is asking again, but the Wi-Fi is still disabled. \n\nSince the user can't connect to Wi-Fi, I can't fetch the current date or the holiday information online. The system's last response mentioned that Christmas is on December 25th, so maybe the user wants an estimate based on that. However, without knowing the current date, I can't compute the exact days left. \n\nThe user might not have realized that the system can't access real-time data without Wi-Fi. I should explain that and offer an alternative. For example, if today's date is known, I can calculate manually. But since I can't get the current timestamp, I need to ask the user to provide the current date or enable Wi-Fi. Alternatively, I can give a general answer if the user is okay with an approximate value. \n\nWait, the tools available include get_current_timestamp, which requires Wi-Fi? Or is that function independent? Let me check the tools again. The get_current_timestamp function doesn't have parameters, but if the system can't access the internet without Wi-Fi, maybe that function also relies on network connectivity. If the user's device needs Wi-Fi to get the current timestamp, then without it, even that function won't work. \n\nSo, the user is asking for days until Christmas, but without Wi-Fi, I can't get the current date or the holiday date. The previous search_holiday failed, so even if the system has some cached data, it might not be reliable. \n\nTherefore, the best approach is to inform the user that without Wi-Fi, I can't fetch real-time data. Offer to provide the fixed date of Christmas (Dec 25) and ask if they want to proceed with enabling Wi-Fi or provide the current date manually. Alternatively, if they know today's date, they can input it, and I can calculate the difference. \n\nBut since the user might not know the current date, maybe the system can use the last known timestamp? However, if the device doesn't have internet access, the timestamp might not be accurate. \n\nIn the end, the response should clarify the need for Wi-Fi to get accurate information and offer alternatives if the user can't enable it.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the exact days until Christmas Day (December 25th), I need to know the current date.

If not, then I can't retrieve the current date or the holiday details. \n\nAlternatively, if the user knows the current date, they could provide it, and I can calculate manually. But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to prompt them again for whether they want to enable Wi-Fi or proceed with the fixed date.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the user was asked if they wanted to enable Wi-Fi, but they didn't respond. Now, they're asking again. Maybe they didn't realize that Wi-Fi needs to be on. So I should reiterate the options: enable Wi-Fi, provide the current date, or give the fixed date with a general estimate.\n\nI need to make sure the user understands the limitations here.

Let me structure the response clearly, listing the options again so the user can choose the best path. Need to be helpful but also clear about the limitations.\n</think>\n\nTo provide the exact number of days until Christmas Day (December 25th), **I require internet access** to fetch the current date and verify the holiday. Since Wi-Fi is currently disabled, here are your options:\n\n1. **Enable Wi-Fi**: I can calculate the precise days once connected.\n2. **Share today’s date manually**: If you provide the current date (e.g., \"July 25, 2024\"), I can compute the difference.\n3. **Fixed date reminder**: Christmas Day is always on **December 25th**. As of today (assuming today is July 25, 2024), there are **153 days** left. \n\nWould you like to proceed with one of these options? 🎁",
