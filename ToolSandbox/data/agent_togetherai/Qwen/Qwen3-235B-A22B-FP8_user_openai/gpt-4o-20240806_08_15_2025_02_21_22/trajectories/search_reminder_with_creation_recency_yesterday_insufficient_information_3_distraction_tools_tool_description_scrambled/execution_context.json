                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the time frame for \"yesterday.\" To do that, I should calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. But wait, how do I get the current time? Since the system might handle that, I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current timestamp and then subtract a day. Alternatively, maybe the shift_timestamp function can help here. \n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any specific details about their timezone or the exact time they consider yesterday. Hmm, I'll have to make an assumption that \"yesterday\" refers to the previous day relative to the current time in the system's timezone. But I should note that if there's any ambiguity, the user might need to clarify. \n\nLet me outline the steps. First, get the current timestamp. Then subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday. Then subtract another 24 hours to get the end of yesterday. Wait, no. Let's think: today is October 10th, so yesterday is October 9th. The start of yesterday would be 00:00 on October 9th, and the end would be 23:59:59. So I need to find reminders created between those two timestamps.\n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? The system might have a function for that. However, looking at the tools provided, there's no direct way to get the current timestamp. Oh, wait, the user might need to provide that information, but they didn't. Wait, but maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info function can be used with the current timestamp. But since I can't access the current time directly, perhaps the user expects a relative calculation based on the current time. But since the assistant can't know the current time without a function, maybe the user expects me to use the functions provided to calculate the bounds.\n\nWait, the functions include shift_timestamp. Let me think: if I had the current timestamp, I could subtract a day. But how to get the current timestamp? There's no function that provides that. Hmm. Wait, maybe the user expects me to use the current time as a reference point, but since I can't get that from the functions, perhaps the system will handle that. Alternatively, maybe the user's question implies that the assistant should use the current time as a reference.\n\nWait, but the functions available don't include getting the current time. The closest is timestamp_to_datetime_info, which requires a timestamp. So perhaps the assistant needs to ask the user for the current time? But that's not practical. Alternatively, maybe the system will handle the current timestamp automatically when using the shift_timestamp function. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the functions.\n\nWait, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function allows converting a specific date and time into a timestamp. So maybe the assistant can calculate yesterday's start and end times by first getting the current date, then subtracting a day. But without knowing the current date, that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the assistant needs to call a function that can convert the current datetime into a timestamp. But since there's no function to get the current time, maybe the assistant can't proceed. Wait, but perhaps the user expects that the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a base timestamp. However, the shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp as input. Without that input, it can't proceed. \n\nThis is a problem. The assistant can't determine the current timestamp on its own. Therefore, the assistant needs to clarify with the user. Wait, but maybe the user's system will provide the current timestamp automatically. However, according to the given functions, there's no function to get the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant can't compute \"yesterday\" without additional information. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp, but since that's not provided, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user to provide the current date and time, or clarify the timeframe. But the user's question is \"What's the reminder I created yesterday?\" and they might expect that the system can handle it without explicit input. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The assistant might need to inform the user that it can't determine the current time and thus can't find reminders from yesterday. But looking back at the tools, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current time. Wait, no, because that function requires a timestamp as input. Without knowing the current timestamp, the assistant can't convert it into a datetime. \n\nTherefore, the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp. But since the user hasn't provided that, the assistant must ask for clarification. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the assistant to use the current time, but since the functions don't allow that, the assistant might need to make an assumption. However, the instructions say not to make assumptions about function parameters. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the current time is needed to determine \"yesterday.\" But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can proceed by using the shift_timestamp function with a reference timestamp. For example, if the user's system can provide the current timestamp as part of the query, but in this scenario, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, the assistant should respond that it needs more information to determine the current time in order to find reminders from yesterday. \n\nBut the user's question doesn't provide the current date. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user to provide the current date and time, or clarify the exact dates for yesterday. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the current date as of when the query is made, but since the functions don't support that, it's impossible. \n\nSo the conclusion is that without knowing the current timestamp, the assistant can't calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user to provide the current date and time, or confirm the specific date they consider as \"yesterday.\" However, the user might expect that the assistant can use the system's current time. But since the provided functions don't have a way to get the current time, the assistant can't. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is to inform the user that to find reminders from yesterday, the assistant needs to know the current date and time, or the specific date for yesterday. Alternatively, the user can provide the exact date for yesterday, such as \"October 9th, 2023,\" and then the assistant can convert that into timestamps. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided that information, the assistant should ask for clarification. Therefore, the assistant should not proceed to call the search_reminder function with estimated timestamps because the functions don't allow that without knowing the current time. \n\nHence, the correct approach is to ask the user to provide the current date and time, or specify the exact date they mean by \"yesterday\" to proceed with the search.\n</think>\n\nTo find reminders created yesterday, I need to determine the current date and time to calculate the correct timestamp range. However, I don't have access to the current timestamp. Could you please provide the current date and time, or confirm the specific date you consider as \"yesterday\"?",

The user hasn't provided any date information, so I can't proceed. \n\nMaybe the user is in a situation where they can't check the date themselves.
