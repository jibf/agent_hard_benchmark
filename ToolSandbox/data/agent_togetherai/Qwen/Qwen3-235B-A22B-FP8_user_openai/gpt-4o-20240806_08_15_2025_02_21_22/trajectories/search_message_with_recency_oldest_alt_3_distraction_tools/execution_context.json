But the system threw an error saying at least one search criteria is needed. That makes sense because searching without any parameters could be too broad.\n\nSo, I need to determine the correct criteria to find the first message. The first message would likely be the one with the earliest creation timestamp. However, the search_messages function doesn't allow specifying a sort order or limit. The parameters available are exact matches, fuzzy matches, or timestamp ranges.\n\nSince I can't directly get the earliest message, maybe I can find the minimum timestamp by using a lower bound. But how do I get the earliest timestamp? The functions available include get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, timestamp_diff, and unit_conversion. None of these directly help in finding the earliest timestamp in the database.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's first message is the oldest one. To find the oldest, I need to know the earliest timestamp. Without a way to query the minimum timestamp, maybe I can use a very old timestamp as the lower bound. For example, using a timestamp from many years ago as the lower bound and see if any messages exist. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a specific time frame in mind. If I don't have prior information, I might need to ask the user for a time frame. However, the user might not know the exact time. \n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function can adjust a given timestamp. If I could get the current timestamp and shift it back by a large amount, say several years, then use that as the lower bound. But the search_messages function requires exact criteria. Let me think: if I set a very low lowerbound, maybe I can capture the earliest message. \n\nFor example, using creation_timestamp_lowerbound as 0 (which is January 1, 1970). But maybe the system doesn't have messages that old. Alternatively, set a lowerbound way in the past and see if any messages come up. However, without knowing the actual earliest timestamp, this might not work. The search would return all messages after that lowerbound, but if there's no way to sort and get the first one, this approach might not suffice.\n\nWait, the search_messages function returns all messages that match the criteria. If I set a very broad lowerbound, maybe I can get a list, but without sorting, the first one isn't guaranteed. The user might need the earliest, so perhaps the system's earliest message is known through another method. But given the tools, I can't query for the min timestamp. \n\nThe problem is that the user needs to specify at least one search criterion. Since they didn't provide any, the assistant should ask for clarification. Maybe the user needs to specify a time frame, a contact, or some keyword. But the user is asking for the first ever text, so they might not know any details. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should inform the user that more information is needed. The initial attempt failed because no criteria were provided. The correct approach is to explain that at least one criterion is necessary and ask the user to provide details like a contact's phone number, a keyword in the message, or a time frame. Without that, the search can't be performed.\n</think>\n\nTo find your first ever text, I need more specific criteria since searching without filters isn't possible. Could you provide details like a contact's phone number, a keyword from the message, or a rough time frame? For example:  \n- \"Search for messages from John Smith\"  \n- \"Find messages older than 5 years\"  \n- \"Look for the word 'hello' in old texts\"  \n\nThis will help narrow down the search!",

They mentioned they don't have more information like a contact's number, keywords, or a time frame. \n\nHmm, the search_messages function requires at least one criteria. Without any, it's impossible to proceed. The user might not know that their messaging app might have a way to sort messages by date, maybe starting from the oldest.\n\nWait, maybe I can suggest checking the oldest messages by using the current timestamp and shifting it back as a lower bound. But the user doesn't know the exact time, so even that might not work. Alternatively, maybe they can use a very old timestamp as the lower bound to get the earliest messages.\n\nBut the problem is the function needs at least one parameter. Since the user doesn't have any info, perhaps I should explain that they need to use a different method, like checking their phone's settings or using a time range. Maybe they can use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time, then shift it back by a few years to set a lower bound for the search. But without knowing the exact time, this might not be reliable.\n\nWait, the user might not have access to those functions. So I need to guide them to use the available tools. But since they don't have any info, the best advice is to suggest using a very broad time range, like starting from a timestamp that's way in the past. However, the search_messages function might not allow that. Alternatively, they might need to use the shift_timestamp function to create a lower bound by subtracting a large number of days or years from the current timestamp.\n\nBut the user might not know how to do that. So the response should explain that they need to set a time range, even if approximate, to find the oldest messages. Maybe they can use the get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then shift it back by several years to set a lower bound. For example, get the current timestamp, subtract 5 years (which is 5*365 days), and use that as the lowerbound. Then use search_messages with creation_timestamp_lowerbound set to that value. But since the user doesn't have any info, they might not know how to do this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can help them by generating a very old timestamp. But the user might not know to ask for that. Since the user can't provide any criteria, the assistant can't proceed with the search. Therefore, the best approach is to inform the user that they need at least some criteria, even if it's a time range, and offer to help them generate that if they can provide a rough idea of when the first message was sent.\n</think>\n\nWithout any criteria, I can't search for messages. However, if you're looking for the oldest message in your history, we could try setting a very broad time range as a workaround. For example, I could use your current timestamp and shift it back by a large number of days to create a lower bound. Would you like me to attempt this approach?",
