I should inform them that I need the specific ID to delete the contact. Alternatively, if there's a way to search for the contact by phone number first, but the tools don't include a search function. \n\nTherefore, I must ask the user to clarify and provide the person_id associated with that phone number.

Without it, the system can't identify which contact to delete. Since the user doesn't have the person_id, I can't proceed with the removal. \n\nThe user might not know where to find the person_id or might think the phone number is enough. I should explain that the system needs the unique ID to avoid deleting the wrong contact. Maybe suggest checking the contacts list again to find the ID. \n\nAlso, the user might be frustrated, so I should stay helpful and offer assistance with other contact operations if needed. Let me make sure my response is clear and guides them towards the next steps without leaving them hanging.\n</think>\n\nI'm unable to remove the contact without the person_id, as it's required to uniquely identify which contact to delete. If you don't have the person_id handy, you'll need to:\n\n1. Check your contacts list to locate the specific entry for +12453344098\n2. Note down its associated person_id\n3. Then I can help remove it using that ID\n\nWould you like me to help with anything else regarding your contacts?",
