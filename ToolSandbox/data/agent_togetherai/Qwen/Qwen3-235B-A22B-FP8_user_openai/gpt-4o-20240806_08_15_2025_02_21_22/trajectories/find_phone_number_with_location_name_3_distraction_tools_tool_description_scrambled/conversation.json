The available functions are search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, and search_weather_around_lat_lon. None of these functions directly mention retrieving phone numbers. \n\nThe search_location_around_lat_lon function might be related if it can fetch location details, but the description doesn't specify phone numbers. The other functions are for weather, stock, and coordinates, which aren't relevant here. \n\nSince there's no function designed to retrieve phone numbers or detailed contact information, I can't use any of the provided tools. I should inform the user that I can't assist with that request using the available functions.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to phone number lookup capabilities through the provided functions. The available tools only support location/coordinate searches, weather, and stock information. Would you like me to help with something else?"

The tools include search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, and search_weather_around_lat_lon. None of these seem relevant to phone numbers. So, best to apologize and ask if they need help with something else. Yeah, that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\nSince I can't assist with phone number lookups and you've indicated you don't have additional details to share, is there another way I can help with location-based searches, weather, or stock information?
