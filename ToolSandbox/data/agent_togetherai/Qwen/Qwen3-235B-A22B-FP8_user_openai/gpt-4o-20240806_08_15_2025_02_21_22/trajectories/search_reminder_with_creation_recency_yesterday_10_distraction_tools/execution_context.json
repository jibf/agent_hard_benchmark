                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's the reminder I created yesterday?\" Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what functions are available. The search_reminder function allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. Since the user wants reminders created yesterday, I need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday and set the appropriate bounds.\n\nWait, how do I get the current timestamp? There's a get_current_timestamp function. Let me use that to find the current time, then subtract a day to find yesterday's start and end times. But wait, the user might mean any time during yesterday. So the lowerbound would be the start of yesterday, and upperbound the end of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, using the shift_timestamp function to subtract 24 hours from the current timestamp to get the lowerbound. But maybe it's better to calculate the exact start and end of yesterday. Hmm, but maybe the user just wants reminders created within the last 24 hours, which would be from current time minus 24 hours. Wait, but the question is \"yesterday,\" which typically refers to the day before today, regardless of the current time. So for example, if today is Monday, yesterday is Sunday. So to get all reminders created on Sunday, we need the start of Sunday and end of Sunday.\n\nBut to do that, I need to first get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to find the current date, subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then convert that to a timestamp. However, there's a function called timestamp_to_datetime_info which can get the date components. Alternatively, using shift_timestamp to subtract a day.\n\nWait, the user might not need exact day boundaries. Maybe using the last 24 hours is sufficient. Let me check the functions available. There's a get_current_timestamp function. Let me call that first. Then, subtract 24 hours (which is 86400 seconds) from the current timestamp to get the lowerbound. The upperbound would be the current timestamp minus one second (but maybe not necessary). Wait, the user is asking for reminders created yesterday, so perhaps the creation_timestamp should be between yesterday's start and end. But without knowing the exact date, maybe using the last 24 hours is a practical approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the user says \"yesterday,\" that's a 24-hour period starting from midnight of the previous day. But without knowing the exact date, maybe the best approach is to use the current timestamp minus 24 hours as the lowerbound and current timestamp as the upperbound. But wait, no. Because \"yesterday\" refers to the day before today, not the last 24 hours. For example, if it's 3 PM today, \"yesterday\" would be from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM of the previous day. However, without knowing the exact dates, this might be complicated. \n\nGiven the available functions, perhaps the best way is to get the current timestamp, shift it back by 24 hours (using shift_timestamp with days=-1), then set that as the lowerbound and the current timestamp as the upperbound. Wait, no. Let me think again. To get yesterday's start and end:\n\nBut how to calculate that? Maybe the user's query is better handled by searching reminders created in the last 24 hours. That's a common approach. So, the lowerbound would be current_timestamp - 86400 seconds (24 hours), and upperbound is current_timestamp. However, this might include reminders created today if the current time is early, but maybe it's the closest approximation with the given functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants reminders created exactly yesterday. So, first, get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, subtract one day, then create a timestamp for midnight of that day, and the upperbound would be midnight of the current day. But the available functions don't have a way to convert a date back to a timestamp unless we use datetime_info_to_timestamp. So steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert it to datetime_info to get year, month, day.\n3. Subtract one day from that date.\n4. Convert that date back to a timestamp for midnight of yesterday.\n5. Then, create a search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound = yesterday's midnight, and upperbound = today's midnight.\n\nBut the problem is that the assistant can only call functions step by step. Since the user's query is straightforward, maybe the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut in the tools provided, the search_reminder function can take creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So, the assistant needs to compute the start of yesterday and the start of today as the upper and lower bounds.\n\nBut to do that, the assistant needs to:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_time.\n2. Convert current_time to datetime_info to get current date.\n3. Subtract one day to get yesterday's date.\n4. Convert yesterday's date at 00:00:00 to a timestamp for lowerbound.\n5. Convert today's date at 00:00:00 to a timestamp for upperbound.\n\nHowever, the assistant can't do all these steps in one go. Each function call is needed. But since the assistant can't chain function calls in a single response, perhaps the best approach is to use the shift_timestamp function to subtract 24 hours from the current timestamp to get a lowerbound, and set upperbound as current timestamp. But this would include the last 24 hours, which might not exactly be \"yesterday\" if the current time is not at midnight. However, given the available functions, this might be the closest approximation.\n\nWait, but maybe the user's \"yesterday\" is relative to the current day, not the exact 24 hours. For example, if it's 10 AM today, \"yesterday\" would be any time from midnight to 11:59 PM of the previous day. To capture that, the assistant needs to find the start of the previous day. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n2. Convert current_ts to datetime_info (current_dt) to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Subtract one day from current_dt to get yesterday_dt.\n4. Convert yesterday_dt at 0:00:00 to a timestamp (lowerbound).\n5. Convert current_dt at 0:00:00 to a timestamp (upperbound).\n6. Search reminders with creation_timestamp between lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut the assistant can't do all these steps in one go. Each function call needs to be made sequentially. Since the user's query requires this, the assistant would need to first get the current timestamp, then shift it to yesterday's start, but perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to subtract a day, but that might not set the time to midnight.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function allows shifting the timestamp by weeks, days, hours, etc. For example, if current_ts is at 2023-10-05 15:00:00, shifting by days=-1 would give 2023-10-04 15:00:00. But we want the start of the previous day, so we need to subtract the number of hours, minutes, seconds to reach midnight. However, without knowing the exact current time, this isn't straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can approximate by using current_ts - 86400 seconds (24 hours) for the lowerbound and current_ts for upperbound. This would capture reminders created in the last 24 hours, which might include some from today if the current time is early, but maybe the user considers that as \"yesterday\". Alternatively, if the user says \"yesterday\", they might mean the entire previous day, which would require the start of the previous day. But without the ability to calculate that exactly, the assistant might proceed with the 24-hour window.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should call get_current_timestamp, then subtract 86400 seconds (24 hours) to get the lowerbound, and use the current timestamp as the upperbound. Then, call search_reminder with those bounds.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get current_ts.\n2. Then, calculate lowerbound = current_ts - 86400.\n3. Call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound=lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound=current_ts.\n\nBut since the assistant can't execute multiple steps, perhaps in the first step, the assistant needs to call get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then use that to compute the lowerbound. However, in the initial response, the assistant can only make one function call. Therefore, the assistant needs to first call get_current_timestamp to get the current timestamp, then in the next step, use that to compute the lower and upper bounds. But since the user's query is a single message, the assistant must make a single function call. Wait, but the assistant can chain function calls based on the available tools. Wait, no. The user's message is a single query, and the assistant must decide which function to call. However, the assistant can't call multiple functions in one response. Therefore, the assistant might need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound as current timestamp minus 24 hours and upperbound as current timestamp. But since the functions require explicit parameters, the assistant needs to compute those values. But how?\n\nWait",
