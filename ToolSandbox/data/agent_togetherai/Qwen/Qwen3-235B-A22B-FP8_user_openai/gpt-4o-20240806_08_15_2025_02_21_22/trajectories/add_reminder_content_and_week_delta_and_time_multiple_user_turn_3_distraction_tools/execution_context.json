It requires content and a reminder_timestamp. The content here would be \"buy chocolate milk\". But I need a timestamp. The user didn't specify a time, so maybe I should ask for clarification. Wait, but maybe the user expects a default time, like a common scenario. However, the tools don't allow assuming values. The get_current_timestamp function can get the current time, but when adding a reminder, the user probably wants a future time. Since the user didn't specify, I should ask them when they want the reminder. Alternatively, maybe I can use get_current_timestamp and shift it, but the user hasn't mentioned a specific delay. For example, if they want it now, but that's unlikely. The safest approach is to ask the user to confirm the time for the reminder because the function requires reminder_timestamp, which isn't provided. So I need to prompt them for that information before proceeding.\n</think>\n\nTo set a reminder to buy chocolate milk, I need to know when you'd like to be reminded.

                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to be reminded tomorrow at 5 PM to buy chocolate milk. Let me figure out how to set that up.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. The user said \"tomorrow,\" which is one day from now. So I'll use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. Once I have that, I can add a day to it.\n\nWait, but the add_reminder function needs a reminder_timestamp. To calculate tomorrow's date, I can take the current timestamp and add 1 day. But how do I handle the time part? The user wants 5 PM. So maybe I should first get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, and then set the time to 17:00 (5 PM). But how do I do that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. If I get the current date and time, add one day to the day, and then set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0. But to get the current date and time, I need to convert the current timestamp to datetime info. Wait, but first, I need to get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Then, add one day to the day, set the hour to 17, and then convert back to a timestamp with datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the functions available are: get_current_timestamp, datetime_info_to_timestamp, shift_timestamp. Let me think. Maybe using shift_timestamp would be easier. The user wants tomorrow at 5 PM. If the current time is, say, 10 AM today, then tomorrow at 5 PM is 29 hours from now. But shifting by days and hours. Wait, the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by weeks, days, hours, etc. So if I take the current timestamp, add 1 day and (17 - current hour) hours? No, because if the current time is, say, 10 AM, then adding 1 day (24 hours) would get me to 10 AM tomorrow, then adding 7 hours would get to 5 PM. But maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, to set the time to exactly 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of the current time. So perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert it to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add 1 day to the day, handling month and year changes if needed.\n4. Set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nBut that requires using timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the components, adjust them, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp. However, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the current timestamp, so I need to call get_current_timestamp first.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n- Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Let's say the current timestamp is T.\n- From the datetime info, extract year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n- Add 1 day to the day. But need to handle if the day exceeds the month's days, etc. But the timestamp_to_datetime_info should handle that when converted back. Wait, no, because when you add 1 day to the day, but if the month is, say, January 31st, adding a day would make it February 1st. But when converting back, the datetime_info_to_timestamp should handle that correctly.\n- Then, set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n- Now, use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shift the current timestamp by 1 day and then adjust the time. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the shift_timestamp function can be used. If the user wants tomorrow at 5 PM, that's equivalent to adding 1 day plus (17 - current hour) hours plus (0 - current minute) minutes plus (0 - current second) seconds. But that's complicated because it depends on the current time. However, maybe using the shift_timestamp function with days=1, and then set the time to 17:00. Wait, but shift_timestamp can only add or subtract time deltas. So if I add 1 day and then adjust hours, minutes, seconds. But how much to adjust?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, then convert it to datetime info to get the year, month, day, then set the time to 17:00:00, then convert back. Wait, but how to do that?\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get T0.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T0 to get current date and time components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n\n3. Add 1 day to the day. Let's say the current day is 5, then new day is 6. If it's 31 and the month has 30 days, then the function should handle it? Or maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp will handle it.\n\n4. Set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n\n5. Then call datetime_info_to_timestamp with these adjusted values to get the reminder_timestamp.\n\nBut wait, adding 1 day could be done with shift_timestamp. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp with days=1, then adjust the time. But how?\n\nAlternatively, if the current time is T0, then tomorrow at 17:00 is T0 + 1 day + (17:00 - current time's hour:minute:second). But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using the shift_timestamp function with days=1, hours= (17 - current hour), minutes= (0 - current minute), seconds= (0 - current second). But that requires knowing the current hour, minute, second, which we get from the first two steps.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp → T0.\n\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info → {year, month, day, hour, minute, second, ...}.\n\n3. Compute delta_days = 1, delta_hours = 17 - hour, delta_minutes = 0 - minute, delta_seconds = 0 - second.\n\n4. Then, call shift_timestamp with T0, days=delta_days, hours=delta_hours, minutes=delta_minutes, seconds=delta_seconds.\n\nBut wait, that would add 1 day, plus the delta hours, which could be negative. For example, if current time is 10:30:00, then delta_days=1, delta_hours=17-10=7, delta_minutes= -30, delta_seconds=0. So total shift is 1 day + 7 hours -30 minutes. Which would effectively set it to tomorrow 17:00 minus 30 minutes? Wait, no. Wait, the shift is cumulative. So T0 + 1 day + (7 hours -30 minutes). So if T0 is 10:30, adding 1 day (24h) → 10:30 next day, then 7h-0.5h=6.5h → 10:30 + 6h30m = 17:00 next day. So that works.\n\nBut how to calculate that using the functions. Because after getting T0, then converting to datetime info, we can compute the deltas.\n\nBut since the functions are separate, perhaps this approach is possible.\n\nSo in code terms:\n\n- User says \"tomorrow at 5 PM\".\n\n- Get current timestamp T0.\n\n- Convert T0 to datetime info: get hour, minute, second.\n\n- Calculate the shifted timestamp by adding 1 day, and adjusting hours, minutes, seconds to reach 17:00.\n\nBut how? The shift_timestamp function requires a base timestamp and deltas. So:\n\nshifted_timestamp = shift_timestamp(T0, days=1, hours=(17 - hour), minutes=(-minute), seconds=(-second)).\n\nWait, because:\n\nAdding 1 day (so +24 hours), then adding (17 - current hour) hours. Let's say current hour is 10. 17-10=7, so total hours added: 24+7=31 hours.\n\nThen, minutes: subtract current minute. If current minute is 30, then minutes=-30. So total time added: 31 hours -30 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, subtract current seconds.\n\nThis would set the time to 17:00:00 of the next day.\n\nYes. Because:\n\nSuppose current time is 10:30:45.\n\nAdding 1 day (24h), 17-10=7h → total 24+7=31h.\n\nThen subtract 30 minutes → 31h -30m.\n\nThen subtract 45 seconds → 31h-30m-45s.\n\nWhich would bring us to 17:00:00 the next day.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp → T0.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T0 to get hour, minute, second.\n\n3. Call shift_timestamp with T0, days=1, hours=(17 - hour), minutes=(-minute), seconds=(-second). The result is the timestamp for tomorrow",
