                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact date and time for next Friday. Since today's date isn't provided, I should use the current timestamp to calculate it. But wait, the functions available include get_current_timestamp. Let me call that first to get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can find out what day of the week it is. Using timestamp_to_datetime_info might help here. The isoweekday ranges from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday). Let's say today is, for example, Wednesday (3). Then next Friday would be in 2 days. Wait, but if today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days. Hmm, so I need to calculate the number of days to add to the current timestamp to reach the next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using shift_timestamp with days and weeks. Let's think. If today's isoweekday is known, then the number of days to add would be (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. Wait, if today is Friday (5), then (5-5 +7) mod7 is 0, so add 7 days. If today is Thursday (4), then 5-4=1, so add 1 day. That would give the next Friday.\n\nOnce I have the correct date, then set the time to 5 PM. So, convert the date to a datetime_info object, set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0, then convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user might not have specified the time zone. Assuming the user's local time zone? The functions probably handle that, but since the tools don't mention time zones, maybe we proceed with the system's assumption.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime_info to get current day of week.\n3. Calculate days to add to reach next Friday.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by those days to get the Friday date.\n5. Then adjust the time to 5 PM (17:00) using datetime_info_to_timestamp again.\n6. Finally, add the reminder with the content and the calculated timestamp.\n\nBut wait, the functions available don't have a direct way to set the time. Let me check the functions again. There's datetime_info_to_timestamp which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So after shifting to the correct date, I need to extract the year, month, day from that shifted timestamp, then set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0, then convert that into a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, after step 3, once the date is determined, create a datetime_info with that date and the desired time, then convert to timestamp.\n\nBut how do I get the date from the shifted timestamp? Let me think:\n\n- After getting current_timestamp, convert to datetime_info to get current date parts.\n- Calculate days_to_add to reach next Friday.\n- Shift current_timestamp by days_to_add to get a new timestamp.\n- Convert that new timestamp to datetime_info to get the year, month, day.\n- Then set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert this datetime_info back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems feasible.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any specific date functions, I need to use the available tools step by step. Let me outline each function call:\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp:\n\nget_current_timestamp()\n\nThen, convert that to datetime_info:\n\ntimestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=current_timestamp)\n\nFrom that, get the isoweekday. Then calculate days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. If days_to_add is 0, then add 7 days (since next Friday). Wait, (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7 should handle that. For example, if isoweekday is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7)=7 mod7=0. So days_to_add is 0, but adding 0 days would be today. But the user said \"next\" Friday, which implies the following Friday, not today. So if today is Friday, days_to_add should be 7 days. So perhaps the formula should be (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7, but if the result is 0, then add 7 days. Wait, let's test:\n\nIf isoweekday is 5: (5-5 +7) =7 mod7=0 → days_to_add=0. But adding 0 days would be same day. So to get next Friday, if today is Friday, days_to_add should be 7. So maybe adjust the formula to (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7 + (if result is 0, then 7 else 0). Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe shift by 7 days if it's the same day.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the next Friday as follows:\n\nIf today is Friday, add 7 days. Otherwise, add (5 - isoweekday) days if positive, else add (5 - isoweekday +7). Let me think:\n\nFor example:\n\nToday is Thursday (4): 5-4=1 day, so add 1 day → Friday.\n\nToday is Friday (5): add 7 days to get next Friday.\n\nToday is Saturday (6): 5-6 = -1, so -1 +7=6 days to add. So 6 days after Saturday is next Friday.\n\nYes, that works. So the formula days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. But if the result is 0, that means same day (Friday), so add 7 days instead. Wait, (5 -5 +7) mod7=7 mod7=0, so days_to_add is 0. So in that case, add 7 days. So perhaps days_to_add = ((5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7) + 7 if (5 - isoweekday +7) %7 ==0 else ((5 - isoweekday +7) %7). Wait, no, that would be adding 7 days even if it's already Friday. Let me think again.\n\nThe user wants next Friday. If today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days. If today is Thursday, next Friday is tomorrow. So the formula should be:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - isoweekday) if (isoweekday <5) then 5 - isoweekday else (5 - isoweekday +7 + 1?) Hmm, maybe better to use:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 7) %7\n\nWait:\n\nFor isoweekday 5 (Friday): (5-5 +7) mod7=7 mod7=0 → days_to_add=0. But that's same day. But the user wants next Friday, so if today is Friday, days_to_add should be 7. So the formula gives 0, which is not correct.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula is:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - isoweekday + 6) %7 +1\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe another approach. Let's consider:\n\nThe next Friday is the first Friday after today. So:\n\nIf today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days.\n\nElse, calculate days until next Friday.\n\nSo:\n\nif isoweekday <5: days_to_add =5 - isoweekday\n\nif isoweekday >5: days_to_add= (7 - isoweekday +5)\n\nWait:\n\nMonday (1): 5-1=4 days.\n\nTuesday (2): 3 days.\n\nWednesday (3): 2 days.\n\nThursday (4): 1 day.\n\nFriday (5): 7 days (since next Friday is in 7 days).\n\nSaturday (6): 7-6 +5? No. Wait Saturday to next Friday is 6 days (6 →7(Sun), 1(Mon)... 6 days.\n\nWait, Saturday to Friday is 6 days.\n\nSo for isoweekday 6: 6 days.\n\nFor isoweekday 7 (Sunday): 5 days (Sunday → next Friday is 5 days).\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nif isoweekday <5: 5 - isoweekday\n\nif isoweekday ==5: 7\n\nif isoweekday ==6:6\n\nif isoweekday ==7:5\n\nBut how to express that in a formula? Maybe days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday) if isoweekday <5 else (5 - isoweekday +7 +1). Wait:\n\nWait, for isoweekday 5: 5-5=0, so if that's the case, add 7.\n\nFor isoweekday 6: 5-6= -1, adding 7 gives 6.\n\nFor isoweekday7:5-7=-2, adding 7 gives5.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - isoweekday) if (5 - isoweekday) >0 else (5 - isoweekday +7)\n\nWait:\n\n(5 - isoweekday) when isoweekday is 5: 0, so add 7 → days_to_add =7\n\nWhen isoweekday is6:5-6",
