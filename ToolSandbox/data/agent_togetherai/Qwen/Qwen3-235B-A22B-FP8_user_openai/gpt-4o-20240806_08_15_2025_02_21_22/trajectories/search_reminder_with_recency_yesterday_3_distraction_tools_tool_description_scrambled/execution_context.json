                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nFirst, there's the search_reminder function. It allows searching by various parameters like reminder_id, content, creation timestamps, reminder timestamps, and location coordinates. Since the user didn't specify a particular ID or content, maybe I should focus on the timestamp parameters.\n\nThe user mentioned \"yesterday,\" so I need to determine the time range for yesterday. To do that, I probably need the current timestamp. There's a get_current_timestamp function that can give me the current POSIX timestamp. Once I have that, I can calculate the start and end of yesterday in terms of timestamps.\n\nWait, how do I get the start of yesterday? Let's say the current timestamp is now. If I subtract 24 hours from now, that would give me the timestamp for 24 hours ago. But to get the start of yesterday, maybe I need to go back to midnight of the previous day. Hmm, perhaps using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to break down the current timestamp into date and time components, adjust the day, then convert back to a timestamp. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, shift_timestamp could help. For example, take the current timestamp and subtract one day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago. But the user wants all of yesterday, so from midnight to midnight.\n\nWait, maybe I should get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours prior. Then, the lower bound would be the start of that day, and the upper bound would be the end of that day. Let me think. For example, if today is Monday, then yesterday is Sunday. The start of Sunday would be midnight on Sunday, and the end would be just before midnight on Monday. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, using shift_timestamp on the current timestamp, subtract one day to get yesterday's date. Then, set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. But how do I get those exact timestamps?\n\nWait, maybe first get the current timestamp with get_current_timestamp. Then subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's yesterday at the same time. Then, to get the start of that day, subtract the hours, minutes, and seconds from that timestamp. For example, if the current timestamp is 2023-10-05 15:00:00, subtracting 24 hours gives 2023-10-04 15:00:00. To get the start of October 4th, subtract 15 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds. Wait, but how to get the exact start of the day?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the user just wants reminders where the creation date or the reminder date is within the past 24 hours. But the question is \"yesterday,\" which is the entire day before today, not just the last 24 hours. So I need to define the time range from midnight of the day before today to midnight of today.\n\nTo get that range, I can use the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, subtract one day, set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound, and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. Then convert those datetime info back to timestamps.\n\nBut how to do that step by step. Let's outline:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Convert current_ts to datetime_info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Let's call this current_dt.\n3. Subtract one day from current_dt. If the day is 1, then go to previous month, etc. But the function shift_timestamp might handle this. Alternatively, create a new datetime_info with day = current_dt['day'] -1. But need to handle month/year transitions. Maybe shift_timestamp can help here. For example, shift_timestamp(current_ts, days=-1) gives a timestamp exactly 24 hours before now, but that's not exactly the start of yesterday. Wait, no: if the current time is 3 PM today, shifting back a day would be 3 PM yesterday. To get the start of yesterday, we need to adjust to midnight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using datetime_info_to_timestamp function. For example:\n\nIf current_dt is 2023-10-05 15:00:00:\n\n- Create a new datetime_info for yesterday's date but time 00:00:00. So year=2023, month=10, day=4, hour=0, minute=0, second=0. Convert that to timestamp for lowerbound.\n\nSimilarly, upperbound would be year=2023, month=10, day=4, hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nBut how to get that day?\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n2. Convert to datetime_info (current_dt) to get today's date.\n3. Subtract one day from current_dt to get yesterday's date. For example, if current_dt's day is 5, subtract 1 to get 4. If it's the first day of the month, adjust month and year accordingly. But how to handle that? The shift_timestamp function might not be precise here. Alternatively, create a new datetime_info with day = current_dt['day'] -1. If day is 1, then month becomes previous month, etc. But without a function to handle date arithmetic, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to subtract 24 hours from current_ts, then convert to datetime_info to get yesterday's date (but adjusted to midnight). Wait, here's a possible approach:\n\n- Take current_ts, subtract 24 hours to get yesterday_ts.\n- Convert yesterday_ts to datetime_info, which gives the date and time of yesterday at the same time as current_ts minus 24 hours.\n- To get the start of yesterday, set the hour, minute, second to 0 in that datetime_info and convert to timestamp for lowerbound.\n- To get the end of yesterday, set the hour to 23, minute 59, second 59 in that datetime_info and convert to timestamp for upperbound.\n\nWait, but converting yesterday_ts (which is current_ts - 24 hours) to datetime_info would give the exact time 24 hours prior. For example, if current_ts is 2023-10-05 15:00:00, then yesterday_ts is 2023-10-04 15:00:00. Converting that to datetime_info would give day=4, hour=15, etc. Then setting hour, minute, second to 0 would give 2023-10-04 00:00:00 as the lower bound. Then upper bound would be 2023-10-04 23:59:59. That way, the time range covers all of yesterday.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n2. Shift it back by 24 hours to get yesterday_ts (which is current_ts - 24*3600 seconds).\n3. Convert yesterday_ts to datetime_info (dt_info_yesterday).\n4. Modify dt_info_yesterday to set hour=0, minute=0, second=0. Convert this to lowerbound_timestamp.\n5. Modify dt_info_yesterday to set hour=23, minute=59, second=59. Convert this to upperbound_timestamp.\n\nBut how to perform steps 4 and 5? For that, I need to call datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the modified datetime_info. But first, I need to get the components from the timestamp_to_datetime_info function.\n\nPutting this into function calls:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n\nThen, shift_timestamp(current_ts, days=-1) to get yesterday_ts.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So shifting the current timestamp by days=-1 would subtract 24 hours.\n\nBut maybe the user's system timezone affects this, but since the functions use POSIX timestamps, which are in UTC, perhaps that's handled. However, the user's local time might be considered, but the functions don't account for that. So assuming that the timestamps are handled correctly.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info on yesterday_ts to get dt_info_yesterday.\n\nThen, create a new datetime_info with the same year, month, day as dt_info_yesterday, but hour=0, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that to lowerbound_timestamp via datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSimilarly, create another datetime_info with hour=23, minute=59, second=59, same date, and convert to upperbound_timestamp.\n\nOnce I have lowerbound and upperbound, I can use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound set to these values. Alternatively, if the reminder is supposed to be reminded at a certain time, maybe the reminder_timestamp should be used instead. The user's question is about reminders from yesterday. The exact meaning is a bit ambiguous: are they reminders created yesterday, or reminders that are scheduled for yesterday?\n\nThe original question is \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which could mean reminders that are scheduled for yesterday, regardless of when they were created. For example, if a reminder was set for yesterday but created earlier. So perhaps",
