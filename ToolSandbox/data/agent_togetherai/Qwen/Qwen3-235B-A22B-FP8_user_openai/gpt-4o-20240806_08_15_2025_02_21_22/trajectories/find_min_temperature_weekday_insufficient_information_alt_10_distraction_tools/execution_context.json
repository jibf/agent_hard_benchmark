However, none of the tools provided are for fetching live weather data. \n\nWait a minute, maybe the user expects a conversion once the temperature is known. But since I can't retrieve the actual temperature, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to use another function, but looking at the list, the other tools are for currency, holidays, timestamps, and location searches. None of these help with weather. \n\nGiven that, I should inform the user that I can't access real-time weather data. However, if they provide a temperature in one unit and want it converted, I could use the unit_conversion function.
