The content parameter does a fuzzy match, so even if the text isn't exact, it might still find it.

However, without more details like the exact content, sender, recipient, or time frame, I can't narrow down the search. I should ask them to provide more information about the message, such as part of the content, who sent it, when it was sent, or any other details that could help locate it. That way, I can use the search_messages function with the available parameters effectively.\n</think>\n\nTo help you find the text, I'll need more details about the message. Could you provide information such as:\n- Part of the message content you're looking for\n- Who sent or received the message\n- When it was sent (exact time or approximate)\n- Any other context that could help narrow down the search\n\nThis will help me use the search tools effectively to locate the message for you."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user mentioned they want to find a text but don't have more information. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the available functions include search_messages, which can take various parameters like message_id, sender details, content, timestamps, etc. But the user doesn't have specifics on sender, recipient, time, or content. They just know there's a text they want to find. \n\nSince they don't have any details, I can't use search_messages effectively because that requires at least some parameters. The other functions like get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, timestamp_diff, and unit_conversion don't seem relevant here. \n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a way to prompt the user for more information. But the user already said they don't have more info. So perhaps I should explain that without any details, searching isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe the system has a default way to list recent messages, but according to the tools provided, search_messages doesn't support listing all messages without parameters. \n\nIn this case, the best approach is to inform the user that without any additional information, the search can't be performed. Maybe suggest that if they can remember any part of the content, sender, time frame, etc., that could help. But based on the current tools, the functions require at least some parameters. \n\nSo the response should be that without any details, the assistant can't proceed. The user needs to provide at least some information to narrow down the search. For example, even a rough time frame or a keyword from the message. If they can't, then the tools available can't retrieve the message. \n\nI should also check if there's a function to get all messages, but looking at the tools, search_messages doesn't have a parameter that allows for a broad search. The parameters are all optional, but without any, it might not return anything. So maybe the system requires at least some filter. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that without any information, the assistant can't help. The user needs to provide at least a part of the content, a sender, a time, etc., to proceed.\n</think>\n\nI understand you might not have additional details, but without any information about the message content, participants, or timeframe, I can't perform a meaningful search. Could you at least confirm if this is a recent message, or if there's any part of the content you can recall? Even a small clue would help me use the search tools more effectively."

Since the user doesn't have any info, the search can't be performed. The other tools are for timestamps and unit conversion, which don't seem relevant here.\n\nI need to inform the user that without any details, the search isn't possible. Maybe suggest that if they can remember anything later, they can come back. Also, offer help with other tasks if they need something else.
