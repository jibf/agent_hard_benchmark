                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to do this with the available tools.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. But wait, what's the current date? Since I don't have real-time data, I should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. Then, calculate the number of days until next Friday. Let's say today is Tuesday, so next Friday is 3 days away. Then, add 3 days to the current timestamp. However, the user might mean the next Friday regardless of the current day. So maybe using shift_timestamp with days= (5 - current weekday + 7) % 7? Hmm, but I need to get the current datetime info first.\n\nWait, the steps would be: get current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to find out the current day of the week. Then calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, next Friday is 2 days away. Then shift the current timestamp by that number of days plus 17 hours (since 5 PM is 17:00). Wait, no: 5 PM is 17 hours, but if we add days, then hours, we can set the time to 17:00 on that day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants exactly next Friday at 5 PM. So regardless of current time, set the day to next Friday. Let's think: using datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Let's say, take the current date, add days until next Friday, then set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to compute that without knowing current date? So first, call get_current_timestamp, then convert to datetime info. Then, calculate the next Friday. For example, if today is Tuesday (day 2), next Friday is 5 - 2 = 3 days. If today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. Wait, how to handle that. Maybe using a formula: days_ahead = (5 - current_weekday) % 7. Wait, assuming that Friday is represented as 5 (if days are 0=Sunday to 6=Saturday). Or maybe the datetime_info has a different representation. Wait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function's output would include the weekday. But the exact values depend on the function's implementation. Let's assume that the weekday is 0 for Monday up to 6 for Sunday, or maybe 0 for Sunday. Need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that to datetime_info to get current date and time.\n3. Calculate the number of days until next Friday at 5 PM. If current time is past 5 PM on Friday, add a week. Otherwise, compute the days from today to this week's Friday. For example, if today is Thursday, next Friday is 1 day away. If today is Friday and 5 PM hasn't passed yet, same day. If it's past 5 PM, then next Friday is 7 days later.\n4. Once the correct date and time are determined, convert that datetime info to a timestamp.\n5. Add the reminder with that timestamp and content \"buy chocolate milk\".\n\nBut how to handle this step-by-step using the available functions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get current time. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and also the weekday.\n\nWait, but the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp are year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So once we have the current datetime info, we can adjust the day to next Friday. But how to compute the correct day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using shift_timestamp. Suppose the user says next Friday. Let's assume that \"next Friday\" means the first Friday that comes after the current day, not including today if today is Friday. Wait, depends on the user's intent. If today is Friday and it's 3 PM, then \"next Friday\" would be same day. But if it's already 6 PM, then next Friday would be next week. So the steps would be:\n\n- Get current timestamp and convert to datetime info, including the current day of the week (e.g., Monday=0, Sunday=6 or similar).\n- Determine the target day of the week: Friday. Let's say Friday is represented as 4 (if Monday is 0) or 5 (if Sunday is 0). Need to know how the datetime_info represents days. Since the function's output isn't specified here, perhaps the assistant can't know. Therefore, perhaps the better approach is to calculate the desired datetime by adding days until next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, the user might prefer using shift_timestamp with the appropriate days. For example, if today is Tuesday, adding 3 days. But how to determine that without knowing the current day. Therefore, the assistant needs to first get the current datetime info.\n\nSo, first tool call: get_current_timestamp. Then, timestamp_to_datetime_info. Then, using the current weekday, compute how many days to add to reach the next Friday.\n\nAssuming that the datetime_info includes 'weekday' as a field (but the exact value depends on the system, e.g., 0 for Monday, 4 for Friday). Suppose the current weekday is W. Then:\n\nIf the target is Friday (4 if Monday is 0):\n\ndays_ahead = (4 - W + 7) % 7\n\nIf days_ahead is 0 (current day is Friday), then check if current hour is past 17:00 (5 PM). If yes, add 7 days. If not, days_ahead remains 0.\n\nSo the steps:\n\ncurrent_time = get_current_timestamp()\ndatetime_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_time)\n\ntarget_hour = 17\ntarget_minute = 0\ntarget_second = 0\n\nW = datetime_info.weekday (assuming 0 is Monday, 4 is Friday)\n\ndays_ahead = (4 - W + 7) % 7\n\nif days_ahead == 0:\n    # same day check time\n    if (current_hour > 17) or (current_hour == 17 and current_minute > 0) or (current_hour == 17 and current_minute == 0 and current_second > 0):\n        days_ahead = 7  # next week\n\nThen, create a new datetime by adding days_ahead days, and set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nBut to create the timestamp for that datetime, we can use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp, adding days_ahead days, and then adjusting the hours, minutes, seconds.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_ahead days, then setting the time to 17:00:00. Alternatively, we can take the current datetime, add days_ahead days, then set the hour, minute, second to 17, 0, 0.\n\nBut the functions available are datetime_info_to_timestamp, which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ncurrent_year = datetime_info.year\ncurrent_month = datetime_info.month\ncurrent_day = datetime_info.day\n\nnew_day = current_day + days_ahead\n# but need to handle month and year overflow, which might be complicated. However, using shift_timestamp:\n\nshifted_timestamp = shift_timestamp(current_time, 0, days_ahead, 0, 0, 0)\n\nThen, convert shifted_timestamp to datetime_info, and then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but how to adjust the hour, minute, second. Maybe shift again by (17 - current_hour) hours, (0 - current_minute) minutes, etc. Alternatively:\n\ntimestamp_shifted_days = shift_timestamp(current_time, 0, days_ahead, 0, 0, 0)\n\ndatetime_info_days = timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp_shifted_days)\n\nhours_to_add = 17 - datetime_info_days.hour\nminutes_to_add = 0 - datetime_info_days.minute\nseconds_to_add = 0 - datetime_info_days.second\n\nfinal_timestamp = shift_timestamp(timestamp_shifted_days, 0, 0, hours_to_add, minutes_to_add, seconds_to_add)\n\nBut this could be done with multiple shifts. However, the functions allow shifting in all units.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting days ahead, set the hour to 17, and minutes and seconds to 0. So perhaps:\n\nOnce we have the shifted timestamp after adding days, we can convert it back to datetime info, then create a new datetime with hour=17, minute=0, second=0, same day. Then convert that to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts)\n2. Convert to datetime info (current_info)\n3. Compute days_ahead as above\n4. Add days_ahead days to current_ts to get shifted_ts\n5. Convert shifted_ts to datetime info (shifted_info)\n6. Create a new datetime_info with same year, month, day as shifted_info, but hour=17, minute=0, second=0\n7. Convert that to timestamp (target_ts)\n8. If target_ts < current_ts, add 7 days and repeat?\n\nWait, but step 3 (days_ahead) should already ensure that the shifted_ts is the correct Friday. Then step 6 would set the time to 5 PM.\n\nBut how to do steps 5-7 using the functions.\n\nSo after step 1: current_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\nThen step 2",
