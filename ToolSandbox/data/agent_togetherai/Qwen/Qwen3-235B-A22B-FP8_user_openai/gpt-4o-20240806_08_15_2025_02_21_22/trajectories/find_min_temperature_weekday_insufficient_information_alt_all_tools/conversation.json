Let me check the tools provided.\n\nLooking through the functions, there's 'unit_conversion' which can convert between units like Celsius to Fahrenheit. But the user isn't asking for a conversion; they want the temperature. Wait, maybe there's a weather-related function missing? The available tools don't include a weather API or any function to get current or forecasted temperatures. Hmm, the functions listed are for contacts, messages, reminders, location services, time conversions, etc., but not for weather data. \n\nSo, the user is asking for temperature information, but the tools don't have a function to retrieve that. The closest is unit_conversion, but without actual temperature data, that's not helpful here. Therefore, I can't answer the user's question with the provided tools. I should inform them that I don't have access to weather information and suggest they check a weather service or app for the forecast.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to current weather information or forecasting capabilities.

The closest might be if there's a location service, but even then, there's no function to get the current temperature. The user might need to use a weather service, which isn't listed here. Since the available tools don't include weather forecasting, I should inform the user that I can't access that information and suggest they check a weather app or service.

The assistant needs to respond consistently. Since there's no weather tool, the response should stay the same. Maybe the user is testing if the assistant will change its answer, but the assistant must stick to the available functions.
