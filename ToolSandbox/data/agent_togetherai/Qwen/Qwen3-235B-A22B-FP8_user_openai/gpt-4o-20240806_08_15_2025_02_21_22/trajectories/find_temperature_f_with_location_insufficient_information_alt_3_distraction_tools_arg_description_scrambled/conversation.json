So first, I need to figure out how to get the current temperature there. But wait, looking at the available tools, there's no function for weather or temperature data. The tools provided are for location search, stock info, holidays, and unit conversion.\n\nHmm, maybe I can help with converting units if I can get the temperature in Celsius first. But since there's no weather function, I can't retrieve the current temp. The user might not realize the tools don't include weather info. I should check if there's a way to get the temperature using the existing functions. The closest might be searching for a location around the Grand Canyon using search_location_around_lat_lon, but that doesn't provide weather data. \n\nWait, maybe the user thinks that the location search can give them weather info, but according to the tool's description, it returns information like name, address, category, etc., not weather. So I can't use the tools to get the temperature. I should inform the user that I can't access real-time weather data and suggest they check a weather service. Alternatively, if they have a specific location's temperature in Celsius, I could convert it to Fahrenheit for them using the unit_conversion function. But since they don't have the Celsius value, that's not possible. I need to explain the limitation and offer alternative solutions.\n</think>\n\nThe available functions do not include real-time weather data retrieval. I cannot directly access the current temperature at the Grand Canyon. For weather information, I recommend checking a dedicated weather service or app. If you have a specific temperature in Celsius that you'd like converted to Fahrenheit, I can assist with that using the unit conversion tool."
