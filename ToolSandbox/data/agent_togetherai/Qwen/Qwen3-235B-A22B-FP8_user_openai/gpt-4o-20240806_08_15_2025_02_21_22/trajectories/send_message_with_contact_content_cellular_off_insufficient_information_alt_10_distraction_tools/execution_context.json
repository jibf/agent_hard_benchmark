Maybe there's another way. \n\nLooking at the available tools, there's the search_messages function. But that requires parameters like sender or recipient IDs or phone numbers, which the user doesn't have. So that might not help here. \n\nWait, maybe the user can provide another identifier, like a person ID, but they didn't mention that. Alternatively, if there's a way to look up his contact information through another service, but the tools provided don't include that. \n\nThe user might need to find his contact info first. But since the tools don't include a search function for contacts by name, I can't do that. So I should inform the user that without the phone number or another identifier, sending the message isn't possible with the current tools. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can enable cellular service or check if there's a way to get his number through other means.

Let me check the available tools.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's search_messages which can look up messages based on sender or recipient info. But that requires knowing something like a person_id or phone number already. There's also get_current_location, get_wifi_status, convert_currency, etc., but those don't help with finding contact info.\n\nThe other functions are for sending messages, checking service statuses, and conversions. None of the tools seem to allow searching for a contact's phone number based on name. The search_messages function needs specific identifiers like message_id or phone numbers to filter. Without existing data, I can't retrieve new contact info.\n\nSo, the answer is that the available tools don't support looking up someone's contact information by name. I should inform the user that I can't find Fredrik's number and suggest alternatives, like checking official sources or asking if they have any other details that might help.\n</think>\n\nI'm unable to directly look up or infer contact information like phone numbers for individuals using the tools provided. The available functions only allow searching messages if you already have identifiers like a phone number, person_id, or other message metadata. There's no tool to reverse-engineer contact info from a name alone.\n\nIf you have any partial details (e.g., a message ID, a timestamp, or a related contact entry), I could try refining a search. Otherwise, I recommend checking official sources (e.g., public social media, music platforms) for Fredrik Thordendal's contact information. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",

The tools provided include functions like search_messages, which can look up messages if you have certain criteria like phone numbers, person IDs, or timestamps. But the user doesn't have any of those details. There's no tool for searching contact info by name or public directories. \n\nThe user mentioned they don't know where else to get the info. So, I should explain that with the current tools, it's not possible. Maybe suggest alternative methods they can use outside of the app, like checking official websites, social media, or music platforms where Fredrik might have his contact info listed. \n\nAlso, remind them that if they ever get any message IDs or timestamps related to him, I could help search then. But right now, without that data, I can't proceed. Make sure to keep the response helpful and guide them towards external resources since the internal tools don't support this action.\n</think>\n\nGiven the tools available, there's no way to retrieve contact information for Fredrik Thordendal without prior knowledge of his phone number, person ID, or message history. The tools are limited to searching messages *if you already have specific identifiers* (like a phone number or message ID), not for discovering contacts from scratch.\n\nFor practical steps, you might:\n1. Check official sources like his social media (Instagram/Twitter), music platforms (Spotify/AllMusic), or band websites (Meshuggah's official site).\n2. Use a public directory service (e.g., Google search) for musician contact details.\n\nSince this is outside the scope of the tools I can access, I’d recommend pursuing these external methods.
