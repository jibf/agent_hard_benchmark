                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the todo item they made yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to use the search_reminder function. But to do that, I need to determine the creation timestamp's upper and lower bounds for yesterday. \n\nWait, how do I get the current timestamp? Oh, right, there's get_current_timestamp. Let me start by getting the current time. Then, subtract a day to get yesterday's time. But wait, maybe I should use shift_timestamp to subtract a day from the current timestamp. That way, I can get the timestamp for the same time yesterday. Then, the creation_timestamp_upperbound would be that shifted timestamp, and the lowerbound would be the shifted timestamp minus another day? Wait, no. Wait, the user wants reminders created yesterday. So the creation_timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday.\n\nHmm, but how to calculate that. Let's think. Let's get the current timestamp. Let's call shift_timestamp with the current timestamp and subtract 24 hours (which is 1 day). That would give a timestamp that is 24 hours ago. Wait, but if I want the start of yesterday, maybe I need to adjust to midnight. But since the user might have created the reminder at any time yesterday, perhaps the safest way is to set the lower bound as 2 days ago (i.e., current time minus 2 days) and upper bound as current time minus 0 days. Wait, no. Wait, if the user created it yesterday, the creation time should be between 24 hours ago and 48 hours ago? No, wait. Wait, today is day X. Yesterday is day X-1. So if I want all reminders created on yesterday, their creation timestamps should be between midnight of yesterday and midnight of today. Wait, but how to calculate that. Alternatively, maybe just subtract 24 hours from current time as the upper bound and subtract 48 hours as the lower bound. That would cover the past 24 hours. Wait, but the user is asking for yesterday, which is a full day, not the last 24 hours. For example, if it's 3 PM today, yesterday's 3 PM is 24 hours ago. But if the user created a reminder at 9 AM yesterday, that would be between 24 and 48 hours ago. Wait, maybe the user's definition of \"yesterday\" is any time in the previous calendar day. So to get that, we need to find the start and end of yesterday in terms of the user's local time. But since we don't have timezone info, maybe we can approximate by using the current timestamp minus 24 hours to get the start and end. Alternatively, perhaps the user just wants reminders created in the last 24 hours. Wait, but the question is \"yesterday\", which is a day ago. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to get the current timestamp, then calculate the upper and lower bounds as follows: upper bound is current timestamp minus 24 hours (i.e., exactly a day ago), and lower bound is current timestamp minus 48 hours (two days ago). Then, any reminder created between two days ago and a day ago would be considered as created yesterday. Wait, no. Wait, if the current time is 3 PM today, then yesterday's 3 PM is 24 hours ago. So the reminders created yesterday would be between 24 hours ago (midnight?) and 48 hours ago? No, that's not right. Let me think again. Let's say today is day D. The start of yesterday (day D-1) would be at midnight, and the end would be just before midnight. So to find all reminders created on day D-1, we need to find those with creation_timestamp >= start of day D-1 and < start of day D. But how do we calculate that? Since we don't have the user's timezone, maybe we can use the current timestamp and assume that \"yesterday\" is roughly 24 hours before now. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using the system's current time as UTC. \n\nBut given the tools available, maybe the best way is to get the current timestamp, subtract a day to get the upper bound, and subtract two days for the lower bound. Wait, no. Wait, if I set upperbound as current timestamp minus 24 hours (i.e., 1 day ago), and lowerbound as current timestamp minus 48 hours (2 days ago), then the time range is between 2 days ago and 1 day ago. That would capture reminders created in the last 24 hours up to 48 hours ago. Wait, no, that would capture from 2 days ago up to 1 day ago. For example, if now is 100, then 100 - 48 = 52, 100 -24=76. So the range is 52 to 76. That's a 24-hour window. Hmm, maybe that's the way to go. Because if the user says \"yesterday\", it's likely that they mean within the past day. Wait, but \"yesterday\" could be a calendar day. For example, if today is Monday, then yesterday is Sunday. But depending on the time of day, that may vary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants reminders created exactly one day ago. But that's not likely. They probably want all reminders created any time during the previous calendar day. But without knowing the user's timezone or exact time, perhaps the best approximation is to use the current timestamp minus 24 hours as the upper bound and subtract another 24 hours for the lower bound. Wait, but how to structure the time range. Let's say current timestamp is T. Then, the start of yesterday would be T - 24 hours, and the end of yesterday would be T. Wait, no. Wait, if it's 3 PM today, the start of yesterday was midnight, which is more than 24 hours ago. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to use the current timestamp, shift it back by 24 hours to get the upper bound, and shift back by 48 hours for the lower bound, then set creation_timestamp_upperbound as the shifted 24 hours (i.e., 1 day ago) and lowerbound as 48 hours ago (2 days ago). That way, any reminder created in that 24-hour window would be considered as created yesterday. That seems reasonable.\n\nSo first, I need to get the current timestamp. Then, shift it by -1 day to get a timestamp that is 24 hours ago. Then, shift it by -2 days to get 48 hours ago. Wait, but the shift_timestamp function takes parameters in weeks, days, hours, etc. So for example, to subtract 1 day, set days=-1. Similarly, subtract 2 days would be days=-2.\n\nBut wait, the parameters for shift_timestamp are: weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. So to get a timestamp that is 24 hours ago, we can subtract 1 day. So the function call would be shift_timestamp with the current timestamp and days=-1. Then, the upper bound is that shifted timestamp, and the lower bound would be shifted timestamp minus another day (so another -1 day). Wait, no. Wait, the upper bound should be the current timestamp minus 0 days (now), and the lower bound is current timestamp minus 2 days. No. Wait, no. Let me think again. The user wants reminders created yesterday. So the creation_timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday. But how to represent that with upper and lower bounds. If I set the upperbound to current timestamp minus 24 hours (i.e., 1 day ago) and lowerbound to current timestamp minus 48 hours (2 days ago), then the range is from 2 days ago to 1 day ago. That would cover exactly the 24-hour period that ended 1 day ago. Which would correspond to \"yesterday\" if the current time is near midnight. But maybe it's not perfect, but given the available tools, this is the best approximation possible.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n\n2. Call shift_timestamp with T and days=-1 to get T_1 (24 hours ago).\n\n3. Call shift_timestamp with T and days=-2 to get T_2 (48 hours ago).\n\nThen, set creation_timestamp_upperbound = T_1, creation_timestamp_lowerbound = T_2.\n\nThen, call search_reminder with these bounds. Also, since the user is asking for their own todo items, maybe they are the reminder_id? Wait, but the user didn't specify their own ID. The reminder_id is a unique identifier for the person. However, in the user's query, there's no mention of an ID. So perhaps the user's identity is known implicitly, but since the function requires an exact match, and the user didn't provide it, maybe we can't include reminder_id. Alternatively, maybe the system has a way to know the current user's ID. But since the user hasn't provided it, and the function requires exact match, we can't assume that. Therefore, perhaps we should omit reminder_id, unless the user has previously provided it. But in this case, the user hasn't, so we can't include it. Therefore, the search_reminder will not filter by reminder_id, which may return todos from all users, but maybe in this context, the user is the only one using the system. Alternatively, perhaps the system is",
