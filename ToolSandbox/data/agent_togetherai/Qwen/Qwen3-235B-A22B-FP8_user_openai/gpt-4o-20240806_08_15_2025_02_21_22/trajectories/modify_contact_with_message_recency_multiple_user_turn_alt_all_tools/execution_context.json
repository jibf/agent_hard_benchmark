I can't proceed without that. They might not know it. Should I ask them to provide the person_id or maybe search for the contact first using search_contacts? \n\nBut the user's message is straightforward: \"change someone's phone number\". They might expect me to know which contact, but without the ID, I can't. So I should prompt them to provide the person_id or maybe the name and phone number to search for the contact first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the search_contacts function to find the contact by name or existing phone number, then use modify_contact. But the current step is to call the necessary function. Since modify_contact requires person_id, and the user hasn't provided it, I should ask for clarification. \n\nSo the correct approach is to respond by asking the user to provide the person_id of the contact they want to update. Alternatively, if they don't know it, suggest using search_contacts first. But according to the instructions, I should ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. \n\nTherefore, I should respond by asking the user to specify the person_id of the contact whose phone number they want to change.

So, I need to figure out how to help them find the right contact without much info.\n\nFirst, the modify_contact function requires person_id, which they don't have. So the next step is to search for the contact. But how? The search_contacts function can use name, phone number, or relationship. Since the user doesn't remember the name or phone, maybe they can provide some clues.\n\nWait, the user said they can't remember who they talked to last. Maybe they need help retrieving recent contacts. However, the search_contacts function doesn't have a parameter for conversation history. The available functions include search_messages, which can look up messages by sender or recipient phone numbers. But without the phone number, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can provide partial info. The search_contacts function allows fuzzy matching on name or relationship. If they can give a partial name or describe the relationship, I could use that. For example, if they say \"my brother\" or \"John\", even if it's not exact, the fuzzy match might find it.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any details yet. So the response should prompt them to give any possible information, like a name, relationship, or any other details. That way, I can use the search_contacts function with the available parameters to find possible matches. Once found, we can get the person_id and proceed with modify_contact.\n\nSo, the plan is to ask the user for any details they can remember about the contact, even if it's vague. Then use that info to search contacts, get the person_id, and then modify the phone number. Since the user might not have enough info, the response should be helpful and guide them to provide what they can.\n</think>\n\nTo help you find the right contact without knowing the `person_id`, I can search for contacts based on **any details you remember** (e.g., name, relationship, or even a partial phone number). For example:\n\n- \"Update the number for my friend Alex\"\n- \"Change the number for someone I called last week\"\n- \"Modify the contact with phone number 555-1234\"\n\nCould you provide any of these details? If not, I can also check your recent messages to identify possible contacts.",
