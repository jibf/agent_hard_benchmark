I first tried to search for the location using the search_location_around_lat_lon function, but there was a connection error because the Wi-Fi isn't enabled. So, I need to check if the user wants to enable the Wi-Fi to proceed. Let me confirm the Wi-Fi status and ask for their preference.\n\nWait, the error message says \"Wifi is not enabled.\" So the search_location function requires Wi-Fi. Since the user didn't specify, I should check if they want to turn on Wi-Fi. But maybe I should first check the current Wi-Fi status using get_wifi_status to see if it's off. But the error already indicates it's not enabled. So maybe directly ask if they want to enable it. However, the tools have a get_wifi_status function. Should I call that first to confirm the status? But the error from the previous tool call already tells me that Wi-Fi is off. So maybe proceed to ask the user if they want to enable it. Alternatively, the user might need to know that the Wi-Fi is off and decide whether to turn it on. Since the user's query depends on getting the location data, which in turn requires Wi-Fi, I need to handle this dependency. So the next step is to inform the user that Wi-Fi is off and ask if they want to enable it to proceed with the search. That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n<error>\nThe search for Grand Canyon's location failed because Wi-Fi is not enabled.

The initial search failed because Wi-Fi was off, so I turned it on. Then, I found the Grand Canyon National Park's coordinates. Next, I used those coordinates to get the weather info. The response shows the minimum temperature is 18.8°C. Since the user might prefer Fahrenheit, I should convert that. Let me check the conversion function. The parameters need amount, from_unit, and to_unit. So, convert 18.8 Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula is (18.8 * 9/5) + 32 = 65.84°F. Round it to one decimal, 65.8°F. Present both values clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest temperature in Grand Canyon today is **18.8°C (65.8°F)**. \n\nWould you like additional weather details for the area?",

Also, the weather condition is sunny, which might be good to mention. I should convert the temperature to Fahrenheit for completeness, even though the user didn't ask, but maybe they want it.

But the user only asked for the lowest, so maybe just mention the min. Also, check if there's any rain or other conditions. The daily_will_it_rain is 0, so no rain. The condition is sunny, so that's a nice detail. \n\nI should structure the response clearly, stating tomorrow's lowest temp, the condition, and maybe the units. The user might appreciate knowing it's sunny and no rain, so they can plan accordingly. Make sure the answer is concise but informative. Also, check if there's any need for further tool calls, but since the user just asked for tomorrow's temp, and the data is there, no need for extra steps. \n\nSo the final answer: The lowest temperature tomorrow will be 14.7°C (58.5°F) with sunny conditions. No rain expected. Offer further help if needed.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest temperature in Grand Canyon tomorrow will be **14.7°C (58.5°F)** with **sunny** conditions.
