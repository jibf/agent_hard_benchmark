                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nFirst, there's the search_reminder function. It allows searching reminders based on various criteria like reminder_id, content, timestamps, and location. Since the user didn't mention a specific person or location, I can probably ignore reminder_id, latitude, and longitude. The key here is the time frame: yesterday. \n\nTo get reminders from yesterday, I need to set the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound. But wait, does the user mean reminders created yesterday or reminders that were set to trigger yesterday? The question is about \"todo yesterday,\" which might refer to tasks they were supposed to do yesterday. So maybe the reminder_timestamp should be considered instead of creation time. Hmm, but the user might have created the reminder before yesterday, but the actual reminder time was yesterday. Alternatively, maybe they want all reminders created yesterday regardless of when they're set. The query is a bit ambiguous.\n\nI should probably cover both possibilities. However, the functions available allow specifying both creation and reminder timestamps. Let me think. If I set the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound to yesterday's time frame, that would get all reminders that were supposed to trigger yesterday. Alternatively, if I set the creation_timestamp to yesterday, that would get reminders created yesterday. Since the user is asking for \"todo\" items for yesterday, it's more likely they want the reminders that were set for yesterday, even if created earlier. But without knowing the exact intent, maybe I should check both? Wait, but the search_reminder function requires all criteria to be met. So if I set both creation and reminder timestamps, it might narrow down too much. Maybe better to focus on the reminder_timestamp. \n\nSo to proceed, I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps. Let's say today is a certain date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday is 2023-10-04. The lowerbound would be midnight of 2023-10-04 and upperbound would be midnight of 2023-10-05 minus one second. Wait, but how to get the exact timestamps. \n\nTo get the start of yesterday, I can take the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, subtract one day, set the time to 00:00:00, then convert that to a timestamp. Similarly, the end of yesterday would be the start of today at 00:00:00. But how to do that with the available functions. \n\nThe functions available are datetime_info_to_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp. Wait, but I don't have a function to get the current time. Oh, but maybe the user expects me to assume the current date based on the system time. However, since the assistant can't access real-time data, perhaps I need to ask the user for the current date? Wait, but in the functions, there's a way to convert datetime info to timestamp. So maybe I can use that. Alternatively, perhaps the system can use the current date as of when the query is made. But since the assistant can't execute code, I need to use the functions provided to calculate.\n\nWait, the user's query is about yesterday's todo. So regardless of the actual current date, the assistant needs to figure out the timestamps for yesterday. But without knowing the current date, how can it be done? Wait, the functions require parameters. So perhaps the assistant needs to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp to get the current date, then subtract a day. But how to get the current timestamp? That's the problem. The assistant doesn't have access to the current time unless the user provides it. Wait, but maybe the assistant can use the system's current time. However, in this scenario, the assistant can't do that. Wait, but the functions don't include a way to get the current time. So the assistant must rely on the user providing the necessary dates. Wait, but the user didn't mention the current date. Hmm, this complicates things. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp, but how does it get the current timestamp? It can't unless the user provides it. Wait, no. The assistant might need to use the system's current time, but since this is a text-based interaction, maybe the assistant is expected to proceed by assuming the current date or perhaps the user's query is in the context of the current date. However, since the functions don't allow getting the current timestamp, the assistant must find a way to calculate the start and end of yesterday without knowing the current date. Which is impossible. Therefore, there's a missing piece here. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a timestamp provided by the user. But the user didn't provide a timestamp. This seems like a dead end. Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by constructing the datetime info for yesterday based on the current date. But again, without knowing the current date, it can't. \n\nWait, perhaps the user's query is in a context where the current date is known, or the system can infer it. For example, if the assistant is in a conversation where the user mentioned the current date, but in this case, the user hasn't. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask for clarification. But the user's instruction says to call functions to assist with the query. However, the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current date. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the timestamp_to_datetime_info on a timestamp that represents \"now\". But since there's no function to get the current timestamp, that's not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant should proceed by assuming that the user's \"yesterday\" refers to the day before today's date, and the assistant can generate the necessary parameters by using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date minus one day. But how to get the current date. \n\nThis seems like a problem. Without knowing the current date, the assistant can't calculate yesterday's start and end. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that it needs the current date to proceed. However, the user's instruction says not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. \n\nBut the user's query is \"What's my todo yesterday?\" which is a common question. The ambiguity is whether \"yesterday\" refers to the creation time or the reminder time. Also, without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute the actual timestamps. \n\nBut maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming that the user is referring to the reminder timestamp, and that the current date is, say, today's date. However, since the assistant can't access real-time data, this approach is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can respond by asking the user to specify the date for which they want to see the todos. But according to the user's instruction, the assistant should use the functions provided. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a timestamp that represents the current time, but since it doesn't have access to that, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant should proceed by using the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound, but how to calculate those values without knowing the current date. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. Therefore, the assistant should probably ask the user for the current date to proceed. However, the user might not be willing to provide that. Alternatively, the assistant can proceed by making an assumption that the current date is a certain value, but that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create a timestamp for today at midnight, subtract a day to get yesterday's start, and then use that. But again, without knowing today's date, this can't be done. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. The assistant needs to figure out the timestamps for yesterday, but without knowing the current date, it can't. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the current date is required to proceed. However, the user's instruction says to use the tools provided. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a timestamp parameter, but since the user hasn't provided one, maybe the assistant can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can generate a function call to timestamp_to_datetime_info with a timestamp parameter that represents the current time. But since the assistant can't know the current time, this is impossible. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant should proceed by making an assumption that the current date is a specific date (like 2023-10-05) for demonstration purposes. But that's not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use relative shifts. For example, if the assistant can get the current timestamp (but there's no function for that), then shift it back by 24 hours. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, this isn't possible. \n\nThis seems like a critical gap in the available tools. However, perhaps the assistant should proceed by assuming that the user wants reminders that were created yesterday. Then, the assistant can use the search_reminder function with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. But again, without knowing the actual dates, the assistant can't generate the correct timestamps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can respond by asking the user to specify a date, which would allow the assistant to calculate the necessary timestamps. For example, if the user says \"yesterday",
