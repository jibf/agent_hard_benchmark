The available functions are add_contact, modify_contact, and remove_contact. The remove_contact function requires a person_id. But the user provided a phone number. How do I get the person_id from the phone number?\n\nWait, the functions don't have a search or lookup function. So maybe the system expects that the user knows the person_id. But in reality, the user might not have that. However, according to the tools provided, the remove_contact function needs the person_id. So I can't proceed with just the phone number. \n\nThe user might not know the person_id and might be providing the phone number, which is part of the contact details. But the system can't delete based on phone number. So I should inform the user that they need to provide the person_id. But wait, the user might have previously added the contact and knows the ID, but that's not likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the phone number is unique enough to find the person_id. But the tools don't have a function for that. So the correct approach here is to tell the user that I can't remove the contact by phone number alone and that they need the person_id. However, the user might expect the system to look it up. Since the tools don't allow that, I have to respond that I can't do it with the given information.

Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned they don't know the ID and only have the phone number. The previous responses explained that the system can't look up the ID by phone number. But the user is insistent, so maybe they need more options.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to help them without the ID. If the user can provide the name or any other details, but they said they don't have any other info. Hmm. The functions available are add_contact, modify_contact, and remove_contact. Remove_contact needs person_id, which isn't available here.\n\nThe user might not know the person_id, so the system can't proceed with deletion. The only option is to inform them that without the ID, deletion isn't possible. Maybe suggest adding the contact again to get a new ID, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the user might need to check their contact list for the ID. But if they don't have access to that, the system can't help further. So the response should reiterate the need for the person_id and offer to help with other actions if possible.\n</think>\n\nI understand your limitation, but I cannot proceed with removing the contact without the person_id. The system requires this unique identifier for safety reasons to prevent accidental deletions.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Help you add a new contact (if you want to replace this number)?\n2. Help you modify a contact if you later find the ID?\n3. Provide guidance on where to find contact IDs in the future?\n\nLet me know how I can assist you within these constraints.",

Maybe add a friendly note for future reference, suggesting they keep track of IDs or offer help if they need something else. Keep it simple and positive, even though they couldn't get the ID. No need to call any functions here since they're not proceeding with the deletion. Just a straightforward, courteous response.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome!
