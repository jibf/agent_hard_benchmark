                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my todo later?\" So I need to figure out what they need. Let me start by understanding what \"todo later\" means. They probably want to know their reminders or tasks that are scheduled for a future time.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, the search_reminder function seems relevant. It allows searching for reminders based on various criteria like timestamps. Since the user is asking for things \"later,\" I should focus on the reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. \n\nBut wait, the current time isn't specified. Do I assume the current timestamp? Maybe I need to get the current time to determine what's considered \"later.\" However, the tools don't have a function to get the current time directly. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that \"later\" refers to some predefined future period, but without specific info, I might need to set a reasonable upper bound.\n\nWait, the functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp and shift_timestamp. Maybe I can use the current timestamp by shifting 0 from now? Or perhaps the system expects that the user's \"later\" is a relative time. But without knowing the exact time frame, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants all reminders that have a reminder_timestamp greater than the current time. But since I don't have access to the current timestamp, how do I proceed? The user might expect that \"later\" is relative to now, but without knowing the current timestamp, I can't compute it. \n\nWait, maybe the user hasn't provided enough information, so I should ask for clarification. But the assistant is supposed to use the tools. Let me check the tools again. The shift_timestamp function can shift a given timestamp. If I could get the current timestamp, then add some delta to it, but how? The tools don't have a way to get the current time. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume that \"later\" implies a certain time frame, like the next 24 hours or so. But without explicit parameters, I can't set exact bounds. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to see all upcoming reminders regardless of the time. But the search_reminder function requires specific parameters. \n\nWait, looking at the search_reminder parameters, if I leave all parameters empty, the search would return all reminders, but the user wants \"later,\" so maybe the function defaults would allow that. But the description says the search matches all criteria provided. If no criteria are given, does it return all reminders? The required list is empty, so yes. But the user wants \"later,\" which probably means reminders that are scheduled in the future. So the reminder_timestamp should be greater than current time. But since I can't get current time, how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to convert the current date and time, but the user hasn't provided that. This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the user's query is ambiguous and needs clarification. For example, how far into the future does \"later\" refer? Or maybe the system should return all reminders regardless, assuming that \"later\" is just any future time. But without knowing the current time, we can't compare. \n\nWait, maybe the search_reminder function's parameters allow a lower bound on the reminder_timestamp. If the user wants \"later,\" maybe the assistant can set a lower bound as the current timestamp. But how to get the current timestamp? The tools don't have a function to get the current time. Unless the assistant can use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date and time, but that would require knowing the current date and time. Since the assistant doesn't have real-time data, this is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the query is ambiguous. For instance, the assistant might need to ask for a specific time frame or clarify what \"later\" means. However, according to the initial instruction, the assistant should use the tools if possible. Since there's no way to get the current time, maybe the best approach is to search for all reminders where the reminder_timestamp is greater than a certain value. But without knowing the current time, that's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for all reminders regardless of time, and \"later\" is just a way to refer to the todo list. In that case, using search_reminder with no parameters would return all reminders. However, this might include past reminders. But the user said \"later,\" so they probably want future ones. \n\nThis seems like a problem with the tools. Without knowing the current timestamp, the assistant can't set the lower bound. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user to clarify or provide more specific time details. Since the tools don't allow getting the current time, the assistant can't proceed accurately. \n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time. However, the assistant doesn't have access to real-time data. So this isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant must respond that the query needs more details. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant should probably ask the user to specify a time frame or clarify what \"later\" means, such as \"within the next hour\" or \"today.\" Therefore, the correct tool call isn't possible without more info, and the assistant should prompt the user for clarification.\n</think>\n\nThe user asked, \"What's on my todo later?\" which is ambiguous because the term \"later\" lacks a specific time frame. To effectively search for reminders using the available tools, a clear definition of \"later\" (e.g., a specific time range or duration) is required. Without this, the assistant cannot determine the appropriate criteria for filtering reminders.\n\nTo address this ambiguity, the assistant should ask the user to clarify the intended time frame for \"later.\" For example, the user might specify \"within the next hour,\" \"today,\" or \"tomorrow.\" This clarification will allow the assistant to use the `search_reminder` function with precise parameters to retrieve the relevant reminders.\n\nFinal response:\nPlease specify a time frame for \"later,\" such as \"within the next hour,\" \"today,\" or \"tomorrow,\" so I can check your reminders.",
