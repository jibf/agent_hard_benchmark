                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's the todo item I made yesterday?\" Hmm, first I need to figure out how to retrieve their todo items. Looking at the available tools, there's the search_reminder function. Reminders might be equivalent to todo items here.\n\nThe search_reminder function allows searching based on various criteria. Since the user mentioned \"yesterday,\" I need to determine the timestamp for yesterday. To do that, I should get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp, then subtract a day. Wait, but there's a function called shift_timestamp that can adjust a timestamp by days, hours, etc. So first, get the current timestamp, then shift it by -1 day to get yesterday's date.\n\nOnce I have yesterday's timestamp range, I can use search_reminder with the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound to find reminders created yesterday. However, the user might have multiple todo items, so the search results should return all of them. But the user is asking for \"the\" todo item, maybe they expect a single one, or they want a list. \n\nWait, the functions don't mention a todo list, but reminders might be used as such. So the plan is: \n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Calculate yesterday's date by subtracting one day.\n3. Use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound as yesterday's start and upperbound as today's start to capture all reminders created yesterday.\n4. Return the results.\n\nBut I need to structure the function calls step by step. Let me check the functions again. The get_current_timestamp doesn't require parameters. Then shift_timestamp can subtract a day. So first call get_current_timestamp, then shift_timestamp with days=-1. Then use those timestamps in search_reminder. \n\nWait, but how to define the lower and upper bounds? The lowerbound would be the start of yesterday (midnight), and upperbound the start of today. Alternatively, the user might have created the todo item at any time yesterday. So the lowerbound is yesterday's midnight, upperbound is today's midnight. But how precise do I need to be? The shift_timestamp can adjust to exactly 24 hours ago, but perhaps the user wants all reminders created in the last 24 hours. Alternatively, based on calendar days. \n\nBut since the user said \"yesterday,\" it's likely referring to the calendar day before today. So to get the start of yesterday, we can take current timestamp, subtract one day to get to yesterday's date, then set the time to 00:00:00. However, without knowing the current time, maybe using the shift_timestamp with days=-1 and then adjust to midnight. But the functions available don't have a way to set time components. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the search_reminder can use a lowerbound of current timestamp minus 24 hours and upperbound as current timestamp, but that would include the last 24 hours, which might not exactly align with \"yesterday\" if the current time is not midnight. However, perhaps the user considers \"yesterday\" as any time before today, regardless of the current time. \n\nBut given the available tools, maybe the best approach is to get the current timestamp, then subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get the lowerbound. Then use that as the lowerbound and the current timestamp as the upperbound. Wait, no, because \"yesterday\" would be the day before today. For example, if today is the 10th at 3 PM, \"yesterday\" is the 9th, but 24 hours before now would be the 9th at 3 PM. So if the user created a reminder on the 9th before midnight, it would be included. However, if the user wants all reminders created on the calendar day of the 9th, this approach might miss some. \n\nBut given the functions available, maybe the best we can do is to use the last 24 hours. Alternatively, calculate the start of yesterday and end of yesterday. However, without being able to set the time to midnight, perhaps using the shift_timestamp with days=-1, then setting hours, minutes, seconds to 0? But the shift_timestamp allows shifting by days, hours, etc. Wait, no. The shift_timestamp function's parameters are weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. So if I want to get midnight of yesterday, assuming the current time is, say, 10 AM today, I could shift by -1 day and then subtract the current hours, minutes, seconds. But without knowing the current time's components, that's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, the user might accept that \"yesterday\" refers to the 24-hour period before now. So the lowerbound would be current_timestamp - 86400 seconds, and upperbound is current_timestamp. But how to calculate that? \n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get now_ts.\n2. Call shift_timestamp with timestamp=now_ts, days=-1 to get yesterday_ts (same time yesterday).\n3. Use yesterday_ts as lowerbound and now_ts as upperbound. Wait, but that would find reminders created between now and 24 hours ago. But if the user wants reminders created on yesterday's calendar day, this approach may not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's \"yesterday\" refers to the entire day before today, regardless of the current time. For example, if today is the 10th, then yesterday is the 9th. So the lowerbound would be midnight of the 9th, and upperbound midnight of the 10th. \n\nBut how to compute that without knowing the current date? Hmm. Maybe using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp to get the current date, then subtract a day, then reconstruct the lower and upper bounds. \n\nWait, but the functions available are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: gives current time as a timestamp.\n- shift_timestamp: shifts by weeks/days/hours/etc.\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info: converts a timestamp to date components (year, month, day, etc.)\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now_ts).\n2. Convert now_ts to datetime info to get today's date (year, month, day).\n3. Create a timestamp for midnight of today (set hours, minutes, seconds to 0). How? Well, maybe shift the current timestamp by -hours, -minutes, -seconds. But without knowing those components, you can't. So perhaps another approach: create a timestamp for the start of today by subtracting the time since midnight. But without knowing how many hours/minutes/seconds have passed since midnight, this isn't possible directly. \n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by one day to get to yesterday, but that would be same time yesterday. Then, perhaps, to get the start of yesterday, but again, without knowing the time components, this is tricky. \n\nGiven the complexity and the available functions, perhaps the best approach is to use the last 24 hours as \"yesterday,\" even if that's not strictly accurate. Alternatively, the user might be okay with reminders created in the last 24 hours. \n\nBut the user asked for \"yesterday,\" which is a calendar day. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the start of yesterday and the start of today as the bounds. Let's try to calculate that.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get now_ts.\n\n2. Call shift_timestamp with now_ts and days=-1 to get yesterday_ts (same time as now, but yesterday).\n\n3. Then, to get the start of yesterday (midnight), we need to subtract the hours, minutes, seconds from now_ts. But without knowing those, perhaps another approach: shift the current timestamp by days=-1 and then set the time to midnight. But how? Since we can't directly set the time, maybe shift_timestamp with days=-1, then subtract hours, minutes, seconds. But how to get those?\n\nWait, maybe using timestamp_to_datetime_info on now_ts. For example:\n\nAfter step 1, get now_ts.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info on now_ts. This gives us year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n\nThen, create a new timestamp for the start of today by setting hour, minute, second to 0. To do this, we can subtract the current time's hours*3600 + minutes*60 + seconds. That would bring us to midnight of today. Then subtract another day (midnight of yesterday) and set that as lowerbound. Then midnight of today as upperbound.\n\nBut how to calculate that with the available functions.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter step 1: now_ts = get_current_timestamp.\n\nStep 2: datetime_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(now_ts). This gives us the current hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, calculate the start of today's midnight by subtracting the time passed since midnight. For example, total_seconds_today = hour*3600 + minute*60 + second. So start_today_ts = now_ts - total_seconds_today.\n\nThen, start_yesterday_ts = start_today_ts - 86400 (which is 24 hours).\n\nThen, the lowerbound is start_yesterday_ts (midnight of yesterday), upperbound is start_today_ts (midnight of today). So any reminder created between those two timestamps would be created on yesterday's calendar day.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions. Let's see:\n\nFirst, get now_ts via get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info to get hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, compute total_seconds_today = hour*3600 + minute*60 + second.\n\nCall shift_timestamp with now_ts and",
