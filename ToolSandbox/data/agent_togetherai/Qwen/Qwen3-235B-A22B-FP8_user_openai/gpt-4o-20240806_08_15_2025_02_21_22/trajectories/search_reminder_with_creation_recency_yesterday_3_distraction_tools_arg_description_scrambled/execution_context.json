                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the time frame for \"yesterday.\" To do that, I should get the current timestamp and then calculate the timestamp for yesterday. Since the functions available include get_current_timestamp and shift_timestamp, I can use those.\n\nI'll start by calling get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Once I have that, I can use shift_timestamp to subtract one day (or 24 hours) to get the start of yesterday. But wait, maybe the user means any time yesterday, so the lower bound would be the start of yesterday and the upper bound the start of today. So I need to calculate both timestamps.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function allows for creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So I should set the lower bound as the start of yesterday and the upper bound as the start of today. That way, any reminder created during yesterday's day will be captured.\n\nSo steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Shift current timestamp by -1 day to get yesterday's timestamp.\nBut wait, to get the start of yesterday, maybe I need to adjust hours, minutes, seconds to midnight. But the shift_timestamp function can only shift by deltas. So if the current time is, say, 3 PM today, shifting back 24 hours would give 3 PM yesterday. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe I need to adjust hours, minutes, seconds to zero. Hmm, but the functions available don't include truncating to day. Alternatively, perhaps the user's \"yesterday\" is considered as any time during that day, so the lower bound is current time minus 24 hours, upper bound is current time minus 0 hours? No, that would be the same as the current time. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the user wants reminders created yesterday. So \"yesterday\" would be from midnight of the previous day to midnight of the current day. So the lower bound would be midnight yesterday, upper bound midnight today. But how to calculate that with the available functions.\n\nAlternatively, if we can't get the exact midnight, perhaps we can take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (which would give yesterday's same time), and set the lower bound as that, and upper bound as current timestamp minus 0 hours (which is now). Wait, but that would include reminders created in the last 24 hours, which is from yesterday's same time to now. That's not exactly \"yesterday\" as the user might mean the entire previous day. So there's a possible ambiguity here.\n\nBut given the available functions, maybe the best approach is to get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower bound as current timestamp minus 24 hours, and upper bound as current timestamp. However, that would include reminders created in the last 24 hours, which is the past day. But the user said \"yesterday,\" which might not exactly align with that. However, without more precise functions (like truncating to the day), this might be the best approximation possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the creation_timestamp_lowerbound as current timestamp minus 24 hours and creation_timestamp_upperbound as current timestamp.\n\nWait, but if the user created a reminder yesterday, which is more than 24 hours ago, but less than 48 hours ago, but the current time is, say, 2 days ago plus some time, maybe this approach would miss some. But perhaps the user's \"yesterday\" is within the last 24 hours. However, depending on the exact definition, this could vary.\n\nBut given the available functions, the best approach is to get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower bound as current timestamp minus 24 hours. So we can call get_current_timestamp, then shift_timestamp with days=-1. The lower bound would be the shifted timestamp, and the upper bound would be the current timestamp.\n\nWait, no. If we set lower bound to yesterday (current time minus 24h) and upper bound to current time, then any reminder created in the last 24 hours would be included. But \"yesterday\" in the user's mind might refer to the entire previous day, regardless of the current time.\n\nBut without knowing the exact definition of \"yesterday\" in terms of hours, maybe the user's intent is to find reminders created in the last 24 hours. However, that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the user means the previous calendar day, which would require knowing the current time's date and shifting to the start of yesterday's date. But given the available functions, that's not possible unless we can convert to datetime info, adjust the date to yesterday's date at midnight, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, here's a better approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n\n2. Convert that to datetime_info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\n3. Subtract one day from the day (if day is 1, then decrement month, etc.), but that's complicated. However, the shift_timestamp function can handle that if we shift by days=-1. Wait, but shifting the timestamp by days=-1 would subtract 24 hours, which might not account for daylight saving changes. However, maybe that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nTo get the start of yesterday, we can take the current timestamp, convert to datetime info, set the hours, minutes, seconds to zero, then subtract one day. But how?\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nSuppose the current time is 2023-10-05 15:30:00. Then \"yesterday\" is 2023-10-04 00:00:00 to 2023-10-05 00:00:00. But the user's \"yesterday\" could be the entire day before today. However, depending on when they're asking, if they're asking on 2023-10-05, then reminders created on 2023-10-04 would be yesterday.\n\nBut how to calculate the lower and upper bounds.\n\nOption 1: Take current timestamp (T), subtract 24 hours (T-86400), set lower bound to T-86400 and upper bound to T. This would cover the last 24 hours. However, if the user means the previous calendar day, this might not be accurate. For example, if the current time is 2023-10-05 10:00:00, then T-86400 is 2023-10-04 10:00:00. So the range would be from 2023-10-04 10:00:00 to 2023-10-05 10:00:00. But the user's \"yesterday\" might be from 2023-10-04 00:00:00 to 2023-10-05 00:00:00.\n\nSo to accurately get the entire previous day, we need to find midnight of the current day, then subtract 24 hours to get midnight of yesterday. Wait, here's a way:\n\nTake the current timestamp, convert to datetime info. Then set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp. That would be the start of today. Then subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday. Then the upper bound is the start of today. Then, any reminder created between start of yesterday and start of today would be considered as created yesterday.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions. Because the available functions don't allow setting specific time components. The timestamp_to_datetime_info can get the components, but to create a timestamp at midnight, we would need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Wait, but there's a function called datetime_info_to_timestamp. Wait, looking back:\n\nYes, the tools include:\n\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts date time info (year, month, day, etc.) to timestamp.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T) using get_current_timestamp.\n\n2. Convert T to datetime_info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n\n3. Create a new datetime_info for the start of today: set hour, minute, second to 0.\n\n4. Convert this back to timestamp (T_today_midnight).\n\n5. Then subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) from T_today_midnight to get T_yesterday_midnight.\n\n6. The upper bound would be T_today_midnight.\n\nThus, the creation_timestamp_lowerbound would be T_yesterday_midnight and upperbound T_today_midnight.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions. Let's outline the tool calls.\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp() → returns current timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp. This gives year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.\n\nThen, create a new datetime_info with hour, minute, second set to 0. For example, if the current is 2023-10-05 15:30:00, then setting hour=0, minute=0, second=0 gives 2023-10-05 00:00:00.\n\nThen, convert that back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp. This gives",
