                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let's start by breaking down what \"yesterday\" means in terms of time.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current time to determine when yesterday was. But wait, the user might not have mentioned the current date, so maybe I should assume the current date is today's date. However, since the system might handle the actual current time, perhaps I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current date and time. Wait, no, the user didn't ask for the current time, but to find reminders from yesterday. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the timestamp for yesterday's date.\n\nWait, here's the process: To find reminders created yesterday, I need to determine the start and end timestamps of yesterday. That is, from midnight to midnight in the user's time zone. But how do I handle time zones? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume the system uses the user's local time zone or UTC. Hmm, but the functions provided don't mention time zones, so perhaps the timestamps are in POSIX time (UTC), and the user's local time is considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's reminders are stored with their local timestamps. But without knowing the user's location, that's tricky. The problem might not require handling time zones, so proceed under the assumption that the timestamps are in UTC or that the user's local time is the same as the system's.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Determine the current timestamp to find today's date.\n2. Subtract one day to get a timestamp for yesterday.\n3. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get the date of yesterday (year, month, day).\n4. Then, calculate the start of yesterday (midnight) and the end of yesterday (midnight + 24 hours) to create a time range.\n5. Use the search_reminder function with creation_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound set to these values to find all reminders created during that day.\n\nWait, but the user might have meant reminders that were set to trigger yesterday, not created yesterday. The question is ambiguous. The original query says \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which could mean either reminders created yesterday or reminders that are scheduled for yesterday. The user probably wants reminders that are scheduled for yesterday, so the reminder_timestamp should be considered.\n\nWait, but the user might have meant reminders that are due yesterday. So, the reminder's trigger time is yesterday. So, we need to check the reminder_timestamp, not the creation timestamp.\n\nSo, the key is to determine if the user wants reminders created yesterday or scheduled for yesterday. The wording \"reminders yesterday\" likely refers to reminders that were supposed to happen yesterday. Therefore, the reminder's scheduled time (reminder_timestamp) should be in the range of yesterday's day.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the start and end timestamps of yesterday's day (in UTC or local time, as per the system's handling).\n- Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to those values.\n\nBut how to calculate those timestamps?\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp. Let's call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. Wait, but how do I get the current timestamp? The system might not have a function to get the current time. Wait, the functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp. Alternatively, perhaps the current time can be inferred by converting the current datetime to a timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant doesn't have a function to get the current time directly. Wait, maybe the assistant can't get the current time unless it's provided. Hmm, this is a problem. The user's question requires knowing what \"yesterday\" refers to, which depends on the current date. Without knowing the current date, how can we compute yesterday?\n\nWait, but the assistant must have a way to get the current time. Wait, the functions provided don't include a way to get the current timestamp. Wait, but the functions include timestamp_to_datetime_info, which requires a timestamp. So perhaps the assistant can't directly get the current time. Therefore, the assistant needs to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to compute the start and end of yesterday.\n\nWait, but how? The assistant can't know the current date unless it's provided. Therefore, perhaps the user's system provides the current time context. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp. But how does the assistant get the current timestamp?\n\nThis seems like a missing piece. Without knowing the current date, the assistant can't determine what \"yesterday\" was. Therefore, the assistant needs to first obtain the current timestamp.\n\nBut since there's no function to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant can't proceed. Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But how does the assistant know the current date? Unless the user provides it, which they haven't.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the user is asking about \"yesterday\". So the assistant needs to know the current date to calculate that. However, in the absence of the current date, maybe the assistant has to make assumptions. But since the functions don't include a way to get the current time, perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume that the current date is known, and the user's question is in the context of the current date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the system's current time implicitly. But according to the problem statement, the assistant must use the provided functions. Therefore, the assistant must first determine the current timestamp.\n\nBut how? The functions provided don't include a way to get the current time. Wait, perhaps the assistant can't do that. Therefore, maybe the assistant should ask the user to clarify the date. But the user's question is about \"yesterday\", which implies relative to the current date. Since the assistant can't get the current date without a function, perhaps the assistant must proceed under the assumption that the current date is known, and use the functions to calculate the start and end of yesterday.\n\nWait, but how to proceed. Let's outline the steps again:\n\n1. Determine the current date and time. Since the assistant can't call a function to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant must use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with a timestamp parameter. But if the assistant doesn't have the current timestamp, this can't be done.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by inferring the current date. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the assistant must make an assumption or the user must provide the current date. However, the user hasn't provided that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user for the current date and time. But that seems unlikely, as the user's question is about their own reminders, and the system should handle the current time internally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the current time as of when the function is being called. But since the assistant can't actually get the current time, maybe the functions are designed to work with relative shifts.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nAssuming that the current timestamp is available, the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to subtract one day. But how to get the current timestamp? The timestamp_to_datetime_info function requires a timestamp parameter. So, perhaps the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp.\n\nThis seems like a problem. However, in the context of the tools provided, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a current timestamp, but where does that timestamp come from?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can first call the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp. But how? The assistant doesn't have access to the current timestamp. Therefore, perhaps the assistant must make an assumption that the current timestamp is known, and proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can't proceed without more information, but the user's question implies that the assistant should handle it with the available functions. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should proceed by first converting the current time to a timestamp, but since the assistant doesn't have access to the current time, this is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the assistant to use the current time as a reference, even if the functions don't explicitly allow getting the current time. For example, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp parameter that's derived from a previous step.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create a timestamp for today at midnight, then subtract a day to get yesterday's start. But again, how to get today's date?\n\nThis seems like a chicken and egg problem. Without knowing the current date, the assistant can't determine what yesterday was. Therefore, the assistant must have access to the current timestamp. Since the functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed by using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system provides the current timestamp as part of the context, which the assistant can then use with the available functions. For the purpose of this problem, let's assume that the assistant can get the current timestamp through some means and proceed.\n\nAssuming that the assistant has the current timestamp, let's proceed:\n\n1. Convert the current timestamp to datetime info to get today's date.\n2. Subtract one day to get yesterday's date.\n3. Convert yesterday's date at midnight (00:00:00) to a timestamp (start of yesterday).\n4. Add 24 hours to get the end of yesterday (midnight of the next day).\n5. Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound as the start of yesterday and reminder_timestamp_upperbound as the end of yesterday.\n\nBut how to implement these steps with the",
