The required parameters are content and reminder_timestamp. The content here is \"buy chocolate milk\". But I need to know when they want the reminder. They didn't specify a time, so maybe I should ask for clarification. Wait, the user didn't mention a specific time, so I can't assume. The function requires a timestamp, so I need to get that. Maybe I should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time and then shift it by a certain amount if needed. But since the user didn't specify a time, maybe I should ask them when they want the reminder. Alternatively, if I assume they want it now, but that might not be right. The best approach is to ask for clarification on the reminder time. However, looking back, the tools provided include datetime_info_to_timestamp which can convert date and time info to a timestamp. But the user hasn't provided any time details. So, I should prompt them for when they need the reminder. Wait, but the assistant is supposed to call the functions. If the user's message is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification. Since the user didn't provide a time, the assistant can't proceed with the required reminder_timestamp parameter. Therefore, the correct response is to ask the user to specify when they want the reminder. But the initial instruction says if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. So in this case, since the user didn't provide a time, the assistant should ask for the reminder time. However, maybe there's a way to use the current timestamp and set it for now, but that's not likely useful. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to set a reminder but forgot to specify the time. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking the user to provide the time for the reminder.\n</think>\n\nTo set a reminder to buy chocolate milk, I need to know when you'd like to be reminded. Please specify the date and time (e.g., \"tomorrow at 3 PM\" or \"in 10 minutes\").",

But wait, how do I determine the date for next Friday? Let's see. Today's date is important here. Since the user didn't specify a year, maybe I should calculate it based on the current date.\n\nI should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. Once I have the current timestamp, I can determine how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, next Friday is in two days. Then, add the appropriate number of days to the current timestamp to get next Friday's date. Then, set the time to 5 PM. But how to handle the time part? Maybe using the shift_timestamp function to add days and then set the hours and minutes?\n\nWait, there's also the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. If I can get the year, month, day, hour, minute, second for next Friday 5 PM, I can convert that into a timestamp. But first, I need to calculate the date. Let's break it down. Get current date and time, find the number of days to next Friday, add those days, set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. Then convert that datetime to a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the shift_timestamp function. For example, if today is Wednesday, next Friday is 2 days away. So shift the current timestamp by 2 days, then set the hour to 17, minute 0, etc. But how to handle that? The shift_timestamp function allows adding weeks, days, hours, etc. But if the current time is, say, 4 PM, adding 2 days would make it next Friday at 4 PM. Then I need to add an hour to make it 5 PM. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function would give me more precise control.\n\nSo first, get the current timestamp. Then convert that to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.). Then calculate next Friday. For example, if today's weekday is, say, day 3 (Wednesday), then next Friday is day 5, so add 2 days. If today is Friday, then next Friday would be 7 days later. Wait, the user said \"next Friday\", which can be ambiguous. If today is Friday, does \"next Friday\" mean 7 days from now or the same day? Probably 7 days, since \"next\" implies the following week. So I need to calculate the next Friday after the current day, not including today if it's Friday. Hmm, but different people might interpret it differently. Maybe the user expects that if today is Friday, \"next Friday\" is a week later. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nOnce the correct date is determined, set the time to 5 PM. Then convert that date and time to a timestamp. Then use the add_reminder function with the content \"buy chocolate milk\" and the calculated timestamp. Also, check if the user provided any location, but in this case, they didn't mention latitude or longitude, so those parameters are optional and can be omitted.\n\nSo the steps are: 1. Get current timestamp. 2. Convert to datetime info. 3. Calculate next Friday's date. 4. Convert that date and time to a timestamp. 5. Add the reminder with that timestamp.\n\nBut since I can't perform calculations directly, I need to use the available functions. So first, call get_current_timestamp. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current date and time. Then, based on the current weekday, calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. Once that's determined, use shift_timestamp to add the days to the current timestamp. Then, adjust the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting days might not account for the time. For example, if the current time is 10 PM, adding 2 days would make it two days ahead at 10 PM. So to set it to 5 PM, maybe after shifting days, we need to adjust the hours. But how? The shift_timestamp function allows adding or subtracting hours. So after shifting the days, subtract the current hours and add 17 (5 PM) hours. Alternatively, calculate the difference in hours. For example, if the current hour is 10, subtract 10 hours to get to midnight, then add 17 hours. But that's more steps. Alternatively, once we have the date (day, month, year) of next Friday, we can set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (ts_current).\n2. Convert ts_current to datetime_info (di_current).\n3. Calculate the number of days to next Friday (e.g., if di_current.weekday is 5 (Friday?), then add 7 days; else, find how many days until next Friday).\nWait, the weekday in some systems starts at Monday=0 or Sunday=0. Need to confirm how the datetime_info_to_timestamp function returns the weekday. The problem is, the function's parameters don't include weekday; it's part of the output. So once we get the current datetime info, we can determine the current day of the week. Let's assume that in the datetime_info, the 'day of the week' is represented as 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 5=Saturday? Or maybe different. This is a potential ambiguity, but since the function is provided, perhaps the user expects to use the functions without knowing the exact details. Alternatively, maybe using the shift method is easier.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: \"Next Friday at 5 PM\" can be handled by first getting the current timestamp, then shifting it by the necessary days to reach the next Friday, then setting the time to 17:00:00. However, without knowing the current day, this is tricky. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, convert that to datetime_info to get the current year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and perhaps the weekday. Wait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function's output parameters are not specified here, but according to the function definition, the parameters required are the timestamp, and it returns the datetime info. So the output would include year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But how does it handle the day of the week? The function's parameters don't include it, but the output would presumably include it. However, since the function's description doesn't specify, perhaps we can only get year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that \"next Friday\" can be calculated by adding days until the next Friday. For example, if today is Monday, add 4 days. But without knowing the current day, it's impossible. Therefore, the assistant needs to get the current timestamp, convert to datetime info, determine the current day, calculate days needed to reach next Friday, then shift the timestamp by that many days, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert back to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to set the hour, minute, second? Maybe after shifting the days, we can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function again. Wait, here's a possible process:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (ts_current) using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert ts_current to datetime_info (di_current) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Determine the current weekday. Let's assume that in the datetime_info, the 'day' is the day of the month, but to find the weekday, perhaps the function returns it. Wait, the parameters for the timestamp_to_datetime_info function include 'timestamp' and returns the date and time components. The output would include the weekday, but since the function's parameters don't specify, maybe in the response, the assistant can get the weekday from the output. However, since the assistant can't actually see the output, but must use the functions, perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant can use the current date, add days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, add 2 days. But how to calculate that without knowing the current day? Not possible. Therefore, the assistant must first get the current timestamp, convert to datetime info to find the current day of the week. But since the assistant can't process the actual data, it must make function calls to get that data.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n- Then, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get the current date and time details, including the day of the week. Wait, but the parameters for timestamp_to_datetime_info only require the timestamp. The output would include year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But how to get the day of the week? The function's description doesn't mention it. This is a problem. If the datetime_info doesn't include the day of the week, then the assistant can't directly determine it. In that case, perhaps the assistant can't compute the next Friday accurately and needs to make assumptions or use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a combination of days to reach the desired day. But without knowing the current day, this is challenging. This seems like a limitation. Perhaps the assistant should proceed under the assumption that \"next Friday\" means 7 days from now if today is Friday, or calculate the days until the next Friday. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the user might mean the",
