                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by breaking down what \"yesterday\" means in terms of timestamps.\n\nFirst, I should get the current POSIX timestamp to know the present time. The function get_current_timestamp can do that. Once I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday. \n\nTo get yesterday's start time, I need to subtract a day from the current timestamp. But wait, using the shift_timestamp function would help here. If I take the current timestamp and shift it back by one day, that gives me the start of yesterday. Wait, no—actually, the start of yesterday would be 24 hours before the current time, but if it's 3 PM now, then yesterday's start would be 3 PM minus 24 hours. Hmm, maybe I should first get the current timestamp, then subtract 24 hours (which is 86400 seconds) to get a timestamp that's exactly one day ago. Then, to get the start of that day (midnight), I might need to adjust hours, minutes, and seconds to zero. Wait, but how does the shift_timestamp function work? The function allows shifting by weeks, days, hours, etc. So maybe to get the start of yesterday, I can first get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get a time that's 24 hours prior. But that would give me the same time as now, but a day ago. To get the start of yesterday (midnight), I might need to first shift back to yesterday's date, then set the time to 00:00:00. But how can I do that with the available functions?\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday. Yesterday starts at midnight and ends at 23:59:59. So the lower bound would be midnight of the day before today, and the upper bound would be the next midnight minus one second. To get midnight of yesterday, I can take the current timestamp, shift it back by one day, then set the hours, minutes, and seconds to zero. Wait, but how? The shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, but not adjusting the time components. Hmm. Maybe another approach: get the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's one day ago. Then, convert that timestamp to a datetime, set hours, minutes, seconds to zero, then convert back to timestamp for the lower bound. Then add 23 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds for the upper bound. But since I can't do that directly with the available functions, maybe I can use shift_timestamp to get the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's definition of \"yesterday\" is any time from midnight of the day before the current day to the current time. No, more likely, \"yesterday\" refers to the entire previous day. So if today is Monday, yesterday is Sunday all day. So to get all reminders that were scheduled for any time on Sunday.\n\nBut the user might want reminders that were set for yesterday, regardless of when they were created. So I need to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp is within yesterday's date range (from midnight to 23:59:59). \n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (using get_current_timestamp).\n2. Calculate the start of yesterday (midnight) and end of yesterday (next midnight minus 1 second).\n   - To get start of yesterday: current timestamp shifted back by days=1, then hours, minutes, seconds set to 0. But how?\n   - Alternatively, take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's a day ago. Then, convert that to datetime info, set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp. But how to do that with the available functions?\n   - The timestamp_to_datetime_info function can give me the year, month, day, hour, minute, etc. So maybe first get current timestamp, then shift back by one day to get a timestamp that's the same time as now but a day ago. Then, subtract the hours, minutes, seconds from that timestamp to get midnight. For example, if the shifted timestamp is 2023-10-05 15:30:00, subtract 15 hours, 30 minutes to get midnight. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the start of the day for yesterday. Let me think: the start of yesterday would be the current timestamp minus 24 hours (which is 86400 seconds), then subtract (current timestamp's hours * 3600 + current minutes * 60 + current seconds) to get to midnight. Wait, but how can I get the current time's hours, minutes, seconds without a function? Because the user hasn't provided that yet. \n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get now_ts.\n2. Call shift_timestamp with now_ts - 24 hours (so weeks=0, days=1, hours=0, etc. Wait, the parameters are \"weeks\", \"days\", etc. So to subtract a day, set days=-1. Wait, the function's parameters are \"weeks\", \"days\", etc., which can be positive or negative. So to get yesterday's same time, shift by days=-1. Then, to get the start of that day (midnight), subtract the hours, minutes, seconds of that shifted timestamp. But how do I get those components?\n\nAh, so after shifting, I can call timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the hour, minute, second of that shifted timestamp, then shift again by hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second to get to midnight. \n\nSo step by step:\n\n- Get current timestamp: now_ts.\n- Shift now_ts by -1 day to get yesterday_ts (same time as now, but yesterday).\n- Convert yesterday_ts to datetime info to get hour, minute, second.\n- Shift yesterday_ts by -hour hours, -minute minutes, -second seconds to get start_of_yesterday.\n- Then, the upper bound would be start_of_yesterday + 24 hours - 1 second.\n\nWait, but how to compute that. Let's break it down.\n\nLet me outline the process:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() → now_ts.\n2. Shift now_ts by days=-1 → yesterday_ts (exact same time but a day before).\n3. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info(yesterday_ts) → get year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n4. Now, to get the start of yesterday (midnight), subtract hour, minute, second from yesterday_ts. So shift yesterday_ts by hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second. This would bring us to midnight of that day.\n5. The lower bound for yesterday's reminders is start_of_yesterday.\n6. The upper bound would be start_of_yesterday + 24 hours - 1 second. Which is start_of_yesterday shifted by days=1 and seconds=-1.\n\nOnce I have lower and upper bounds for the reminder_timestamp, I can call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound.\n\nSo the steps in terms of function calls would be:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now_ts).\n- Shift now_ts by days=-1 to get yesterday_ts.\n- Convert yesterday_ts to datetime info to get the hour, minute, second.\n- Shift yesterday_ts by those negative values to get start_of_yesterday.\n- Then, compute upper bound as start_of_yesterday + 1 day (but since we can't do that, shift start_of_yesterday by days=1 and subtract 1 second? Or shift start_of_yesterday by days=1, then subtract 1 second. Wait, 24 hours is 86400 seconds. So upperbound = start_of_yesterday + 86400 - 1.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let's say start_of_yesterday is midnight of yesterday. Then upperbound is start_of_yesterday + 86400 seconds (which is midnight of today) minus 1 second, so 23:59:59 of yesterday.\n\nSo upperbound = start_of_yesterday + 86399 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, shift start_of_yesterday by days=1, then subtract 1 second.\n\nBut how to do that with the functions. The shift_timestamp function can take days=1, but then subtract 1 second.\n\nSo:\n\nupperbound = shift_timestamp(start_of_yesterday, days=1, seconds=-1)\n\nBut I need to call shift_timestamp twice: once to get from yesterday_ts to start_of_yesterday, then again to compute upperbound.\n\nBut each function call must be made step by step.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me outline the required function calls in order:\n\n1. Get current timestamp: now_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\n2. Shift now_ts by -1 day to get yesterday_ts: \n   call shift_timestamp(timestamp=now_ts, days=-1)\n\n3. Convert yesterday_ts to datetime info to get hour, minute, second:\n   call timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=yesterday_ts)\n\n4. Shift yesterday_ts by hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second to get start_of_yesterday:\n   call shift_timestamp(timestamp=yesterday_ts, hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second)\n\n5. Then, compute upperbound by shifting start_of_yesterday by days=1 and subtracting 1 second:\n   call shift_timestamp(timestamp=start_of_yesterday, days=1, seconds=-",
