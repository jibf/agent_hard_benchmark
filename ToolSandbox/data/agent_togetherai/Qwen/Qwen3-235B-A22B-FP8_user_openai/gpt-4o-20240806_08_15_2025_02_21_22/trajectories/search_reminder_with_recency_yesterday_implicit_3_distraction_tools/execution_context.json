The user asked, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So I need to figure out what they need to do based on their reminders from yesterday.\n\nFirst, I called the get_current_timestamp function twice, which gave me the current timestamp. Then, I converted that timestamp to datetime info to get the current date. The response showed that today is August 15, 2025. So yesterday would be August 14, 2025.\n\nNext, I shifted the current timestamp back by one day to get yesterday's timestamp. Then, I converted that shifted timestamp to the start of the day (midnight) for August 14 and the start of the next day (August 15) to set the upper bound. \n\nUsing those timestamps, I called the search_reminder function to find all reminders created between August 14, 00:00 and August 15, 00:00. The response included one reminder: \"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\" created on August 14.\n\nNow, I need to present this information clearly. The user wants to know their todo from yesterday, so the answer should list that reminder. I should make sure to mention the content and maybe the creation time if relevant. Since the reminder's creation timestamp is August 14, 2025, it fits within the search criteria. \n\nI should check if there are any other reminders, but the response only has one. So the answer is straightforward. Just relay that reminder's content to the user.\n</think>\n\nYour todo from yesterday (August 14, 2025) includes the following reminder:\n\n**\"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\"**  \n(Recorded on August 14, 2025 at approximately 7:41 AM)\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with anything else!",

Let me go through the previous interaction to see what steps were taken.\n\nEarlier, the user asked, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" and the assistant followed a series of steps. First, it got the current timestamp twice, then converted one to datetime info, which showed the date was August 15, 2025. Then it shifted the timestamp back by one day to get August 14. The next steps converted that shifted date into start and end timestamps for the day (midnight to midnight). Then it used the search_reminder function with those timestamps as the creation time range. The response found one reminder.\n\nNow the user is asking again about reminders from yesterday. Since the previous process worked, maybe the same approach is needed here. The user might not have seen the previous answer or wants confirmation. The assistant should check if the same steps apply here. The key is to determine the correct time range for yesterday and query the reminders again. However, since the previous response already provided the answer, maybe the user is testing if the assistant remembers or knows the context. But in the given history, the last tool_response was the search_reminder result. So the assistant should probably just reiterate that there was one reminder, unless there's a need to redo the steps. Wait, but the user might be asking in a new session, so the assistant should recheck. However, in the current setup, the assistant should use the tools again. Wait, looking at the current history, the last tool_response was the search_reminder result. So the assistant can refer back to that. However, the user's current question is similar to the previous one. The assistant should confirm that yes, there was one reminder, as found before. But according to the instructions, the assistant should use the tools if needed. Wait, but since the previous steps already retrieved the data, maybe the assistant can answer directly. However, the assistant must follow the protocol: if the user's question can be answered without tools, then proceed. Otherwise, use tools. Since the user is asking about reminders from yesterday, and the previous search_reminder call already found the data, the assistant can reference that result. Therefore, the answer is that there is one reminder, as previously found. So the response should state that there was one reminder, repeating the info from the tool_response.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder from yesterday (August 14, 2025) includes:\n\n**\"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\"**  \n(Created on August 14, 2025 at approximately 7:41 AM)\n\nNo other reminders were recorded for that day.",
