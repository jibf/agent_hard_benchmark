|                       |                       |                       | timestamp is T. Then yesterday's lower bound would be T minus 24     |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | hours (which is 24*3600 seconds), and the upper bound would be T.    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | Wait, but that would include all reminders created in the last 24    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | hours. However, depending on the exact time, maybe the user wants    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |

|                       |                       |                       | today is 10th 15:00, then yesterday's reminders would be from 9th    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
