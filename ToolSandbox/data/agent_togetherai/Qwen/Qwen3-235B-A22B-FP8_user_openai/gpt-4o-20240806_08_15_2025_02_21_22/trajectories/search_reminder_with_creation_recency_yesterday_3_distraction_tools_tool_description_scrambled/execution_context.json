                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the time frame for \"yesterday.\" To do that, I should get the current timestamp and then calculate the timestamp for 24 hours ago. That would give me the upper and lower bounds for the creation time of the reminder.\n\nSo, I'll start by calling the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. Once I have that, I can use the shift_timestamp function to subtract 24 hours (which is 0 days, but maybe 1 day?) Wait, shifting by days might be easier. Let's see. The user wants reminders created yesterday, which is the day before today. So if today is October 10th, then yesterday is October 9th. So the lower bound would be midnight of the previous day, and the upper bound would be midnight of today.\n\nBut how to calculate that? Let's think. Suppose the current timestamp is T. Then yesterday's lower bound would be T minus 24 hours (which is 24*3600 seconds), and the upper bound would be T. Wait, but that would include all reminders created in the last 24 hours. However, depending on the exact time, maybe the user wants reminders created on the calendar day of yesterday. For example, if today is 10th 15:00, then yesterday's reminders would be from 9th 00:00 to 10th 00:00. So perhaps I need to adjust the timestamps accordingly.\n\nBut since the user just said \"yesterday,\" maybe the simplest approach is to subtract 24 hours from the current time to get the lower bound and use the current time as the upper bound. That way, any reminder created in the last 24 hours (i.e., since yesterday at the same time) would be included. But the user might expect that \"yesterday\" refers to the entire day before the current day, regardless of the current time. Hmm, but the exact interpretation can vary. Since the system uses timestamps, perhaps the best approach is to use the last 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, to get the start and end of yesterday's day. For example, if today is October 10th, then yesterday's start would be midnight on October 9th, and end at midnight on October 10th. To calculate that, I need to convert the current timestamp to a date, subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then get the timestamp for midnight of that day, and then midnight of the next day as the upper bound.\n\nBut how to do that with the available functions? The functions available include get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and others. Let's see. Let's first get the current timestamp. Then shift it by -24 hours to get a point 24 hours ago. But that would give a timestamp 24 hours before now. However, if the user wants all reminders created since yesterday midnight, this approach might not capture that. However, without knowing the exact definition of \"yesterday,\" maybe the best approach is to use the last 24 hours as the time frame.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants reminders created on the previous calendar day. For example, if today is the 10th, then any reminder created on the 9th. To get that, we need to find the start of yesterday (midnight) and the start of today (midnight). But how to do that with the available functions? The functions available don't directly handle date manipulations like getting the start of the day. However, perhaps using shift_timestamp with days: -1, but that would subtract 24 hours, which might not account for daylight saving changes, but maybe for this purpose, it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the search_reminder function allows specifying a creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound. So I need to set those to the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday (which is the start of today). Let me try to compute those timestamps.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp (now). Let's call that T. Then, to get the start of today (midnight), we can subtract the hours, minutes, seconds from T. But how to do that without the datetime_info_to_timestamp function? Wait, maybe using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function. But that would require converting T to datetime components, setting the time to 00:00:00, then converting back. But the available functions are timestamp_to_datetime_info and datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T) using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get current date and time.\n3. Modify the datetime_info to set hour, minute, second to 0, creating a datetime for midnight today.\n4. Convert that back to a timestamp (T_midnight) using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n5. Then, subtract one day (shift_timestamp with days=-1) to get T_midnight - 1 day = midnight of yesterday.\n6. The upper bound would be T_midnight (start of today), and the lower bound would be midnight of yesterday.\n\nBut this requires several steps. However, the user might not need such precision, but since the question is about \"yesterday,\" it's better to be accurate. But the assistant can only call the available functions. Let's check the available functions again.\n\nAvailable functions:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: gives current timestamp.\n- shift_timestamp: can shift by days, hours, etc.\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info: can get date parts.\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: can create a timestamp from date parts.\n\nSo to get the start of yesterday, perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert to datetime_info, which gives year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n3. Subtract 1 day from that datetime_info (taking care to handle month/year transitions, but shift_timestamp might handle that).\n4. Then set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound (midnight of yesterday).\n5. Upper bound would be midnight of today.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on T with days=-1 to get a timestamp 24 hours ago. But that might not align with calendar days. For example, if it's 10 AM now, then 24 hours ago is 10 AM yesterday. But the user might consider \"yesterday\" as the entire day before today, regardless of the current time.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The user's question is ambiguous. Should I proceed with the 24-hour approach or the calendar day approach?\n\nSince the user might expect all reminders from the previous calendar day, the correct approach would be to get the start of yesterday (midnight) and end of yesterday (midnight of today). But how to compute that with the given functions?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get today's date (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Set hour, minute, second to 0 to get midnight of today (T_today_midnight).\n4. Subtract one day from T_today_midnight to get T_yesterday_midnight (midnight of yesterday).\n5. The lower bound is T_yesterday_midnight.\n6. The upper bound is T_today_midnight.\n\nSo, using these two timestamps, we can search for reminders created between midnight yesterday and midnight today.\n\nTo achieve this:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp to get the current datetime info.\n\nThen, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day from that info, but hours=0, minutes=0, seconds=0. This gives T_today_midnight.\n\nThen, shift_timestamp on T_today_midnight by days=-1 to get T_yesterday_midnight.\n\nThen, use these two timestamps as the lower and upper bounds in search_reminder.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps. However, since the assistant can call these functions in sequence, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nBut since the user might not need such precision, but given that \"yesterday\" refers to the previous calendar day, this approach is better.\n\nBut the assistant needs to generate the tool calls step by step.\n\nSo first, get the current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that to datetime info.\n\nThen, create a new datetime info with time zeroed out and convert to timestamp.\n\nThen, shift that by -1 day to get the start of yesterday.\n\nThen, use that shifted timestamp as the lower bound and the original today's midnight as upper bound.\n\nTherefore, the function calls would be:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp.\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info with the result of 1.\n3. datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day from 2, and hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n4. shift_timestamp on the result of 3 with days=-1.\n5. search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound = result of 4, creation_timestamp_upperbound = result of 3.\n\nBut the assistant can only call one function at a time, so in the first step, it would call get_current_timestamp, then wait for the result, then proceed.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the assistant is supposed to output the necessary tool calls in sequence. But since the user's initial question requires this chain, the assistant needs to generate the appropriate tool calls step by step.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should return the tool calls in the order needed. However, each tool call depends on the previous one's result, so the assistant must chain them.\n\nBut given that, the assistant should first call get_current_timestamp, then based on that, call timestamp_to",
