                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to set that up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact timestamp for next Friday's 5 PM. But wait, the current date isn't specified here. So maybe I should use the get_current_timestamp function to find the current time, then calculate the next Friday from there.\n\nWait, but the user might be assuming that \"next Friday\" is based on the current date. Since the system doesn't know the current date unless I get it. So I should call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, using that timestamp, figure out when the next Friday is. However, the functions available don't include a way to calculate the next Friday directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that \"next Friday\" is relative to today. But without knowing the current date, I can't compute that. Wait, but the system can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current day of the week. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current day of the week (isoweekday).\n3. Calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. If today is Thursday, then 1 day. So, Friday is day 5 in isoweekday (since Monday is 1, Sunday 7). So, current_day = isoweekday. Days needed: (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If it's 0, add 7 to make it next week.\n\nOnce I have the number of days until next Friday, then set the time to 5 PM. So add those days, then set the hour to 17 (5 PM), minute 0, second 0. But how to adjust the timestamp accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current datetime info, set the day to next Friday, time to 17:00, then convert that back to a timestamp. But how to handle that with the available functions.\n\nWait, the functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get current day of week, date, etc.\n- Calculate the date of next Friday. For example, if today is Friday, add 7 days. Otherwise, add (5 - current_day + 7) % 7 days.\n- Then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that date and time back to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle adding days to the current date. Wait, maybe using the shift_timestamp function. For example, take the current timestamp, shift it by the number of days needed. Then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days would add exactly 24*60*60 seconds per day. So for example, if today is Thursday (day 4), then next Friday is 1 day away. So shift the timestamp by days=1, then set the hour to 17, minute 0, etc. But how to combine these steps.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current datetime info, calculate the target date as next Friday. Then use datetime_info_to_timestamp with that date and time.\n\nBut the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp).\n3. Determine days until next Friday (using the isoweekday).\n4. Add those days to the current date, then set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert that datetime to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle adding days to a date. For example, if current date is 2023-10-05 (Thursday), adding 1 day would be 2023-10-06 (Friday). However, the shift_timestamp function can be used to shift the timestamp by days. So perhaps:\n\n- Take the current timestamp, shift it by the calculated days (using shift_timestamp).\n- Then, convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nWait, but how to adjust the time. For example, after shifting the timestamp by days, then adjust the time. Let's say the current timestamp is some time on Thursday. Shift by 1 day to Friday, then adjust the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to do that with the available functions.\n\nThe available functions include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which can take year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So once we have the date of next Friday (year, month, day), then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime_info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Calculate days until next Friday. Let's say current_day = info['isoweekday']. If current_day == 5 (Friday), then days_to_add = 7. Else, days_to_add = 5 - current_day if current_day <5, else 5 - current_day +7. Wait, better formula: days_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7. If current_day is 5 (Friday), (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. Hmm. Wait, perhaps days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If the result is 0, add 7? Because if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_day | desired days_to_add\n1 (Mon) → 4 (Fri is day 5, 5-1=4)\n2 (Tue) → 3\n3 (Wed) →2\n4 (Thu) →1\n5 (Fri) →7 (next Fri)\n6 (Sat) →6 (next Fri is 5, which is 5-6= -1 +7=6)\n7 (Sun) →5 (5-7= -2 +7=5)\n\nWait, the formula (5 - current_day +7) %7 would give:\n\nFor current_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. Not correct. So maybe:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_day) if (current_day <5) else (5 - current_day +7)\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_day=5: 5-5=0 → +7 →7\ncurrent_day=6: 5-6= -1 +7=6\ncurrent_day=7: 5-7=-2 +7=5\n\nBut how to code that. Alternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day) if (current_day <5) else (5 - current_day +7). Then if current_day is 5, days_to_add is 0 +7=7.\n\nWait, but 5 - current_day when current_day is 5 is 0. So days_to_add = 0 if current_day <5 else 7. No, that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7. Let's test:\n\ncurrent_day=1: (5-1+7)=11 mod7=4 → correct.\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0 → but we need 7. So this approach gives 0. Which would be correct if we need to add 7 days when it's Friday. Wait, but if today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days away. So days_to_add should be 7. But (5-5+7) mod7=7 mod7=0. So that formula gives 0. Which would be wrong. So perhaps the correct formula is days_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7, but if that's zero, add 7. So:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7\nif days_to_add ==0:\n    days_to_add=7\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): (5-5) mod7=0. Then days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6) mod7=6. Because 5-6=-1 mod7=6. So days_to_add=6.\n\ncurrent_day=7: (5-7) mod7= ( -2 mod7 )=5. So days_to_add=5.\n\ncurrent_day=4: (5-4)=1 mod7=1. days_to_add=1.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formula would be:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0:\n\n   days_to_add=7\n\nSo with this, we can calculate days_to_add.\n\nOnce we have days_to_add, then:\n\nWe can take the current datetime's date, add days_to_add days, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, and convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to add days_to_add to the current date. The functions available don't directly add days to a date. However, we can use the shift_timestamp function. Take the current timestamp, shift it by days_to_add days. Then, convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info, then adjust the hour, minute, second",
