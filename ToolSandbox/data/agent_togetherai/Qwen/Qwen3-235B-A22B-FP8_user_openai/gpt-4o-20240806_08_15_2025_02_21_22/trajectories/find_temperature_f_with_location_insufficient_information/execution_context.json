Maybe the user wants to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit? But how do I get the current temperature first?\n\nWait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can provide some info, but looking at its description, it mentions searching for locations based on a query, latitude, and longitude. The results include name, address, category, etc., but not weather data. So that function alone can't get the temperature. The other function is unit_conversion, which converts between units. But without the actual temperature data, converting isn't possible here.\n\nSo there's a problem. The user is asking for the current temperature, which I can't retrieve with the given tools. The available functions don't support weather information. I should inform the user that I can't provide the current temperature because the necessary tool isn't available. Alternatively, if they have a specific temperature value in another unit that they want converted, I could use the unit_conversion function. But as the query stands, I can't fulfill the request with the provided tools. I need to clarify or explain the limitation.\n</think>\n\nThe available tools do not include a function to retrieve current weather or temperature data for a location.

The search function might help find a weather service's contact info if there's a business there, but that's a stretch. The user probably expects a direct answer, but without a weather API, I can't retrieve real-time data.

They mentioned they can't convert a specific temperature because they don't have the data. I need to make sure they understand the limitations here.\n\nFirst, I should reiterate that I don't have access to live weather info. Then, maybe suggest reliable sources again, like the National Weather Service or the park's website. Also, offer help if they have a specific temperature they want to convert. Let me check the tools again to confirm there's no function for real-time weather. Yep, the available functions are search_location_around_lat_lon and unit_conversion. Neither provides weather data. So, the response should guide them to external sources and keep the door open for unit conversions if they get a temperature value elsewhere.\n</think>\n\nYou're correct that I don't have access to real-time temperature data or weather services. For current conditions in the Grand Canyon, I recommend checking:\n\n1. **National Weather Service** (weather.gov) - Search for \"Grand Canyon National Park\"\n2. **Grand Canyon National Park Website** - They often have current conditions on their homepage\n3. **Weather Apps** - Like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your device's built-in weather app\n\nIf you find a temperature value in Celsius and want it converted to Fahrenheit (or vice versa), I can help with that conversion! Just provide the numerical value and units.",
