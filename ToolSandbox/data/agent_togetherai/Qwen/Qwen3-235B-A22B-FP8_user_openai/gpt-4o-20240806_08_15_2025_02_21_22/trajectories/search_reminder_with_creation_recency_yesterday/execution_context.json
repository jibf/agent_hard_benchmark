                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the time frame for \"yesterday.\" Since the user is asking about a reminder created yesterday, I should calculate the POSIX timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. That way, I can search for reminders created within that range.\n\nTo get the current timestamp, I can use the get_current_timestamp function. Once I have the current timestamp, I can shift it by -1 day to get yesterday's date. But wait, I need to make sure that I cover the entire day of yesterday. So maybe I should set the lower bound as the start of yesterday (midnight) and the upper bound as the end of yesterday (11:59:59 PM).\n\nBut how to calculate those timestamps? Let me think. If I take the current timestamp and subtract 24 hours, that would give me the timestamp for the same time yesterday. However, to get the start of yesterday, I need to go back to midnight. Alternatively, I can shift the current timestamp by -1 day and then adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds to zero for the lower bound, and set them to 23:59:59 for the upper bound. Wait, but the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So maybe first shift by -1 day to get to yesterday's date, then subtract the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to reach midnight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to take the current timestamp, shift it back by 1 day to get yesterday's date. Then, use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the date components, set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. Wait, but how to convert that back to timestamps?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Shift that timestamp back by 1 day using shift_timestamp with days=-1. This gives a timestamp for the same time yesterday.\n3. Then, to get the start of yesterday (midnight), subtract the hours, minutes, and seconds from that shifted timestamp. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, shifting back 1 day would be 3 PM yesterday. Then subtract hours=3, minutes=0, seconds=0 to get midnight. Wait, but how do I get the hours, minutes, seconds from the shifted timestamp?\n\nWait, maybe first get the datetime info of the shifted timestamp. Let's say after shifting, we have a timestamp representing yesterday at the same time. Then, to get the start of that day (midnight), we can subtract the hours, minutes, and seconds from that timestamp. Similarly, the end of the day would be midnight of the next day, which is the start of the next day minus one second.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the shifted timestamp to get the date parts, then create a new timestamp for midnight of that day. But how to do that conversion?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower bound is the timestamp after shifting back 1 day and subtracting 24 hours (which would take us to the start of yesterday), and the upper bound would be the same as the shifted timestamp (end of yesterday). Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The current timestamp is T. To get the start of yesterday (midnight), it's (T - 86400 seconds) - (T's time part) + 1 day. Hmm, this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Subtract 86400 seconds (24 hours) to get a timestamp for yesterday at the same time.\n- Then, subtract the number of seconds equal to the hours, minutes, and seconds of that timestamp to get the start of yesterday (midnight).\n- The upper bound would be the same timestamp shifted by +1 day (midnight of today) minus 1 second.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe using the shift_timestamp function with days=-1 to get yesterday's date, and then set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. However, the shift_timestamp function can only shift by deltas, not set to exact times. So maybe:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp.\n2. Shift it back by 1 day to get yesterday's date at the current time.\n3. Then, subtract the hours, minutes, seconds from that timestamp to get midnight. For example, if yesterday's timestamp is 2023-10-05 14:30:00, then subtracting 14 hours, 30 minutes, and 0 seconds would give 2023-10-05 00:00:00. But how do I get those values?\n\nAh, here's the plan:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get now.\n- Call shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get yesterday's timestamp (same time as now, but one day prior).\n- Then call timestamp_to_datetime_info on that shifted timestamp to get the time components (hour, minute, second).\n- Then shift the shifted timestamp again by subtracting those hours, minutes, seconds to get the start of yesterday (midnight). That gives the lower bound.\n- Then add 24*3600 -1 seconds to get the end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nBut how to do that step-by-step using the available functions.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Shift it by -1 day to get yesterday's date at same time.\n3. Convert this shifted timestamp to datetime info to get the date parts and time parts.\n4. To get the start of yesterday (midnight), set the time parts to 0. But how to convert that back to a timestamp? Not sure because the functions don't have a way to do that. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's question is about reminders created yesterday, regardless of the time, perhaps we can approximate that yesterday is between 24 hours ago and 48 hours ago. Wait, no. Because \"yesterday\" is from midnight of the previous day to midnight of the current day. So if the current time is 3 PM today, then yesterday's range is from 12:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM yesterday. So to get that range in timestamps:\n\nLower bound: current timestamp minus 24 hours (which gives yesterday same time) minus the time part of that shifted timestamp (to get to midnight). Upper bound: same shifted timestamp plus 24 hours minus 1 second.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp for yesterday same time. Then subtract that timestamp's hours, minutes, seconds to get the start of yesterday. Then add 24*3600 -1 seconds to get the end of yesterday.\n\nBut since the available functions are get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info, here's how to proceed:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get now.\n2. Call shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get yesterday_ts (same time as now, but yesterday).\n3. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info on yesterday_ts to get the time parts (hour, minute, second).\n4. Then shift yesterday_ts by hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second to get the start of yesterday (midnight). This would be creation_timestamp_lowerbound.\n5. Then shift that start by 24*3600 -1 seconds to get creation_timestamp_upperbound (23:59:59 of yesterday).\n\nWait, but how to do that with the available functions. The shift_timestamp function can take negative deltas. So for step 4, if the datetime info gives hour=14, minute=30, second=0, then shifting yesterday_ts by hours=-14, minutes=-30, seconds=0 would bring it to midnight.\n\nYes. Then after getting the lowerbound (midnight), the upperbound is lowerbound + 24*3600 -1 seconds.\n\nBut how to calculate that upperbound. Let's see:\n\nlowerbound is midnight of yesterday. Add 24*3600 seconds (86400) to get midnight of today. Then subtract 1 second to get 23:59:59 yesterday. So upperbound = lowerbound + 86400 -1.\n\nBut how to compute that using the functions. Since shift_timestamp can take seconds as a delta. So shift lowerbound by seconds=86400-1.\n\nBut shift_timestamp requires a timestamp and deltas. So:\n\n- Take lowerbound timestamp.\n- Shift by days=0, hours=0, minutes=0, seconds=86399 to get upperbound.\n\nAlternatively, shift by seconds=86399.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp.\n\nThen shift it by -1 day to get yesterday_ts.\n\nThen get the datetime info of yesterday_ts to find how many hours, minutes, seconds to subtract to reach midnight.\n\nThen shift yesterday_ts by those negative deltas to get lowerbound.\n\nThen shift lowerbound by 86399 seconds to get upperbound.\n\nOnce we have lowerbound and upperbound, we can call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound.\n\nBut since the user might have created multiple reminders yesterday, the search will return all of them.\n\nBut the user says",
