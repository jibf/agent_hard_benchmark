Let's see, the available functions include search_reminder, get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nThe user wants reminders from yesterday. To do that, I probably need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday's date and then use the search_reminder function with the appropriate time bounds. \n\nFirst, I called get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX format. The response was 1755241480.164484. Now, I need to shift this timestamp back by one day to get yesterday's time. Using the shift_timestamp function with days=-1 should do that. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to get the start and end of yesterday. For example, if today is the 10th, yesterday is the 9th. So I need the lowerbound as the start of the 9th and upperbound as the start of the 10th. To get those timestamps, I can shift the current timestamp back by one day for the lowerbound and use the current timestamp for the upperbound. But first, I need to shift the current timestamp by -1 day to get yesterday's date. \n\nSo next step is to call shift_timestamp with the current timestamp and days=-1. Then, I can use those two timestamps (yesterday's start and today's start) as the lower and upper bounds for the reminder_timestamp in the search_reminder function. That way, all reminders set for yesterday will be captured between those two times.\n\nWait, but the user might have meant reminders that were created yesterday, or reminders that are scheduled for yesterday. The original question is a bit ambiguous. The user said \"reminders yesterday,\" so maybe they want reminders that are set to trigger yesterday, meaning the reminder_timestamp should be within yesterday's date. But it's also possible they want reminders created yesterday. The question isn't entirely clear. However, typically, when someone asks what was on their reminders yesterday, they probably mean the reminders that were scheduled for yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be in the range of yesterday's day.\n\nSo to get the lower and upper bounds for yesterday, I can take the current timestamp, shift it back one day to get yesterday's date, then shift that timestamp by one day to get the end of yesterday (or the start of today). Wait, maybe it's better to get the current timestamp, shift it to midnight of today, then subtract 24 hours for the lower bound and use the current timestamp as the upper bound. Alternatively, shift the current timestamp back one day to get the lower bound, and then shift that by one day to get the upper bound. Hmm, perhaps using the current timestamp shifted by -1 day as the lower bound, and then the current timestamp shifted by 0 days as the upper bound. Wait, no, that would cover from yesterday's current time to today's current time. But the user probably wants the entire day of yesterday, regardless of the current time. \n\nFor example, if today is 2023-10-10 10:00 AM, yesterday is 2023-10-09 00:00:00 to 2023-10-10 00:00:00. So the lower bound would be the start of yesterday, and upper bound the start of today. So how to get those timestamps? \n\nFirst, get the current timestamp. Then, shift it by days=-1 to get the lower bound (midnight of yesterday?), but maybe not exactly. Wait, the shift_timestamp function shifts the given timestamp by the deltas. If the current timestamp is 2023-10-10 10:00:00, shifting by days=-1 would give 2023-10-09 10:00:00. But we need the start of yesterday, so 2023-10-09 00:00:00. To get that, perhaps we need to shift the current timestamp back by 1 day and then subtract the hours, minutes, seconds. Alternatively, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current date parts, then calculate the start of yesterday. \n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, take the current timestamp, shift it back 1 day, then set the time to 00:00:00, but how? Since the functions available don't allow setting specific time parts. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to use the current timestamp shifted by -1 day as the lower bound and shifted by 0 day as the upper bound, but that would include the same time yesterday to now. However, the user might want the entire day of yesterday. So perhaps a better approach is to calculate the start of yesterday and end of yesterday. \n\nAlternatively, since the user might not have specified the exact time, using the current timestamp shifted by -1 day as the lower bound and the current timestamp as the upper bound. Wait, that would include reminders from 24 hours ago up to now. But if the user wants reminders that were due yesterday, regardless of the time, that might not cover the entire day. For example, if it's 10 AM today, then the range would be from 10 AM yesterday to 10 AM today. But the user's \"yesterday\" likely refers to the entire day of yesterday. \n\nThis is a bit of a challenge. Since the available functions don't allow for setting dates, perhaps the best approach is to use the current timestamp shifted by -1 day to get the lower bound and the current timestamp shifted by 0 days (current time) as the upper bound. However, that would include the last 24 hours. But the user might have meant reminders that were set for the previous day (yesterday's date). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants reminders that were created yesterday. The question is ambiguous. The original query is \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which could mean either created or set for. \n\nGiven that, maybe the safest approach is to ask for clarification, but since the user can't interact further, the assistant must make an assumption. In such cases, perhaps the default is to assume the reminder's creation time. However, the function allows for both creation_timestamp and reminder_timestamp. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants reminders that are scheduled to trigger today (since they're asking what's on their reminder for yesterday, which could be a mistake, or they might have meant yesterday's reminders. But it's unclear. \n\nBut given the original response from the assistant, after getting the current timestamp, the next step would be to shift it back by one day to get a lower bound, and then perhaps use that as the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and the current timestamp as the upperbound. \n\nWait, the user's query is about yesterday's reminders, so the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then calculate the start and end of yesterday. For example, if today is 2023-10-10, then yesterday is 2023-10-09, so the lower bound is the start of 2023-10-09 (00:00:00) and the upper bound is the start of 2023-10-10 (00:00:00). \n\nTo get those timestamps, the assistant could use the current timestamp, shift it to subtract the current day's hours, minutes, and seconds to get the start of today, then subtract one second to get to the start of yesterday. Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current date parts, then calculate the start of yesterday. But since the available functions are limited, perhaps the best approach is to shift the current timestamp back by 24 hours (1 day) to get a lower bound and then use the current timestamp as the upper bound. However, that's not exactly the full day of yesterday unless the current time is midnight. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed by shifting the current timestamp back by 1 day to get the lower bound and then use the current timestamp as the upper bound. Then, the search_reminder function would return reminders created or scheduled between those times. \n\nBut the user might not have specified whether it's creation time or reminder time. The original question is ambiguous. Therefore, the assistant might need to make an assumption here. \n\nBut given the initial steps, the user's first query was \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" and the assistant called get_current_timestamp, which returned 1755241480.164484 (which is a specific date and time). Now, the next step would be to calculate yesterday's timestamp. \n\nSo, the assistant should call shift_timestamp with the current timestamp and days=-1 to get the timestamp for the same time yesterday. Then, use that as the lower bound for the reminder_timestamp_upperbound (since reminders set before now and after yesterday's same time). Wait, no. To get all reminders from yesterday, regardless of the time, perhaps the assistant needs to calculate the start and end of yesterday. \n\nBut given the available functions, the assistant can't directly set the time to midnight. Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to use the current timestamp shifted back one day as the lower bound and the current timestamp as the upper bound. This would cover the last 24 hours, which includes yesterday's time if the current time is after midnight. However, this might not cover the entire day. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might proceed as follows:\n\n1. Get",
