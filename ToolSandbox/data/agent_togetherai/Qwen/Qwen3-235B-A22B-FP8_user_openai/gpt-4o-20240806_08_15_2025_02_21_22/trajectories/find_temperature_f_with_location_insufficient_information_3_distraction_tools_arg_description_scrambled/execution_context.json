First, I need to figure out if any of the provided tools can help with this. Let me check the tools again.\n\nThe available functions are search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, search_holiday, and unit_conversion. Wait, none of these functions directly provide weather or temperature information. The search_location_around_lat_lon might find locations, but it doesn't mention temperature. The other functions are for stocks, holidays, unit conversion, and reverse geocoding. \n\nSo the problem here is that the user is asking for current temperature data, which isn't covered by any of the provided tools. I can't use unit_conversion because that's for units like miles to kilometers, not for weather. The location search functions don't return temperature either. \n\nTherefore, I should inform the user that I don't have access to real-time temperature data and suggest they check a weather service or app for the current temperature in Grand Canyon. Alternatively, if they need a specific unit conversion once they have the temperature, I could help with that, but the initial temperature data isn't available through my tools.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time weather data or temperature information.
