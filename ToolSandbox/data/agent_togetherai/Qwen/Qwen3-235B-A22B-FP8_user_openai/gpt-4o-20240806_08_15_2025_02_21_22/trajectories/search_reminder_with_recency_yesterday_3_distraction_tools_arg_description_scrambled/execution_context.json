                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by breaking down what \"yesterday\" means in terms of timestamps.\n\nFirst, I should get the current timestamp to know what time it is now. The function get_current_timestamp() can help with that. Once I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday. That would be the current timestamp minus 24 hours. But wait, using the shift_timestamp function might be better because it allows subtracting days. So shifting the current timestamp by -1 days would give me the exact time 24 hours ago.\n\nAfter getting yesterday's timestamp, I need to set up a search_reminder call. The search should look for reminders that were created or set for yesterday. But wait, the user might be referring to the reminder's creation date or the actual reminder time. The query is a bit ambiguous. However, \"reminders yesterday\" probably refers to the time when the reminder was supposed to trigger, so the reminder_timestamp. \n\nSo, I'll set the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to the start of yesterday and reminder_timestamp_upperbound to the end of yesterday. To get those bounds, I need to convert yesterday's date into a timestamp for midnight and then add 24 hours minus a second to get the upper bound. Alternatively, using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function could help. Let me think: after shifting the current timestamp by -1 day, I can convert that to datetime info to get the date components for yesterday. Then, create a timestamp for 00:00:00 of that day as the lower bound and 23:59:59 as the upper bound.\n\nWait, but how do I handle time zones? The functions probably handle UTC, so assuming the user is in UTC. Alternatively, maybe the system handles local time, but the problem doesn't specify. I'll proceed under the assumption that the user's reminders are stored in the same timezone as the system, which is likely UTC.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp().\n2. Shift it by -1 day to get yesterday's date.\n3. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n4. Then create a lowerbound timestamp for that day at 00:00:00 using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n5. Create an upperbound timestamp for that day at 23:59:59 by adding 24 hours to the lowerbound and subtracting 1 second.\n6. Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp between lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, after getting yesterday's timestamp (which is the same as current timestamp minus 24 hours), perhaps I can directly set the lower and upper bounds by shifting. For example, lowerbound is yesterday's midnight, upperbound is today's midnight minus one second.\n\nBut how to get midnight of yesterday? Let me think. Suppose the current timestamp is T. Shifting T by -24 hours gives me a timestamp that is yesterday at the same time. But to get midnight, maybe converting to date components and then reconstructing the timestamp.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp() to get T.\n- Use shift_timestamp with T, days=-1 to get T_yesterday.\n- Convert T_yesterday to datetime_info to get year, month, day.\n- Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create a timestamp for midnight of T_yesterday's date.\n- Then, add 24 hours to that midnight to get the next day's midnight, subtract 1 second to get the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, the lowerbound would be the midnight of yesterday, and upperbound is midnight of today minus one second. But how to calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, using the T_yesterday (which is 24 hours ago), but if the current time is, say, 15:00, then T_yesterday is 15:00 from yesterday. So if I want all of yesterday regardless of the time, I need to get from midnight to midnight.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp T.\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get today's date components.\n3. Subtract 1 day from the date, then get midnight of that date.\n\nWait, but converting T to datetime_info gives me the current date. Subtracting a day would give yesterday's date. Then converting that date back to timestamp at midnight would be the lowerbound. Then add 24*3600 seconds to get midnight of the next day, subtract 1 to get upperbound.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp T.\n- Convert T to datetime_info, which gives year, month, day, etc. (current date and time).\n- Subtract one day from that date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, subtract 1 to get 2023-10-04.\n- Then create a datetime_info object for 2023-10-04 at 00:00:00.\n- Convert that to timestamp to get lowerbound.\n- Add 86400 seconds (24 hours) to lowerbound and subtract 1 to get upperbound (23:59:59).\n- Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nWait, but how to subtract a day from the current date? Because the datetime_info is in the current date. So if the current datetime_info is T, then subtracting a day would be T minus 1 day. But how to do that in code? Well, perhaps using shift_timestamp. Alternatively, take the current date components, subtract one day, then create the timestamp for midnight.\n\nAlternatively, using the current datetime_info, subtract one day from the day component. If the day is 1, then we have to handle the previous month, etc. But the shift_timestamp function can handle that. So perhaps:\n\n- Take the current timestamp T.\n- Shift it by -1 day to get T_yesterday_midnight_candidate.\n- Convert T_yesterday_midnight_candidate to datetime_info to get year, month, day.\n- Then create a new timestamp for that year, month, day at 00:00:00.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Because shifting T by -1 day gives us a timestamp 24 hours ago. But to get midnight of yesterday's date, regardless of the current time, perhaps the correct way is to take the current date, subtract one day, then get midnight.\n\nBut how to do that with the available functions. Let's think:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp() to get T.\n\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info(T) to get current datetime components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n\n3. Subtract 1 day from the datetime components. However, this requires handling month and year transitions. For example, if day is 1, subtracting a day would take us to the previous month's last day. But how to compute that? Since the functions don't include a way to adjust date components directly, maybe using shift_timestamp again.\n\nAlternatively, create a timestamp for midnight of today, then subtract 24 hours to get midnight of yesterday.\n\nWait, here's a better approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp T.\n\n- Convert T to datetime_info, get year, month, day.\n\n- Create a new datetime_info for year, month, day, 0, 0, 0 (midnight of today).\n\n- Then shift that by -24 hours to get midnight of yesterday.\n\nBut how to create the midnight timestamp. So:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get T.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info(T) to get current date info, say Y, M, D.\n\n3. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp(Y, M, D, 0, 0, 0) to get today_midnight.\n\n4. Then shift_timestamp(today_midnight, days=-1) to get yesterday_midnight.\n\n5. Then yesterday_midnight is the start of yesterday (midnight), and yesterday_midnight + 86400 seconds (24h) is today_midnight, so upperbound is today_midnight - 1.\n\nSo:\n\nlowerbound = yesterday_midnight\n\nupperbound = today_midnight - 1\n\nSo in code:\n\ntoday_midnight = datetime_info_to_timestamp(year=Y, month=M, day=D, hour=0, minute=0, second=0)\n\nyesterday_midnight = shift_timestamp(today_midnight, days=-1)\n\nupperbound = today_midnight - 1\n\nWait, but how to chain these function calls. The assistant can't do variables, but needs to make multiple tool calls.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info to get Y, M, D.\n\nThen, create today_midnight by using datetime_info_to_timestamp with those Y, M, D and 0,0,0.\n\nThen, shift that to get yesterday_midnight.\n\nThen calculate upperbound as today_midnight -1.\n\nBut the assistant can't store variables, so each step must be done via a function call, perhaps.\n\nBut in the tool calls, each function call's output can be used in the next step.\n\nBut since the user is asking for reminders yesterday, the assistant needs to make these steps and then call search_reminder with the calculated lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut how to do this with the given functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get T.\n\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get Y, M, D, H, Min",
