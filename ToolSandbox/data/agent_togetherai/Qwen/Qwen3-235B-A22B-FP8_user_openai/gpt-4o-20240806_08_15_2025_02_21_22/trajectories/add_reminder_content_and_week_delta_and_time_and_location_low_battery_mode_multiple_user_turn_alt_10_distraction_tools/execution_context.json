They also mentioned Whole Foods, which is a location, but without coordinates, maybe I should get the current location first?\n\nWait, the user didn't provide a timestamp. So I can't proceed with adding the reminder without that. The function requires reminder_timestamp. So I should prompt the user to specify when they want the reminder. Maybe they want it now, or maybe later. Also, should I check if Whole Foods is a specific location? But since the user didn't provide coordinates, maybe they expect the reminder to be set without a location, or maybe they want to use the current location. But the function allows latitude and longitude as optional. However, without them, the reminder can still be added. But the required fields are content and reminder_timestamp. Since the user didn't specify the time, I need to ask for clarification on when they want the reminder to trigger. So the next step is to ask the user for the timestamp. I can't proceed without that information.

                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on McKinley Ave tomorrow at 5 PM. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow's date. The user mentioned \"tomorrow,\" so I should use the get_current_timestamp function. Once I have the current timestamp, I can shift it by one day to get tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the user specified 5 PM. So after getting the current timestamp, I should shift it by one day and then set the hour to 17 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24-hour format). However, the shift_timestamp function allows adding days, hours, etc. So maybe shift the current timestamp by 1 day and 5 hours? Wait, no. Wait, the current timestamp is now. If the user wants tomorrow at 5 PM, that's now + 24 hours + (5 PM - current hour). Hmm, but maybe it's easier to get the current timestamp, add one day (so +1 day), and then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to do that with the available functions?\n\nLooking at the tools, there's shift_timestamp which can add days, hours, etc. So if the current time is, say, 10 AM today, tomorrow at 5 PM would be 24 + 5 hours = 29 hours from now? Wait, no. Wait, if it's 10 AM today, tomorrow at 5 PM is 29 hours later. But shifting by days and hours would be better. For example, shift by 1 day and 5 hours. Because 1 day is 24 hours, plus 5 hours is 29 hours total. Wait, but that would be 5 AM the next day. No, wait, the user said tomorrow at 5 PM. So if current time is today 10 AM, tomorrow at 5 PM is 1 day and 7 hours later (24 hours + 7 hours = 31 hours). Wait, no. Wait, 10 AM today to 10 AM tomorrow is 24 hours. Then from 10 AM tomorrow to 5 PM tomorrow is +7 hours. So total 24 + 7 = 31 hours. But that's not right. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as tomorrow's date at 17:00:00.\n\nAlternatively, the user might mean 5 PM tomorrow. So regardless of the current time, the reminder should be set for tomorrow's 5 PM. Therefore, I need to get the current timestamp, add one day to get tomorrow's date, then set the time to 5 PM. But how to set the time? The shift_timestamp function can add days, but the time of day depends on the current timestamp. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, adding one day would give 3 PM tomorrow. So to get 5 PM tomorrow, I need to add 1 day plus 2 hours. Wait, that's correct. Because if now is 3 PM today, adding 1 day (24 hours) would be 3 PM tomorrow. Then adding 2 hours would make it 5 PM tomorrow. Similarly, if now is 10 AM, adding 1 day (24 hours) would be 10 AM tomorrow, then adding 7 hours to reach 5 PM.\n\nSo the approach is: get the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day and (5 PM - current hour) hours. Wait, but how to calculate that? Let's see. The shift_timestamp function can take weeks, days, hours, etc. So to reach tomorrow at 5 PM, regardless of current time, we can shift by 1 day plus the difference between 17 (5 PM) and current hour in hours. For example, if current hour is 10 AM (10), then 17-10=7 hours. So shift by 1 day and 7 hours. That would set the timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut how to get the current hour? Well, the get_current_timestamp function gives the current timestamp, but we can't get the current hour directly. Wait, but maybe we can use get_current_timestamp and then convert it to datetime info to find the current hour. However, the available functions are get_current_timestamp and shift_timestamp. Wait, the user might not have given the current hour, so maybe the assistant needs to calculate it by getting the current timestamp, then shifting it by one day plus (17 - current hour) hours. But since the assistant can't compute the current hour directly without converting the timestamp to datetime info, which requires the timestamp_to_datetime_info function. But the assistant can't call that unless it first gets the current timestamp.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n2. Then use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current hour.\n3. Calculate the difference needed to reach 5 PM today or tomorrow.\n4. Then shift the timestamp accordingly.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do calculations on its own, it has to use the functions. However, the assistant can chain the function calls. But in this scenario, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls based on the user's input. The user said \"tomorrow 5 PM\", so regardless of the current time, it's tomorrow at 5 PM. Therefore, the assistant can get the current timestamp, shift it by one day, then shift it by (5 PM - current hour) hours. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can set the reminder timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM by shifting the current timestamp by 1 day plus the necessary hours to reach 5 PM. But without knowing the current hour, how can we do that?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can first get the current timestamp, then shift it by one day, and then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But the shift_timestamp function can't set the time directly; it can only add or subtract. Wait, the shift_timestamp function allows adding days, hours, etc. So to get tomorrow at 5 PM, regardless of current time, we can add 1 day and (5 PM - current hour) hours. But since the assistant doesn't know the current hour, this approach requires knowing the current hour, which would require first getting the current timestamp and converting it to datetime info.\n\nThis seems complicated. Alternatively, the assistant can first get the current timestamp, then calculate the target timestamp as tomorrow at 5 PM, and then compute the difference. But since the assistant can't do calculations without functions, it has to use the available functions.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant can first get the current timestamp, then shift it by one day, then shift it by (17 - current hour) hours, but again, this requires knowing the current hour, which requires converting the timestamp to datetime info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the search_holiday function to find if tomorrow is a holiday, but that's probably not necessary here.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention any location-based triggering, just a time-based reminder. The location given is Whole Foods on McKinley Ave, but the reminder is set for a specific time, not when arriving there. So the reminder should be based on the time.\n\nSo the steps needed are:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp.\n2. Convert it to datetime info to get the current date and time.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (current date + 1 day).\n4. Set the time to 5 PM (17:00:00) on that date.\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n6. Add the reminder with that timestamp.\n\nBut the available functions don't allow setting the time directly. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function can convert a datetime to a timestamp. So if the assistant can get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, increment the day by 1, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant can't do this directly unless it uses the functions. Let's see:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n\nThen, create a new datetime with day + 1 and hour = 17, minute = 0, second = 0.\n\nThen, convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't chain these calls on its own (the user would need to provide the intermediate results), but in this case, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls in sequence. However, in the context of the conversation, the assistant is supposed to make the necessary function calls to achieve the task. However, since the user hasn't provided the current timestamp or datetime info, the assistant must first get that information.\n\nBut in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls in response to the user's message. The user provided \"Tomorrow 5PM at Whole Foods on McKinley Ave.\" So the assistant needs to set the reminder timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM. To do that, it needs to calculate that timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't compute that without knowing the current time, it must first call get_current_timestamp, then shift it by one day and adjust the time to 5 PM. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp to add one day, but then the time would be the same as the current time. So if the current time is 10 AM, adding one day would be 10 AM tomorrow. Then the assistant needs to shift that",
