                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"How many km to Golden Gate Bridge?\" So I need to figure out the distance from their current location to the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need the user's current location. The tools available include get_current_location, which gets the latitude and longitude. So I should call that first to get their current coordinates.\n\nOnce I have the current latitude and longitude, I need to find the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. The search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used here. Wait, but that function searches around a given latitude and longitude. Alternatively, maybe I should use search_lat_lon to get the address of the Golden Gate Bridge. Wait, no, search_lat_lon takes coordinates to find an address. But I need the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hmm, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used with the location parameter as \"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without specifying latitude and longitude, which defaults to the current location. Wait, but that might search around the current location. Wait, the description says when latitude and longitude are not provided, it defaults to search around the current location. But I need the actual location of the Golden Gate Bridge. Maybe this isn't the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use another service or database to get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge, but since the available tools don't include that, perhaps I need to proceed differently.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the distance. So steps are: 1. Get current location. 2. Get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. 3. Calculate the distance between the two points.\n\nBut how to get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge using the provided tools? The search_location_around_lat_lon function requires a location query. Let me check the function's description again. It says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nWait, so if I call search_location_around_lat_lon with the location parameter set to \"Golden Gate Bridge\", but without providing latitude and longitude, it would search around the current location. But that might not give the exact coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. Alternatively, maybe the user's current location isn't relevant here; the user just wants the distance from where they are to the Golden Gate Bridge. So I need to get the current location, and then the location of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nBut how to get the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates? The available functions don't include a direct way to search for a location's coordinates. The search_location_around_lat_lon function might return the coordinates if I can specify the location. Wait, but to use that function, do I need to provide latitude and longitude? The required parameter is \"location\", and latitude/longitude are optional. So if I call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", but without latitude and longitude, it would default to searching around the current location. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a location name and return its coordinates even without latitude and longitude. But according to the tool's description, it's unclear. Let me re-read the function's parameters.\n\nThe parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon are: \"location\" (required), \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" (optional). So if I provide the location as \"Golden Gate Bridge\" and not provide latitude and longitude, it will search around the current location. But the current location is needed for that. Wait, but to get the current location, I first need to call get_current_location. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get the user's current latitude and longitude.\n2. Then, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and the current latitude and longitude from step 1. But that would search around the current location, which might not help if the user is not near the Golden Gate Bridge. Alternatively, maybe the function can find the Golden Gate Bridge's location regardless of the current location. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function is designed to find locations around the specified lat/lon, but if you want to find a specific location's coordinates, you need another approach. Since the tools don't include a reverse geocoding function (text to coordinates), this might be a limitation. However, the search_location_around_lat_lon function might return the coordinates if the location is specified. For example, if I can set latitude and longitude to something, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the user's approach should be:\n\n- Get current location (lat0, lon0)\n- Search for Golden Gate Bridge around current location (but this might not give the exact location of the bridge)\n- If the search returns the bridge's coordinates, proceed. Otherwise, maybe the function isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used with a different approach. For example, if the user's current location is not relevant, but we need the bridge's coordinates, maybe the function can still be called with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and default lat/lon (which is current location). But if the current location is not near the bridge, this might not work. However, the function's behavior isn't entirely clear. If it's a search based on the location name, maybe it can return the actual coordinates regardless of the current location. For example, if you pass location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", even without lat/lon, it might return the bridge's coordinates. But the tool's description says \"around a latitude and longitude\", so perhaps it's required to provide a lat/lon to center the search. But if you don't provide them, it uses current location. But if the user is not near the bridge, this would fail. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nThis seems like a problem. The available functions don't include a way to get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge unless you already have a nearby latitude and longitude. So maybe the assistant needs to proceed as follows:\n\n1. Get current location (lat0, lon0)\n2. Use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", latitude=lat0, longitude=lon0. But this would search around the current location, which might not find the bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the function can be called without lat0/lon0, but then it defaults to current location. Wait, the function requires \"location\" as a required parameter, and lat/lon are optional. So if the assistant calls search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", without lat/lon, it would search around the current location. But unless the user is near the bridge, this won't find it. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nHmm. This seems like a limitation in the available tools. Without a geocoding function that converts a place name to coordinates, we can't get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. Therefore, the assistant might not be able to answer the question with the given tools. However, maybe the assistant can use another function. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the search_lat_lon function takes latitude and longitude and returns the address. So if we had the coordinates, we could get the address, but not the other way around. So the assistant can't get the coordinates from the address using the provided tools. Therefore, the assistant can't determine the distance because it can't get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use search_location_around_lat_lon in a different way. Suppose the assistant calls search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without providing lat/lon. Since lat/lon are optional, it would default to current location. But unless the user is near the bridge, this won't help. Therefore, this approach is not viable.\n\nIn that case, the assistant might need to inform the user that it can't determine the exact coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge with the available tools. But the user is asking for the distance, so the assistant must have a way. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can make an assumption that the Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, and use a known latitude and longitude for it. But the assistant can't assume values; it must use the functions provided.\n\nWait, but the assistant can call get_current_location to get the user's current coordinates, then somehow get the bridge's coordinates. But without a function to geocode \"Golden Gate Bridge\" to lat/lon, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant can't answer the question with the given tools. However, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used with a very broad search, but the assistant doesn't have control over that. For example, if the assistant could specify a large radius, but the parameters don't include that. So the function's behavior is unclear. Perhaps if the location is a specific name, it might return that specific place's coordinates regardless of the current location. For example, if the user specifies \"Golden Gate Bridge\", maybe the function returns its coordinates even if the current location is far away. But this depends on how the function is implemented. Since the assistant can't assume that, but needs to work with the tools, perhaps the assistant should proceed as follows:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get current lat0, lon0.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", latitude=lat0, longitude=lon0. This would search around the current location for the bridge. If the user is near the bridge, this might work. Otherwise, the",
