The system might have a way to look up the person_id by phone number, but since that's not part of the provided functions, I can't perform that lookup. Therefore, I need to ask the user for the person_id to proceed with the removal. Alternatively, if the system allows using phone numbers to identify contacts for deletion, but according to the function definitions, remove_contact needs person_id. So, the correct step is to request the person_id from the user to execute the remove_contact function properly.\n</think>\n\nTo remove the contact with the phone number +12453344098, I'll need the specific `person_id` associated with this contact.

The previous responses mentioned that the tools require the person_id for removal. So, the problem here is that the user can't provide the necessary ID because they don't have it.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a way to look up the person_id using the phone number. But according to the tools provided, there's no function to search for a contact by phone number. The available functions are add_contact, modify_contact, and remove_contact, all of which require the person_id. So, without the person_id, the user can't proceed with the removal.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to figure out the person_id from the phone number, but the tools don't support that. The functions are designed to work with person_id, not other fields. That's a limitation here. The user might not know about the person_id or how to find it. \n\nIn this case, the correct response would be to inform the user that without the person_id, the removal can't be done. Maybe suggest that they need to check their contacts list to find the ID or that the system doesn't support searching by phone number. Since the user doesn't have the tools to look up the ID, there's nothing I can do. But I should make sure to explain that clearly and maybe offer alternatives if possible. However, since the tools don't include a search function, I can't perform a search. So, the answer should state that the person_id is required and that the user needs to provide it for the removal to happen.\n</think>\n\nThe contact removal process requires the `person_id` to identify the specific entry, as the system allows duplicate entries (e.g., multiple contacts with the same phone number). Unfortunately, I cannot look up the `person_id` for you using the phone number alone. You’ll need to provide the `person_id` for this contact to proceed with deletion. If you’re unable to locate it, you may need to review your contact list or reach out to the system administrator for further assistance.",
