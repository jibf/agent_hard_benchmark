Let me check the available tools.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's one called send_message_with_phone_number. It requires a phone number and content. The content is provided, but the phone number isn't mentioned. The user might expect me to know Fredrik's number, but I don't have access to that. The tools don't include a function to look up phone numbers. \n\nWait, the user said \"Resolve any issue alone.\" Maybe they expect me to handle the missing phone number. Since I don't have it, perhaps I should inform them that I can't proceed without the number. Alternatively, is there another function that could help? Checking the other tools: get_cellular_service_status, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, set_cellular, set_wifi. None of these help with sending a message without a number.\n\nSo the problem is missing the phone number. The correct approach is to point out that the phone number is required but not provided. The assistant can't send the message without it. So I should respond that I need the phone number to proceed.\n</think>\n\nThe function `send_message_with_phone_number` requires a phone number to send the message, but no phone number for Fredrik Thordendal has been provided in the request. Since I cannot resolve this issue autonomously (e.g., no function exists to look up phone numbers), I cannot proceed with sending the message. Please provide the phone number to continue."
