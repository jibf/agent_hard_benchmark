Let me check the response data. The full_address is \"Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA,\" which gives a general location. The latitude and longitude are 37.819910899999996 and -122.4785598, so maybe mention those coordinates. Also, the description mentions it's an iconic bridge opened in 1937, spanning 4,200 feet. \n\nThe user probably wants to know where it's located, so I should include the city (San Francisco, CA) and maybe highlight that it's a major tourist attraction. The phone number and website are there, but unless the user asks for them, they might not be necessary. Since the user just asked for the location, focus on the address, coordinates, and a brief description. \n\nWait, the function response has 'full_address_array' as ['Golden Gate Brg', 'San Francisco, CA'], which might be a more concise way to present the address. Also, the timezone is America/Los_Angeles, which is probably the local time zone. \n\nI should structure the answer to first state that the Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, CA, provide the exact coordinates, and mention it's a famous bridge with the year it opened. Maybe add a line about its significance as a tourist attraction and historical landmark. Avoid extra details like phone number and website unless needed. \n\nDouble-check the parameters: the user didn't specify any other requirements, so the answer should be straightforward. Make sure the coordinates are correctly formatted and mention the source of the data if necessary, but since the user didn't ask for that, maybe just present the info confidently.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is located in **San Francisco, CA**. Its exact coordinates are **37.8199° N latitude** and **-122.4786° W longitude**. \n\nThis iconic 4,200-foot art deco suspension bridge, opened in 1937, is a historic landmark and one of the most recognizable tourist attractions in the United States. It spans the Golden Gate Strait, the entrance to San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. \n\nWould you like additional details like visiting hours, traffic info, or nearby points of interest?",

I remember from the history that they've asked this before, and I helped them by getting their current location and calculating the distance. Let me check the latest interaction.\n\nIn the last message, the user said, \"I'm not sure where I am exactly, so I can't determine the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge.\" Then I called get_current_location, which gave the coordinates 37.334606, -122.009102. Then I used calculate_lat_lon_distance with those coordinates and the bridge's coordinates, resulting in 67.977 km.\n\nNow, the user might be expecting the distance again. But wait, in the previous response, I already gave them the distance as 68 km. Maybe they need a reminder or a more detailed explanation. Also, the user might be confused about how the distance is calculated or want to know the actual route. Should I mention that the straight-line distance is different from driving distance? Also, maybe they need help with directions or other modes of transport. Let me present the distance again and offer further assistance. Maybe also explain the difference between straight-line and actual travel distance. But since the tools only have calculate_lat_lon_distance, which is straight-line, I should stick to that. Also, check if there's any other function that can help with directions, but looking at the tools, there's no function for directions. So I should offer to help with other related things like weather, nearby locations, etc., based on available functions. Let me structure the response clearly, confirm their location, state the distance, and offer further help.\n</think>\n\nYour current coordinates are **37.3346° N, 122.0091° W** (Apple Park, Cupertino, CA). The straight-line (as the crow flies) distance to the Golden Gate Bridge (37.8199° N, 122.4786° W) is **~68 kilometers (42 miles)**. \n\nIf you need:\n- **Driving/walking distance** (requires external mapping tool, not in our current functions)\n- **Weather forecast** for your route\n- **Nearby points of interest** along the way\n\nLet me know!
