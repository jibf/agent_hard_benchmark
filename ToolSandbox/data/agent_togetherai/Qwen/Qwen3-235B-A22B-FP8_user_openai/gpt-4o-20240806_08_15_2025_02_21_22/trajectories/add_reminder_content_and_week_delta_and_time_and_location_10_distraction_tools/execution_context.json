                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the user's request. They want to be reminded to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the reminder part. The user mentioned a specific time and location. The functions available include add_reminder, which requires content, reminder_timestamp, and optionally latitude and longitude. \n\nThe time is tomorrow at 5 PM. To convert that into a POSIX timestamp, I should use the get_current_timestamp function first to get the current time, then calculate tomorrow's 5 PM. But wait, maybe there's a function to shift the timestamp by days. The shift_timestamp function can add a day. Let me check: get_current_timestamp gives the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day to get tomorrow's date. Then set the time to 5 PM. Hmm, but shifting by days might not adjust the time correctly. Alternatively, use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But how to get tomorrow's date components?\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, add one day (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's date, then adjust the time to 17:00 (5 PM). Wait, but that might not account for different time zones. However, the user might be in their current location, so maybe using shift_timestamp with days=1 and then setting the time. But the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So perhaps take the current timestamp, add 1 day and 5 hours (since 5 PM is 17:00, but current time might be different). Wait, no. If the current time is, say, 10 AM, adding 1 day and 7 hours would get to 5 PM the next day. But this approach might not be accurate because the current time's hour could vary. \n\nAlternatively, parse tomorrow's date (year, month, day) and set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. To get tomorrow's date, first get the current date using timestamp_to_datetime_info. For example, if today is 2023-10-25, tomorrow is 2023-10-26. Then use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2023, month=10, day=26, hour=17, minute=0, second=0. That would give the correct timestamp. But how to get tomorrow's date components? Need to get the current timestamp, convert to datetime info, increment the day by 1, then convert back. So first, call get_current_timestamp, then convert to datetime info, add a day, then create the new timestamp. But the functions available don't have a direct way to add days to a timestamp, so this approach would require multiple steps.\n\nSo first, get_current_timestamp. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get year, month, day, etc. Then add 1 day to the day, making sure to handle month and year transitions (like end of month). Then use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create the new timestamp for tomorrow at midnight, then add 17 hours. Wait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp: take the current timestamp, shift by days=1 to get the next day, then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how? The shift_timestamp function can shift by days, but setting the exact time might not be straightforward. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day would take it to 3 PM tomorrow. Then, to get to 5 PM, shift by 2 more hours. So total shift: days=1, hours=2. But the user wants 5 PM regardless of current time. So the correct approach would be to get tomorrow's date (current timestamp + 1 day), then set the time to 5 PM. But how to do that with the available functions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Let's say the current timestamp is obtained via get_current_timestamp. Convert that to datetime info. Add 1 day to the day, if day exceeds the month's days, adjust month and year accordingly. Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, and call datetime_info_to_timestamp. But since the functions don't handle date arithmetic, the user might need to use shift_timestamp for days and then adjust hours. For example, take current timestamp, shift by days=1 to get tomorrow's date same time, then shift by hours=(17 - current_hour) to reach 5 PM. But if current hour is 10, that's 7 hours added. However, this could lead to errors if the current hour is 18 (then adding -13 hours to get to 5 PM next day, but that might actually be the previous day). This seems error-prone. \n\nPerhaps the safest way is to use the get_current_timestamp, then shift by 1 day, then calculate the desired time. Wait, shifting by 1 day (86400 seconds) will take the current time to exactly 24 hours later. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, not 24 hours from now. For example, if it's 10 PM now, shifting by 1 day would take to 10 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So that approach would be 7 hours too early. Therefore, this method isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects \"tomorrow 5 PM\" to be the next occurrence of 5 PM, regardless of the current time. So, the correct approach would be to find tomorrow's date (year, month, day), set the time to 17:00:00, and convert that into a timestamp. To get tomorrow's date components, the assistant needs to get the current date, add one day, handle month/year transitions, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp. \n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add 1 day to the day. If the day exceeds the month's days, increment month and reset day to 1, etc. (But how to handle this without functions? Maybe the assistant can assume that adding 1 day to the day is sufficient, but in reality, this might require handling. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle invalid dates by normalizing them. For example, if day is 31 and month is April (30 days), passing day=31 might automatically roll over to May 1st. Wait, but the function's description doesn't specify that. So maybe the assistant should handle it, but without a function to get the number of days in a month, it's tricky. Therefore, perhaps the assistant can proceed with adding 1 day to the day, and assume that the datetime_info_to_timestamp function will handle the normalization.)\n\nAssuming that works, then:\n\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day+1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut wait, if the current day is the last day of the month, adding 1 day would roll over to the next month. The timestamp_to_datetime_info would return the correct values. So:\n\nAfter getting the current datetime info, increment the day by 1, then pass to datetime_info_to_timestamp. Wait, no. Because the current datetime info is for the current time, which includes the current day. Adding 1 day would give tomorrow's day, but the time would still be the current time. Wait, no. Because when you convert the current timestamp to datetime info, you get the current date and time. If you then create a new datetime info with day=current_day + 1, but keep the hour, minute, second same, then converting that to a timestamp would give tomorrow's time at the same hour. But the user wants 5 PM, so after adding 1 day to the current date, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T0)\n- Convert T0 to datetime info (D0)\n- Create D1 with D0's year, month, day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0\n- Convert D1 to timestamp (T1), which is tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut this requires that the day +1 is valid. If not, the function might handle it, but the assistant can't know. However, given the available functions, this is the correct approach.\n\nOnce the reminder timestamp is determined, the next part is the location: \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". To get the latitude and longitude for that address, the assistant can use the search_location_around_lat_lon function. However, that function requires a location query and optionally latitude and longitude (to search around). Since the user didn't specify a specific area, but wants the Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, the assistant might need to search for that location. However, without a current location, the function might default to a general search. Wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function's parameters have 'location' as required, and latitude/longitude as optional. So the assistant can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", without providing latitude and longitude, which would default to the current location. But since the assistant doesn't have the current location (unless the user has provided it before), but the function's default is to use the current latitude and longitude. However, the assistant can't obtain the current location without the user providing it. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon says: \"Defaults to",
