                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the timestamps for yesterday. Since the current date is October 25, 2023, yesterday would be October 24, 2023. But I should use the current timestamp to calculate it accurately.\n\nI should call get_current_timestamp to get the current POSIX timestamp. Then, subtract one day's worth of seconds to get yesterday's timestamp. Wait, but maybe using shift_timestamp would be better. Let me check the available functions.\n\nYes, there's a shift_timestamp function that can subtract a day. So first, get the current timestamp, then shift it by -1 days to get yesterday's timestamp. Then, I need to set the lower and upper bounds for the creation_timestamp. The lower bound would be the start of yesterday (midnight) and the upper bound would be the end of yesterday (11:59:59 PM). \n\nWait, but how to get the start and end of yesterday? Let me think. After getting yesterday's timestamp, maybe I need to convert it to datetime info to find the exact start and end. Alternatively, since the user wants reminders created on yesterday's date, regardless of the time, I can calculate the lowerbound as midnight of yesterday and upperbound as midnight of today. That way, any reminder created between those two timestamps would be considered as created yesterday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Shift it by -1 days to get a timestamp that's the same time yesterday.\n3. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe I need to convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info, set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp. But that might require multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Since the user wants reminders created on the previous day (from midnight to midnight), I can calculate the lowerbound as midnight of today minus 24 hours, and upperbound as midnight of today. Wait, that might not work if the current time isn't in the early morning. Let me think again.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose today is 2023-10-25 15:00:00. Yesterday would be 2023-10-24 00:00:00 to 2023-10-24 23:59:59. So the lowerbound is midnight of yesterday, upperbound is midnight of today minus one second. To get midnight of today, I can take the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, set time to 00:00:00, then convert back to timestamp. Then subtract one second to get upperbound. Lowerbound would be that midnight minus 24 hours.\n\nBut how to do that in the available functions. Hmm. Let me outline:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current_time.\n- Convert current_time to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n- Create a new datetime with the same year, month, day, but set hour, minute, second to 0. Then convert that to a timestamp (midnight_today).\n- Lowerbound = midnight_today - 86400 seconds (which is 24 hours)\n- Upperbound = midnight_today\n\nSo reminders created between lowerbound and upperbound would be those created yesterday.\n\nBut how to do this with the functions provided. Let's see:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info. Then, create a new datetime with hour, minute, second as 0. Then convert back to timestamp. But the function to convert back is datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but how do I get the datetime info? Let me see:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() → current_time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_time → gives year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n3. Modify the hour, minute, second to 0, keep year, month, day same. Then call datetime_info_to_timestamp to get midnight_today.\n4. Then subtract 86400 from midnight_today to get lowerbound (midnight yesterday).\n5. Upperbound is midnight_today.\n\nWait, but in the search_reminder function, there's creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound. So I need to set those two values to find reminders created between midnight yesterday and midnight today.\n\nBut since the user might have created reminders at any time yesterday, this approach would capture all of them.\n\nOnce those bounds are calculated, call search_reminder with those parameters. The other parameters like content, reminder_id, latitude, longitude are not specified, so they can be omitted.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info, zero out time to get midnight today.\n- Convert that back to timestamp (midnight_today).\n- Lowerbound = midnight_today - 86400 (midnight yesterday)\n- Upperbound = midnight_today\n\nThen use these lower and upper bounds in search_reminder.\n\nWait, but the function shift_timestamp can be used here. Alternatively, after getting midnight_today, subtract a day (86400 seconds) to get lowerbound. But since midnight_today is already the start of today, subtracting 86400 would get midnight yesterday.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp. Then convert to datetime info, adjust the time to midnight, convert back to timestamp, then set lower and upper bounds accordingly.\n\nBut how to do this step-by-step with the available functions.\n\nLet me outline each function call:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() → current_time.\n\nThen:\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_time to get current_dt.\n\nIn current_dt, we have year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n\n3. Create a new datetime info with hour=0, minute=0, second=0, same year, month, day.\n\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with this new datetime info → midnight_today.\n\n5. Calculate lowerbound = midnight_today - 86400 (since 86400 seconds in a day) → midnight_yesterday.\n\nUpperbound is midnight_today.\n\nThen use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound=lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound=upperbound.\n\nThis would find all reminders created on the previous day (yesterday).\n\nSo the tool calls needed would be:\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current_time.\n\nThen datetime_info_to_timestamp with the adjusted datetime.\n\nThen search_reminder with the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut since the user might not have created any reminders, the result might be empty, but that's okay.\n\nSo, the assistant needs to make these function calls step by step.\n\nBut in the response, the assistant needs to generate the tool calls in XML tags as per the instructions.\n\nSo, first tool call is get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, after getting the current time, proceed to convert to datetime info.\n\nBut since each step depends on the previous, the assistant must chain the calls.\n\nBut in the initial response, the assistant can only make the first tool call. However, according to the problem statement, the user's query is a single message, and the assistant must generate the necessary tool calls in sequence.\n\nWait, but the assistant is supposed to generate all the necessary tool calls in the response. But according to the instructions, each function call should be in a separate tool_call block. However, the assistant might need to chain the results. For example, the first function's output is needed for the next function.\n\nBut in the scenario, the assistant is supposed to generate the correct sequence of tool calls based on the available functions and the user's query.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_time.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_time to get current_dt.\n\n3. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with adjusted datetime (hour=0, min=0, sec=0) to get midnight_today.\n\n4. Calculate lowerbound as midnight_today - 86400 (which can be done by the assistant without a function call, since it's just subtracting a day's seconds).\n\nBut wait, the shift_timestamp function can also shift by days. Alternatively, since the assistant can do basic math, perhaps subtracting 86400 is acceptable.\n\nBut the assistant can use shift_timestamp to shift midnight_today by -1 day to get midnight yesterday. That might be more accurate.\n\nWait, if midnight_today is a timestamp, then midnight_yesterday = midnight_today - 86400. So perhaps that's straightforward.\n\nSo steps:\n\nAfter getting midnight_today, lowerbound = midnight_today - 86400.\n\nUpperbound = midnight_today.\n\nThen call search_reminder with those lower and upper bounds.\n\nSo putting it all together, the tool calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n\nThen, datetime_info_to_timestamp with the adjusted datetime (midnight).\n\nThen, calculate lowerbound as midnight_today - 86400.\n\nThen call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations outside the functions, but can it do that? For example, subtracting 86400 from midnight_today would be allowed since it's a simple arithmetic operation.\n\nSo the assistant can generate the tool calls accordingly.\n\nSo, the assistant would make the following calls:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp\n\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info with the result of 1.\n\n3. datetime_info_to_timestamp with the adjusted datetime (hour=0, minute=0, second=0)\n\n4.",
