Since the user didn't specify a time, maybe I should ask for clarification. Wait, but maybe I can use get_current_timestamp to get the current time and add a default reminder time? Wait, no, because the user might want to set a specific time. But the problem is, the user didn't specify when. So I should prompt them for when they want the reminder. Alternatively, maybe the system allows setting a reminder without a timestamp, but according to the function definition, reminder_timestamp is required. So I can't proceed without it. Therefore, I need to ask the user to specify the time for the reminder. Let me check the modify_reminder function too, but that requires a reminder_id, which I don't have yet. So the correct approach is to ask the user to provide the time when they want the reminder. Alternatively, if there's a way to set a default, but since the function requires it, I can't. So I should respond by asking for the time.\n</think>\n\nTo set a reminder to buy chocolate milk, please specify the date and time when you'd like to be reminded.

Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the date and time into a POSIX timestamp. The user mentioned \"tomorrow at 5 PM,\" so I need to determine the correct date. Since today's date isn't provided, I'll have to use the current date as a reference. But wait, the system might not have real-time data, so maybe I should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. That way, I can calculate tomorrow's date accurately.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify a date, just \"tomorrow.\" So I should get the current timestamp, add 24 hours to it, and then adjust the time to 5 PM. Let me check the available functions. There's get_current_timestamp, which gives the current time. Then, I can use datetime_info_to_timestamp to convert the adjusted date and time into a timestamp.\n\nBut hold on, maybe the user wants 5 PM in their local time zone. However, the functions don't mention time zones. I'll assume that the timestamp is in UTC. But the user might expect it in their local time. Hmm, but the function parameters don't include time zones, so perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that the timestamp is calculated based on the system's current time, which might be UTC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for tomorrow at 5 PM in their local time. Without knowing their time zone, converting to a timestamp would be tricky. However, the function requires a POSIX timestamp, which is in UTC. So perhaps the user's local time is being converted to UTC. But how to handle that without knowing the time zone? Maybe the system handles it automatically when using the functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's device automatically adjusts the timestamp based on their time zone. Since the function requires a POSIX timestamp, which is in UTC, I'll proceed under the assumption that adding 24 hours to the current timestamp and setting the time to 5 PM will suffice.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp is needed. Let me first call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info to find today's date. Then, add one day to the date and set the time to 17:00 (5 PM). Then convert that datetime info back to a timestamp.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime_info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. This gives year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and isoweekday.\n3. Increment the day by 1. If the current day is the last day of the month, handle month and year accordingly. Wait, but the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might already handle that when converting back. Alternatively, adding 24 hours to the current timestamp would automatically adjust the date, which might be simpler.\n\nWait, adding 24 hours to the current timestamp would give tomorrow's date at the same time. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of the current time. So if it's 6 PM today, adding 24 hours would be 6 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. Therefore, adding 24 hours and then adjusting the hour to 17 (5 PM) would be better.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Add 1 day to the date (or subtract 24 hours * 3600 seconds). Wait, but adding 24 hours might not always be accurate due to daylight saving changes, but perhaps the functions handle that. Alternatively, adjust the day in the datetime info.\n\nBut maybe the better approach is to take the current timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds), then adjust the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0. But how to handle cases where adding 24 hours might not be exactly a day? For example, during daylight saving time changes. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function would handle that correctly when converting back.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()\n\ntomorrow_timestamp = current_timestamp + 86400  # 24 hours in seconds\n\nThen convert tomorrow_timestamp to datetime info to get the date, then set the hour to 17, minute and second to 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but if I add 24 hours to the current timestamp, that gives the same time tomorrow. Then, if the user wants 5 PM, regardless of the current time, we need to adjust the hour and minute. So for example, if the current time is 3 PM, tomorrow_timestamp would be 3 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM, so we need to add 2 hours (7200 seconds) to tomorrow_timestamp. Alternatively, take the date of tomorrow_timestamp, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert that datetime info back to a timestamp.\n\nThis approach would ensure that the time is exactly 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of the current time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n\n2. Convert current_ts to datetime info (current_dt) to get today's date.\n\n3. Add one day to current_dt's date. Handle month/year transitions if necessary.\n\n4. Create a new datetime info with the new date, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n5. Convert this new datetime info to a timestamp (reminder_ts).\n\nBut how to add one day to the date? For example, if today is October 31, adding a day would be November 1. The timestamp_to_datetime_info function would handle that when converting back.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, add 86400 seconds to get tomorrow's timestamp, then convert that to datetime info, and set the hour, minute, second to 17, 0, 0.\n\nBut adding 86400 seconds might not always result in the next day (due to leap seconds or DST changes, though POSIX timestamps usually ignore leap seconds). However, converting that tomorrow_ts to datetime info would give the correct date, then we can adjust the time.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ntomorrow_ts = current_ts + 86400\n\ntomorrow_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(tomorrow_ts)\n\n# Now set the time to 17:00:00\nreminder_dt = {\n    'year': tomorrow_dt['year'],\n    'month': tomorrow_dt['month'],\n    'day': tomorrow_dt['day'],\n    'hour': 17,\n    'minute': 0,\n    'second': 0\n}\n\nreminder_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(**reminder_dt)\n\nWait, but what if the current timestamp is, say, 3 PM, then adding 86400 gives 3 PM tomorrow. But we need to set the time to 5 PM, so we need to add 2 hours (7200 seconds) to the tomorrow_ts. Alternatively, take the date from tomorrow_ts, set the hour to 17, and convert that date and time back to a timestamp.\n\nBut the correct way is to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, which will handle the conversion properly.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get the current time.\n\n2. Convert that to datetime info to get today's date components.\n\n3. Add one day to the date (could be done by converting to a date object and adding a day, but since we're using the functions, maybe adding 86400 seconds gives the next day's timestamp, but then adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\n# Convert to datetime info to get today's date\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\n# Create a new datetime info for tomorrow at the same time\n# Wait, no. User wants tomorrow at 5 PM, regardless of current time.\n\nSo:\n\n# Get current timestamp\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\n# Convert to datetime info\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\n# Create a new datetime info for tomorrow at 5 PM\n# So day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0\n# But need to handle month/year transitions\n\n# So first, create a datetime info with day +1\n# But how? The functions don't have a way to increment dates directly. So the correct approach is to add 86400 seconds to current_ts to get tomorrow's timestamp, then convert that to datetime info, which will give the correct date. Then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo:\n\ntomorrow_midnight_ts = current_ts + 86400  # 24 hours later\n\n# Convert to datetime info\ntomorrow_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(tomorrow_midnight_ts)\n\n# Now set the time to 17:00:00\nreminder_dt = {\n    'year': tomorrow_dt['year'],\n    'month': tomorrow_dt['month'],\n    'day': tomorrow_dt['day'],\n    'hour': 17,\n    'minute': 0,\n    'second': 0\n}\n\n# Convert this to timestamp\nreminder_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(**reminder_dt)\n\nWait, but this assumes that the date components are correct. For example, if current_ts is 11 PM on October 31, adding 86400 gives 11 PM on November 1. Then setting the hour to ",
