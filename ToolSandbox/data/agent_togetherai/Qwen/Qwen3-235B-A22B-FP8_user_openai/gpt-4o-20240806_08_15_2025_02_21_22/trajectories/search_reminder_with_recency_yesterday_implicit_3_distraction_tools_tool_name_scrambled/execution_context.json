                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So I need to figure out what they need. They probably want to see their reminders or tasks from yesterday. Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the reminder_3 function, which can search for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound, as well as reminder_timestamp ranges. Since the user is asking about yesterday, I need to determine the time frame for that day.\n\nBut wait, do they mean reminders created yesterday or reminders that were set to trigger yesterday? The question is a bit ambiguous. \"Todo\" usually refers to tasks they need to do, so maybe it's reminders set for yesterday. However, sometimes people might refer to their todo list from the previous day. I need to clarify, but since I can't ask, I'll have to make an assumption. \n\nAssuming they want reminders that were supposed to be reminded yesterday, I need to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday. To do that, I can use utilities_2 to get the current timestamp, then utilities_5 to shift it back by 24 hours to get the start of yesterday, and then set the upper bound as the start of today. Alternatively, using utilities_7 to convert the current timestamp to date parts, subtract a day, then convert back to timestamps for the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, the functions available include utilities_1 (convert datetime to POSIX), utilities_2 (get current timestamp), utilities_5 (shift timestamp), and utilities_7 (convert timestamp to datetime). So here's a plan:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp using utilities_2.\n2. Shift it back by 24 hours to get a timestamp for 24 hours ago. But maybe better to get the start of yesterday. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, yesterday is 2023-10-04. So, get current timestamp, convert to date parts (utilities_7), subtract one day from the 'day' field, then convert back to timestamp using utilities_1. Wait, but utilities_1 requires year, month, day, etc. So steps could be:\n\n- Use utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n- Use utilities_7 to convert current timestamp to date parts (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n- Subtract 1 day from the 'day' field. But need to handle month and year transitions. However, utilities_5 can handle shifting by days. Maybe better to use utilities_5 to subtract one day. Let me see: if I take the current timestamp and shift it back by 1 day, that gives a timestamp 24 hours ago. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), perhaps need to adjust hours, minutes, etc. But maybe the user considers yesterday as the entire day, so the reminder timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the start of today.\n\nAlternatively, using utilities_7 to get date parts for current time, subtract one day, then set hour, minute, second to 0 to get the start of yesterday. Then add 24 hours to get the end of yesterday. But how to handle that with the available functions?\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Convert to date parts (utilities_7).\n3. Subtract one day from the date parts. But how? For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday is 2023-10-04. So take the date parts (year, month, day) and subtract one day. But if day is 1, then subtract a month and set day to previous month's last day, etc. That's complicated. Instead, maybe use utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp by -1 day. That would give a timestamp exactly 24 hours ago. But then the range would be from that shifted timestamp to current timestamp. But that would cover the last 24 hours, which is yesterday's day. Wait, but if the current time is 3 PM, then 24 hours ago is yesterday 3 PM. So the range would be from yesterday 3 PM to today 3 PM. But the user might want all of yesterday, regardless of the current time. Hmm, this might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, to get the start of yesterday (midnight), shift the current timestamp back by 24 hours, then adjust to the start of that day. But how? Maybe using utilities_7 to get date parts of the current timestamp, subtract one day from the 'day' field, then use utilities_1 to create a timestamp with that day's midnight (00:00:00). Then the upper bound would be that day's 23:59:59. But handling that requires multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to calculate the lowerbound as midnight of yesterday and upperbound as 23:59:59 of yesterday. To do that:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Convert to date parts (utilities_7). Let's say current date is Y, M, D, H, Min, Sec.\n3. Subtract one day from D to get yesterday's date. If D is 1, then adjust month and year accordingly. However, maybe using utilities_5 to subtract 1 day from current timestamp gives us a timestamp that is 24 hours ago. Then convert that to date parts. For example:\n\na. current_ts = utilities_2()\nb. yesterday_ts = utilities_5(current_ts, days=-1)\nc. yesterday_parts = utilities_7(yesterday_ts)\nd. Then, set hour=0, minute=0, second=0 to get the start of yesterday\ne. Convert that to timestamp using utilities_1 as lowerbound\nf. Similarly, set hour=23, minute=59, second=59 for the end of yesterday, convert to timestamp as upperbound.\n\nWait, but how do I get the date parts of yesterday and then adjust them? Because if I take current_ts, subtract a day, then get the date parts, that would give yesterday's date. Then, to get the start of that day, I can use the date parts (year, month, day) with hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. current_ts = utilities_2() → get current timestamp.\n2. yesterday_parts = utilities_7(utilities_5(current_ts, days=-1)) → subtract one day and get date parts.\n   - This gives the date parts of 24 hours ago, which might be yesterday or not depending on the time. Wait, if current time is 2023-10-05 03:00:00, subtracting one day gives 2023-10-04 03:00:00. So the date parts would be Y=2023, M=10, D=4. So to get the start of yesterday, we can take that date's Y, M, D and set H, M, S to 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if we subtract a day, we get a timestamp that's 24 hours prior. But to get the start of yesterday's date (regardless of current time), we need to get the date of yesterday, then set the time to 00:00:00.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts)\n2. Convert to date parts (current_parts)\n3. Create a new date with day = current_parts.day -1, then set H:M:S to 00:00:00. But how to handle that with the available functions?\n\nAlternatively, here's a way:\n\n- Use utilities_7 on current_ts to get current date parts.\n- Subtract one day from the 'day' field. If the day is 1, then we need to go to previous month, which is complicated. But maybe using utilities_5 to subtract 1 day's worth of seconds. Wait, but the utilities_5 function can shift by days. For example, if current_ts is 2023-10-05 15:00:00, then utilities_5(current_ts, days=-1) would be 2023-10-04 15:00:00. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), perhaps:\n\n1. current_ts = utilities_2()\n2. current_parts = utilities_7(current_ts)\n3. yesterday_midnight_parts = copy of current_parts, day = current_parts.day -1, hour=0, minute=0, second=0\n   - But if current_parts.day is 1, then subtracting 1 day would go to previous month's last day. How to handle that? The utilities_1 function can handle converting that to a valid timestamp. For example, if current date is 2023-10-01, then subtracting 1 day would be 2023-09-30. So using utilities_1 with year, month, day adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2)\n2. Convert to date parts (utilities_7)\n3. Create a new date parts with day = day -1, and hour=0, minute=0, second=0 → this would be midnight of yesterday\n4. Convert that to lowerbound timestamp using utilities_1\n5. Create another date parts with day = day -1, hour=23, minute=5",
