So first, I need to figure out how to get the current temperature there. But looking at the available tools, there's no direct function for weather or temperature data. Hmm.\n\nWait, the tools provided include functions for location search, stock info, holiday conversion, and unit conversion. Maybe I can use the location search to get more details about the Grand Canyon. Let me check the functions again.\n\nThere's function 2, which allows searching for a location around a latitude and longitude. The user didn't provide coordinates, so it would default to the current location. But if I don't have the current coordinates, that might not help. Wait, maybe the function can take a location name like \"Grand Canyon\" as the query. Let me see the description again.\n\nFunction 2's parameters: location is a surface form query defining the location, like a business name, point of interest, city, etc. So \"Grand Canyon\" should work as the location. But the function doesn't mention retrieving weather data. It gives info like name, address, category, etc. So even if I use this function with location set to \"Grand Canyon\", it might not give the current temperature.\n\nThe user also mentioned they can't read Celsius, so they probably want Fahrenheit. But without a temperature value to convert, the unit conversion tool (function 8) can't be used yet. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant is supposed to know the current temperature through some external knowledge, but according to the instructions, I can only use the provided tools. Since none of the tools provide weather data, I can't retrieve the current temperature. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't access real-time weather data and suggest they check a weather service. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use the existing tools to get the temperature. Let me double-check. The functions available are for location search, stock info, holiday dates, and unit conversion. None of these will provide temperature data. So, the correct response is to explain that I can't access current temperature info with the available tools.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time weather data through the provided tools. You might want to check a dedicated weather service for current temperatures at the Grand Canyon. Would you like me to help with any other type of information from the tools available?"
