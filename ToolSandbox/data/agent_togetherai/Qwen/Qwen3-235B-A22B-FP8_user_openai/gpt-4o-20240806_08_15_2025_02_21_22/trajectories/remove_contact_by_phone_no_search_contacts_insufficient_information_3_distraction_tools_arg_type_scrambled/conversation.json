There's a remove_contact function that requires a person_id. But the user provided a phone number instead of a person ID. The functions don't have a way to search by phone number. So I can't directly remove the contact using the given functions. I should inform the user that I need the person ID to proceed. Maybe they can check their contacts list for the ID. Alternatively, if they don't have the ID, they might need to look it up first, but since the tools don't include a search function, that's not possible. So the correct step is to ask for the person ID associated with that phone number.\n</think>\n\nThe system requires the unique identifier (person_id) of the contact to remove an entry. Since the provided information only includes the phone number, I cannot directly remove the contact. Please provide the person_id associated with the phone number +12453344098 to proceed with deletion."

Maybe suggest they check if they can find the person_id through another method or contact support if they need help.
