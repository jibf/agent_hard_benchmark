Let me see which functions I can use here.\n\nFirst, the reminder_0 function is for adding a reminder. The required parameters are content and reminder_timestamp. They also have optional latitude and longitude. \n\nThe user didn't specify a time, so I need to ask for clarification on when they want the reminder. Without the timestamp, I can't proceed with the function call. \n\nAdditionally, maybe they want the reminder to be location-based. If they do, I might need to get the location of Whole Foods using the rapid_api_search_tools_2 function. But first, I should check if they have location services enabled. Wait, the setting_2 function can check location service status. But maybe that's too much. Alternatively, if the user hasn't provided latitude and longitude, I might need to get their current location using setting_1. However, the user hasn't mentioned anything about a specific location, so maybe just asking for the time is enough.\n\nWait, the reminder can have a timestamp and optionally a location. Since the user mentioned Whole Foods, maybe they want the reminder to trigger when they are near there. But to get the exact coordinates, I would need to use the search tool. But that might be beyond the scope here. The user's main request is to add the reminder, so the essential info is the content and timestamp. Since the timestamp is missing, I should prompt them to provide the time for the reminder. The location can be added later if needed, but the required parameters must be met first. So the first step is to ask for the reminder timestamp.\n</think>\n\nTo add your reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods, I need to know the specific time you'd like to be reminded. Could you please provide the time (e.g., \"at 3 PM\" or \"tomorrow at 10 AM\")? If you'd also like the reminder to be location-based (e.g., when you're near Whole Foods), let me know!",

Since the user specified tomorrow at 5 PM, I used the utilities_2 function to get the current timestamp, which was 1755246245.044481. Then, I calculated tomorrow's date by adding 24 hours (86400 seconds) to the current timestamp. However, since the user specified 5 PM, I had to adjust the time to the next day's 17:00. The current time was around 10:04 AM, so adding 7 hours (25200 seconds) would get to 5 PM the same day. But since the user said \"tomorrow,\" I added 24 hours plus the 7 hours, totaling 86400 + 25200 = 111600 seconds. Adding that to the current timestamp gives 1755246245.044481 + 111600 = 1755301200 (rounded to the nearest second). Then, I called the reminder_0 function with the content and the calculated timestamp. The response was a reminder ID, which I used to confirm the reminder was set. Since the user didn't specify a location, I didn't include latitude and longitude. The final response informs the user the reminder is set for tomorrow at 5 PM and offers to add a location if needed.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to \"Buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\" has been set for tomorrow at 5:00 PM. \n\nWould you like me to add a location-based trigger for this reminder (e.g., when you're near Whole Foods)? If so, I can search for Whole Foods locations near you.",

So the user hasn't enabled location services. To proceed with the location-based reminder, they need to enable location services first. \n\nI should prompt the user to enable location services so I can search for the specific Whole Foods location. Once that's done, I can get the latitude and longitude of the store and update the reminder with those coordinates. \n\nBut wait, the user might not know how to enable location services. I should mention that they need to go to the app settings or device settings to enable it. Also, after enabling, I can proceed to get the location details and update the reminder. \n\nI need to make sure the user understands why enabling location services is necessary here. Explaining that it's required for the app to access their location and set the reminder based on proximity to the store would help. \n\nSo the next step is to ask the user to enable location services and then proceed with the search once it's enabled. That way, the reminder can be properly set with the location trigger.\n</think>\n\nTo set a location-based reminder for Whole Foods on McKinley Ave, I need to enable location services first.

Earlier attempts showed that location services aren't enabled. The error when trying to enable location services was a TypeError because the function setting_2 was called with 'on': true, but the function doesn't accept parameters.\n\nWait, looking back at the tools provided, setting_2's description is \"Request location service status\" with no parameters. So, to enable location services, maybe there's another function? Wait, checking the tools again. There's setting_2 which just requests the status, and maybe another function to enable it. Wait, no, looking at the list: setting_0 is cellular status, setting_1 is current location, setting_2 is location service status, setting_7 is enable/disable low battery, setting_8 is enable/disable wifi. Wait, there's no function listed that enables location services. Oh, that's a problem. The user tried to use setting_2 with 'on' parameter, but according to the tool definition, setting_2 has no parameters. So the error occurred because the function doesn't accept 'on' as a parameter.\n\nSo, the assistant needs to inform the user that enabling location services isn't possible through the available functions. Therefore, the reminder can't be set with a location trigger. The user might need to manually enable location services via their device settings. Then, the assistant can proceed to set the reminder without the location, or maybe suggest the user check the location manually. So, the next step is to inform the user that enabling location services isn't possible through the current tools and proceed without it, or ask if they want to continue without the location.\n</think>\n\nIt seems I can't directly enable location services through the available tools. You'll need to enable location access manually in your device settings. Once enabled, I can then retrieve your current location to set the reminder trigger for Whole Foods on McKinley Ave.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with setting the reminder without the location trigger for now? The reminder will still activate at tomorrow at 5:00 PM.",
