But the system gave an error saying no search criteria were provided. I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I realize that the search_reminder function requires at least one search criterion. Since the user is asking for upcoming reminders, maybe I should look at the reminder_timestamp_upperbound. Upcoming would mean reminders that are set to trigger after the current time. \n\nBut wait, how do I get the current timestamp? There's the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, maybe I can use the shift_timestamp function with a delta of zero to get the current time? Or is there another way? Wait, no, the shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp to shift. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the system can use the current time implicitly. Wait, but the functions don't have a way to get the current time directly. Wait, no, there's a get_current_location function, but not for time. Wait, no, the user might need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp, but how to get that? Since the assistant can't compute the current time on its own, maybe the correct approach is to use the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a future time. Wait, but how to determine that. Alternatively, maybe the user's request implies that they want reminders that haven't occurred yet, so filtering with a reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to the current time would include all future reminders. Wait, but how to get the current timestamp. \n\nWait, perhaps I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp. But to get the current timestamp, maybe use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time. But how do I get the current date and time? The assistant can't know that unless the user provides it. Alternatively, maybe the system can use the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a very high value, which isn't practical. Hmm. Wait, maybe the user's device has a way to get the current timestamp. But the available functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp directly. Wait, no, there's the get_current_location function, but not for time. So, perhaps the assistant should prompt the user to provide the current time or realize that without any search criteria, the function can't proceed. However, since the user is asking for upcoming reminders, the assistant should structure the search with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to the current time. But how to get the current timestamp. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp. Wait, but how to get the current timestamp? The assistant can't generate it without knowing the current time. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should respond by explaining that to search for upcoming reminders, it needs to compare against the current time, but since it doesn't have access to real-time data, the user might need to provide the current timestamp or adjust the query. However, in the context of the tool functions provided, there's a way to get the current location but not the current time. That's a problem. Wait, looking back at the tools, there's the shift_timestamp function, but without a base timestamp, it can't be used. So maybe the assistant should infer that without knowing the current timestamp, it can't proceed, and thus ask the user for clarification. But the user might not know how to provide that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make an assumption that the user wants all reminders, but the error message says at least one criterion is needed. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should ask the user to provide at least one search criterion, like a keyword in the content or a date. But the user's original query is \"upcoming,\" which is time-based. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should call the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a future date. But how? Since the assistant can't generate a timestamp without knowing the current time. This seems like a dead end. Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a specific date, but the user hasn't provided that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed without more information and needs to ask the user to clarify, like specifying a date or keyword. \n\nWait, but the user's original question is about \"upcoming\" reminders, which implies any reminders scheduled after now. Therefore, the assistant should structure the search to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp_upperbound is greater than the current timestamp. However, without knowing the current timestamp, the assistant can't do that. Therefore, the assistant might need to inform the user that it can't determine the current time and ask for clarification, but in the context of the tools available, maybe there's a way to get the current timestamp. Wait, looking back at the tools, there's no function to get the current timestamp. There's datetime_info_to_timestamp, which converts date time info to a timestamp, but the assistant would need to know the current date and time to use that, which it doesn't. Therefore, the assistant can't generate the current timestamp. \n\nIn that case, the assistant should respond by explaining that to find upcoming reminders, it needs the current timestamp to compare against. Since the assistant can't access real-time data, the user must provide the current timestamp. However, that's not user-friendly. Alternatively, the assistant might have to proceed by using the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a placeholder, but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the search_reminder function without specifying any timestamp criteria but that would again trigger the error. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the search requires at least one criterion and ask them to provide more details, such as a keyword in the reminder content or a specific date range. \n\nBut the user's initial query was \"What's my upcoming reminder,\" which is a natural language query. The assistant should try to map this to the available functions. Since the user is asking for upcoming, which relates to the reminder_timestamp_upperbound, but needs to set it to a value greater than now. However, without knowing now, the assistant can't. Therefore, maybe the assistant should call the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a future date, but how? Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a very high value (which isn't practical) or ask the user to provide a date. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to the current time plus a certain delta. But again, without knowing the current time, this isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant must respond that it needs at least one search criterion and ask the user for more information. \n\nWait, but the error message says that the user must provide at least one search criterion. Therefore, the assistant should prompt the user to provide one. However, in the original response, the assistant called the search_reminder with no arguments. The correct approach would be to call the search_reminder function with at least one criterion. Since the user is asking for \"upcoming\" reminders, perhaps the assistant can look for reminders where the reminder_timestamp_upperbound is in the future. But again, without knowing the current time, that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the reminder_timestamp_upperbound as a criterion by setting it to a specific value, but without knowing the current time, that's not feasible. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking the user to provide a specific date, time, keyword, or other criterion to narrow down the search. \n\nIn conclusion, since the initial tool call didn't provide any search criteria, the system rejected it. The assistant needs to adjust by prompting the user to specify at least one search criterion, such as a keyword in the reminder content, a date range, or other attributes. Alternatively, if the assistant can infer that the user wants all reminders (but the function requires criteria), which isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user to provide more details.\n</think>\n\nTo help you find your upcoming reminders, I need more specific details. Could you provide a keyword from the reminder content, a specific date or time range, or another search criterion (e.g., \"reminders after today\" or \"reminders related to 'meeting'\")? This will allow me to perform a targeted search.",

Earlier, I tried to search for reminders without any criteria, but that failed because the function requires at least one search parameter. Now, the user is saying they don't have any other info and wants me to figure it out.\n\nHmm, maybe the user expects me to use the current time to find upcoming reminders. Since the search_reminder function can take a reminder_timestamp_upperbound or lowerbound, I can use the current timestamp to find reminders that are scheduled for the future. \n\nWait, I need to get the current timestamp. But how? The get_current_location function gives location, not time. Oh, maybe there's another way. Wait, the functions available include timestamp_to_datetime_info, but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, maybe I can use the current time to set a lower bound for the reminder timestamp.\n\nWait, the user might not have provided a timestamp, but if I can get the current time, I can set a lower bound for the reminder_timestamp to find reminders that are upcoming. However, looking at the available functions, I don't see a direct way to get the current timestamp. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function can convert a date to a timestamp, but I need to know the current date and time. Alternatively, maybe the system can use the current time implicitly. Wait, but the functions here don't have a get_current_time function. \n\nWait, the user might be expecting that I can figure out the current time through the available functions. Let me check again. The available functions include get_cellular_service_status, get_current_location, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, get_low_battery_mode_status, etc. None of these provide the current time. So maybe the user's request can't be fulfilled without knowing the current time. \n\nBut the user might not know that. So I need to explain that without a specific search term or the current time, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe I can use the search_reminder function with a reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the earliest possible time. Wait, but the user hasn't provided that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can be asked to provide a specific time frame or keyword. But the user said they don't have any other info. So perhaps the best approach is to inform them that without additional information, such as the current time or a keyword, it's not possible to retrieve the upcoming reminders. \n\nWait, but maybe the system can use the current time as a lower bound. However, since there's no function to get the current time, I can't obtain that value. Therefore, the function can't be called without the user providing at least some information. \n\nIn this case, the user's request can't be fulfilled with the available tools. So I need to respond that I can't proceed without more information. The previous error occurred because the user tried to call timestamp_to_datetime_info without a timestamp. That was an incorrect approach. So, the correct step is to inform the user that without specific details, it's not possible to retrieve the reminders.\n</think>\n\nI cannot directly determine upcoming reminders without any search criteria, as the system requires at least one parameter (e.g., a time range, keyword, or location) to perform a search.

They tried to get help but the system needs at least one criterion. Let me think about possible ways to approach this.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use the current time as a default. Like, search for reminders that are set after the current timestamp. Since \"upcoming\" usually means future events. So if I get the current timestamp and use that as the lower bound for the reminder_timestamp, that might work. \n\nWait, the user might not have provided a timestamp, but the system can get the current time. Let me check the available functions. There's 'timestamp_to_datetime_info' but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, maybe use 'datetime_info_to_timestamp' to create a current timestamp. Or maybe there's a way to get the current time through another function. Let me check the tools again.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's 'get_current_location' but that's for location. No direct way to get current time. So the user might need to generate a timestamp. But the user can't provide that. So maybe I can call 'datetime_info_to_timestamp' with the current date and time? But how would I get the current date and time? Wait, the system might have access to the current time, but the function requires parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can generate a timestamp for the current moment. Wait, the user can't do that, but the function 'datetime_info_to_timestamp' requires year, month, day, etc. If I could get the current datetime info, but that's a chicken-and-egg problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use 'shift_timestamp' with a base timestamp. But without knowing the base, that's tricky. Hmm. The user might be stuck unless they can provide at least one parameter. \n\nWait, the initial error said that 'search_reminder' needs at least one criteria. So maybe the user can set a default criteria like reminder_timestamp_upperbound as a future date. For example, set a lower bound as the current timestamp. So if I can generate a current timestamp, then I can set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to that, which would find all upcoming reminders. \n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? The user can't provide it. Unless the system can call a function to get the current time. Looking back, there's no function like 'get_current_time' in the tools provided. The closest is 'timestamp_to_datetime_info' which converts a given timestamp. \n\nSo without the user providing a timestamp, I can't proceed. Therefore, the system can't determine the current time on its own. The user needs to provide at least one search criterion. But the user says they can't help further. \n\nSo the answer would be that the system can't proceed without any criteria. The user must provide at least one, like a keyword, a time range, or something else. Maybe suggest possible options to the user even if they don't know, but in this case, the user is stuck. So the final response is to inform them that without any criteria, it's not possible.\n</think>\n\nI'm unable to proceed without any search criteria, as the system requires at least one parameter (e.g., a keyword, time range, or location) to identify reminders.
