                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are available. The user mentioned \"reminder,\" so I should check the reminder-related functions. There's search_reminder, modify_reminder, remove_reminder, etc. Since they want to push the reminder, modifying it makes sense.\n\nBut to modify a reminder, I need its reminder_id. The user didn't provide that, so I need to find it. How? By searching for upcoming reminders. The search_reminder function can help. But what criteria? Maybe look for reminders with a reminder_timestamp in the near future. But without knowing the exact time or content, it's tricky. However, the user says \"upcoming,\" which might mean the next one.\n\nOnce I find the reminder, I can get its ID and then modify the reminder_timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM. But how to calculate tomorrow's timestamp? Let's see. Current time is needed, but since there's no function to get current time, maybe the system can handle shifting the timestamp. Wait, there's a function called shift_timestamp. If I can get the current timestamp, but how? Alternatively, if the user's device can handle that. Wait, there's get_current_location, but not time. Hmm, maybe the system can handle relative shifts without knowing the exact current time.\n\nWait, the user says \"tomorrow 5PM.\" So regardless of the current time, the reminder should be set to tomorrow at 17:00. To calculate that timestamp, I might need to know the current date, shift it by one day, then set the time to 17:00. But without knowing the current date, how can I do that? Maybe using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But that requires knowing the year, month, day, etc. Alternatively, if the system can handle shifting the current time.\n\nWait, maybe the user's device can handle getting the current timestamp. But looking at the tools provided, there's no function to get the current timestamp. The closest is get_current_location, but that's for coordinates. So maybe the shift_timestamp function can be used with the current timestamp as a parameter. But how to get that? If the user's system can provide the current timestamp automatically, but the functions here don't include a way to get it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's reminder is already scheduled for today, and pushing it to tomorrow would involve adding 24 hours to its current reminder_timestamp. So first, search for the reminder (maybe the upcoming one), get its reminder_timestamp, add 24 hours to it, then modify the reminder with the new timestamp.\n\nBut how to find the reminder? The user says \"my upcoming reminder,\" which might be the next one in the list. So I need to call search_reminder with some criteria. Since the user didn't specify content or other details, maybe search_reminder without any parameters would return all reminders, and we can pick the one that's closest in time.\n\nBut the search_reminder function allows parameters like reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. If I want the upcoming ones, maybe set lowerbound to the current timestamp. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, this is tricky. Maybe the system can handle this internally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has only one upcoming reminder, so we can retrieve it by searching without parameters. Then, take the first result, get its reminder_id and current reminder_timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds), then modify the reminder with the new timestamp.\n\nPutting this together: first, call search_reminder to get all reminders, then find the one with the earliest reminder_timestamp. Then, add 24 hours to that timestamp and modify the reminder.\n\nBut how to implement this step-by-step with the available functions. Let's outline:\n\n1. Use search_reminder to get all reminders. Since no parameters are given, it might return all. Alternatively, maybe filter by reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. But without knowing current time, can't set lowerbound. So proceed with all.\n\n2. From the search results, identify the upcoming reminder (maybe the first one, or the one closest to now). This might require knowing the current timestamp, which we don't have. This is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the user's device or the system can handle getting the current timestamp, but it's not a function available here. Hmm. The available functions don't include a way to get the current time. So this complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: The user wants to push the reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. So regardless of when it's currently scheduled, set the reminder to tomorrow at 17:00. So we need to calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, we need to know the current date, add one day, set the time to 17:00. Without knowing the current date, how can we do that? Maybe using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But to use that, we need to know year, month, day, etc. But how to get that? There's the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, which converts a timestamp to date info, but again, we need a timestamp to start with.\n\nWait, but if the system can get the current timestamp (even though there's no function for it), then we can process it. Alternatively, perhaps the shift_timestamp function can be used with the current timestamp as an implicit parameter. For example, if we can shift the current timestamp by +1 day and set the time to 17:00.\n\nBut given the available functions, perhaps the best approach is to use the shift_timestamp function with the current timestamp. But how to get the current timestamp? The functions don't include a way to get it. This is a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the tools, there's a function called shift_timestamp which takes a timestamp as input and shifts it. So, if we can get the current timestamp, but since there's no function for that, maybe the system can handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user's device can provide it. But given the available functions, we can't get the current timestamp. This is a limitation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's reminder has a creation_timestamp, but modifying the reminder_timestamp to tomorrow's date requires knowing the specific date. Without knowing the current date, we can't compute tomorrow's date.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Wait, but maybe the user's device can handle relative shifts. For example, if the reminder is set for today, adding 24 hours would push it to tomorrow. So regardless of the current date, adding 24 hours (86400 seconds) to the current reminder_timestamp would work.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Search for the upcoming reminder. Since the user says \"my upcoming reminder,\" we need to find the next reminder. But how? Without knowing the current time, we can't set a lower bound. So perhaps the search_reminder function can be called without parameters, returning all reminders. Then, among them, the one with the earliest reminder_timestamp is the upcoming one.\n\n2. Once we have that reminder, get its reminder_id and current reminder_timestamp.\n\n3. Shift that timestamp by +1 day (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's same time, but the user wants 5 PM. Wait, no. The user says \"push to tomorrow 5 PM\" regardless of the original time. So it's not a shift by 24 hours, but setting the time to 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nThis complicates things. For example, if today is Monday and the reminder is on Monday at 3 PM, pushing to Tuesday at 5 PM. So the new time is tomorrow at 17:00, not the same time plus 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to set the reminder_timestamp to tomorrow at 17:00, regardless of the original time.\n\nTo calculate that timestamp, we need to determine tomorrow's date and set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, how can we do that? Let's see:\n\nIf we could get the current timestamp (but we can't), then add 24 hours to it, then convert that to a datetime_info, and then set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0. Then convert back to a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, if we can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with tomorrow's date and 17:00.\n\nBut again, how to get tomorrow's date without knowing today's date.\n\nThis seems impossible with the given functions unless there's a way to get the current date or timestamp.\n\nWait, there's a function called search_holiday which can take a year, but that's not helpful here. The other functions like get_current_location don't help with time.\n\nSo the problem here is that the available functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp or date. Therefore, the assistant can't calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a POSIX timestamp.\n\nThis is a limitation. Therefore, maybe the user's request can't be fulfilled with the given tools. But perhaps the assistant can make an assumption or use a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the user's device or the system has access to the current time, even though there's no function listed. But according to the provided tools, there's no way to get the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant can't compute tomorrow's 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp of 0, but that would be incorrect. Or maybe the assistant can use the current timestamp implicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's reminder already has a reminder_timestamp, and the assistant can shift it",
