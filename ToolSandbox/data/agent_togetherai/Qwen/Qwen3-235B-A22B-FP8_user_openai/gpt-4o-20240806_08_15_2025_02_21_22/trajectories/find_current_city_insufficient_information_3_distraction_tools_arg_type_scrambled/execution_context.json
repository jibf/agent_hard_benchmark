The search_lat_lon function specifically requires latitude and longitude to find an address. Since the user doesn't have those, I can't use that tool directly.\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Do I have access to any other information that could help determine their location? The user didn't mention any other details like IP address, city names, or other location-based data. The available functions don't include IP geolocation or any other methods to get location from other inputs. \n\nThe other tool is search_stock, but that's for stock information. It doesn't relate to location. So, with the given tools, there's no way to determine the user's city without the latitude and longitude. I need to inform them that I can't figure it out with the current tools and maybe suggest how they can obtain their coordinates, like using a maps app or a website that shows location data. \n\nI should make sure not to make up any information or assume values. Since the user can't provide the required parameters for the available functions, I can't proceed further. Let me check the tools again to confirm. Yep, search_lat_lon needs lat and lon. No other options. So the answer is that it's not possible with the current tools and information provided.\n</think>\n\nI currently don't have access to your location data (like GPS or IP geolocation).
