                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to set that up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact timestamp for next Friday's 5 PM. But wait, what's the current date? Since I don't have real-time data, I should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current POSIX timestamp. Once I have that, I can calculate next Friday's date.\n\nWait, but how to find next Friday? Let's see. The current day of the week can be found by converting the current timestamp to datetime info. So first, get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to get the current day of the week. Then, calculate the number of days needed to reach next Friday.\n\nFor example, if today is Wednesday, next Friday is two days away. If today is Friday, then next Friday would be seven days later. Hmm, but the user said \"next Friday,\" which typically means the upcoming Friday, even if today is Friday. Wait, actually, sometimes \"next Friday\" can be ambiguous. If today is Friday, does the user mean this Friday (in 24 hours) or the following Friday? Probably, they mean the upcoming Friday that's not today. So I need to check the current day.\n\nLet me break it down step by step:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get the current timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info to find the current day of the week (isoweekday).\n3. Determine how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Monday (isoweekday 1), then Friday is 4 days away. If today is Friday (isoweekday 5), then next Friday is 7 days later.\n4. Once I have the days delta, use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp to add the days and set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but the time needs to be 5 PM on that Friday. So the shift would include days and hours. For example, if today is Wednesday, and next Friday is two days away, then shift by 2 days and 17 hours (since 5 PM is 17:00 in 24-hour time). Wait, no. Wait, the current timestamp is the current date and time. To get to next Friday at 5 PM, I need to calculate the difference between the current time and the desired time.\n\nAlternatively, after determining the number of days to add, set the time to 17:00 (5 PM) on that day. But how to handle the time part. Because the current timestamp has a time component. So maybe after calculating the correct date, set the hours, minutes, and seconds to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to do that with the available functions. The shift_timestamp function allows shifting by weeks, days, hours, etc. So perhaps:\n\n- Calculate the number of days needed to reach next Friday from today.\n- Shift the current timestamp by that number of days.\n- Then, adjust the time to 17:00:00. But how? Because shift_timestamp can take hours, minutes, etc. Wait, if the current time is, say, 3 PM, then shifting by days would keep the same time. So to set it to 5 PM, we might need to adjust the hours. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, and we want to set it to 5 PM, that's a +2 hour shift. But if the current time is 6 PM, then we need to subtract 23 hours and add one day? Wait, no. Maybe it's easier to calculate the desired date and time by first adding the necessary days to reach Friday, then setting the time to 17:00.\n\nBut the functions available don't allow setting the time directly. So perhaps:\n\nAfter getting the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info. Then, calculate the days needed to reach next Friday. Then, shift the timestamp by that number of days, which gives us the correct date but same time. Then, check the current hour and adjust the hours and minutes to 17:00. So for example, if the current time is 10 AM, we need to add 7 hours. If the current time is 6 PM, we need to subtract 23 hours (which would go back to previous day's 7 PM?) but that might not be correct. Wait, but since we are already on the correct date (after shifting days), maybe we can just set the time to 5 PM regardless of current time. How?\n\nAlternatively, when creating the shifted timestamp, after adding the days, add (17 - current hour) hours, and adjust minutes and seconds accordingly. But that could be complex. However, the user didn't specify the time zone, so assuming the system's time zone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used to create a timestamp for the desired date and time. For example:\n\nOnce we have the date of next Friday (year, month, day), we can use datetime_info_to_timestamp with that date and set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (t0).\n2. Convert t0 to datetime info (current_year, current_month, current_day, current_hour, current_minute, current_second, current_isoweekday).\n3. Calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. For example:\n   - current_isoweekday is 1 (Monday): add 4 days (Friday is 5th day, 5-1=4)\n   - current_isoweekday is 5 (Friday): add 7 days (next Friday)\n   - current_isoweekday is 6 (Saturday): add 6 days (next Friday is 6 days later)\n   So the formula is: days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. Wait, let me test this:\n\nFor current_isoweekday = 1 (Mon), 5-1=4, mod 7 is 4 → correct.\ncurrent_isoweekday = 2 (Tue): 5-2=3 → 3\ncurrent_isoweekday = 3 (Wed): 5-3=2 → 2\ncurrent_isoweekday =4 (Thu): 5-4=1 → 1\ncurrent_isoweekday=5 (Fri): 5-5=0 → 0 +7? Wait, no. Wait, (5 - current_isoweekday +7) %7 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be (5 - current_isoweekday) if it's positive, else add 7. So days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) %7.\n\nWait for current_isoweekday=5: (5-5 +7) mod7 = 7 mod7=0. Which would mean adding 0 days. But that's the same day. So if the user says \"next Friday\" on Friday, they probably mean the next Friday, which is a week later. So the formula should be days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday +7) %7. But if current_isoweekday is 5 (Friday), (5-5)=0, so days_to_add is 0. That would be same day. So perhaps we need to add 7 days if the current day is Friday. Hmm. So maybe the formula should be:\n\nIf current_isoweekday ==5 (Friday), then days_to_add=7. Else, days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday) if positive, else (5 - current_isoweekday +7). Wait, perhaps another approach:\n\nWe can calculate the days_to_add as follows:\n\ndays_ahead = 5 - current_isoweekday\nif days_ahead <=0:\n    days_ahead +=7\n\nThis way, if today is Friday (days_ahead=0), then add 7 days. If today is Saturday (days_ahead=5-6= -1, so add 7-1=6 days). For example:\n\nMonday: days_ahead=4 → add 4 days.\nTuesday: 3 → add 3 days.\nWednesday: 2 → add 2 days.\nThursday:1 → add 1 day.\nFriday:0 → add 7 days.\nSaturday: -1 → add 6 days.\nSunday: -2 → add 5 days.\n\nYes, this would ensure that \"next Friday\" is always the next Friday after today, even if today is Friday.\n\nSo using this logic, days_to_add = days_ahead.\n\nOnce days_to_add is determined, then we can create a new date by adding days_to_add to the current date. Then, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nTo set the time, we can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. For example, once we have the year, month, day of next Friday, we can call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut how to get the year, month, day of next Friday?\n\nWe can use the current timestamp, shift it by days_to_add days, then convert that timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (t0).\n2. Convert t0 to datetime info (dt0) to get current_isoweekday, current_year, current_month, current_day, etc.\n3. Calculate days_to_add using days_ahead = 5 - current_isowe",
