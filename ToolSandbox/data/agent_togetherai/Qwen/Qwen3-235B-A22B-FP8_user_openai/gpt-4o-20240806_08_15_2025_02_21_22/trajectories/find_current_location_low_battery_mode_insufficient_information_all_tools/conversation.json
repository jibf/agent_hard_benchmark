Then I tried to turn it on, but there was a permission error because low battery mode was active. So I turned off low battery mode, but even then, the location service remained off. Now, I need to consider why the location service isn't turning on. Maybe there's another setting or permission issue. Alternatively, maybe the device doesn't have a GPS module, or the user hasn't granted location permissions to the app. Since the previous attempts failed, I should inform the user that I can't access their location and suggest checking permissions or enabling location services in the settings. I should also mention that low battery mode might interfere with certain features. Let me check if there's a way to prompt the user to manually enable location services through their device settings.\n</think>\n\nI cannot access your current location because location services are disabled. To enable location services, please check your device settings and ensure that both \"Location Service\" and \"Low Battery Mode\" are properly configured. Low Battery Mode may restrict background services like location tracking."
