I'll explain that and ask if they want to proceed with enabling Wi-Fi or try another method.\n</think>\n\nThe search for Christmas Day's date requires internet access, but your Wi-Fi is currently disabled.

Let me think.\n\nFirst, the previous interaction: the user asked \"Christmas Day when?\" and I tried to call the search_holiday function, but there was a connection error because Wi-Fi was off. Now the user is clarifying that they don't know the day.\n\nHmm, Christmas is always on December 25th. But maybe they want to know the weekday it falls on in a specific year. Since the user didn't specify a year, maybe they need the general date. However, the search_holiday function requires internet to get the exact date, especially if it's for the current or a specific year. \n\nWait, but if the user doesn't have Wi-Fi, I can't use the function. However, I can provide the general knowledge that Christmas is on December 25th every year. But the user might need the weekday, which varies. Without internet, I can't fetch the exact weekday for the current year. \n\nSo, the response should inform them that Christmas is December 25th, but to know the specific weekday, they might need to enable Wi-Fi. Alternatively, I can explain that without internet, I can't provide the exact day but can state the date. \n\nWait, maybe the user is asking for the current year's date. Since the search_holiday function defaults to the current year if not provided. But without internet, the function can't run. So, the answer should state that Christmas is on December 25th, and if they need the weekday, they can check another source or enable Wi-Fi. \n\nI should make sure to answer the question as much as possible without the function. Since the function is unavailable, use common knowledge. But maybe the user expects the date, so the answer is December 25th. However, the user mentioned \"what day it falls on,\" which could mean the date or the weekday. Clarify if needed, but based on prior, they might need the date. \n\nWait, the initial question was \"Christmas Day when?\" which is likely asking for the date. So the answer is December 25th. However, the user's follow-up says they're not sure what day, so maybe they need the weekday. But without internet, I can't get that. So explain that Christmas is December 25th, and the weekday varies. Suggest checking a calendar or enabling Wi-Fi for the current year's info.\n</think>\n\nChristmas Day is always celebrated on **December 25th** of each year. However, the specific weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) it falls on changes annually. For example, in 2023, Christmas was on a Monday, and in 2024, it will be on a Wednesday. \n\nIf you'd like to know the exact weekday for a specific year, I can look that up for you—just let me know the year! (Note: This requires internet access, so enabling Wi-Fi would help.)"

Then the user said they weren't sure what day it falls on, so I explained that it's always December 25th, varying by weekday. Now the user is stating the date again.\n\nThey might be confirming the date or perhaps want more info. Since they already have the date, maybe they need the weekday for a specific year. But the user hasn't asked for that yet. I should acknowledge their statement and offer further help. Let me make sure to keep the response friendly and open-ended in case they have more questions. Also, remember the Wi-Fi issue earlier; if they ask for more details requiring internet, I might need to remind them about enabling Wi-Fi again.\n</think>\n\nYes, Christmas Day is always observed on **December 25th** worldwide. If you'd like to know the specific weekday (e.g., Tuesday, Thursday) it falls on in a particular year, let me know the year, and I can check that for you!

They replied again confirming the date. \n\nThey might be done, but perhaps they want to know the weekday for this year or another. Since the previous attempt failed due to Wi-Fi, I should offer to check again if they enable Wi-Fi. But the user's last message is just a confirmation. Maybe they don't need anything else. \n\nI should acknowledge their confirmation and leave the door open in case they have more questions. Keep it friendly and concise. No need for another tool call since they didn't ask for more data. Just a polite response.\n</think>\n\nYou're all set! If you ever need to confirm the weekday for a specific year (e.g., \"Is Christmas on a weekend this year?\"), feel free to ask. Just note that checking specific weekdays for holidays requires internet access to fetch real-time data. 😊"
