I should let them know that Wi-Fi needs to be enabled for this query. Also, maybe suggest turning on Wi-Fi or checking the connection. Wait, the error message already says Wi-Fi is not enabled. So I need to inform the user that without Wi-Fi, the holiday info can't be retrieved. Maybe ask if they want to enable Wi-Fi? Or just state the requirement. The tools have set_wifi_status function. Should I offer to enable Wi-Fi? The user might need assistance with that. But the original query is about Christmas Day, so the main point is that the information can't be fetched without internet. I'll explain that and ask if they want to proceed with enabling Wi-Fi or try another method.\n</think>\n\nThe search for Christmas Day's date requires internet access, but your Wi-Fi is currently disabled.

Let me think.\n\nFirst, the previous interaction: the user asked \"Christmas Day when?\" and I tried to call the search_holiday function, but there was a connection error because Wi-Fi was off. Now the user is clarifying that they don't know the day.\n\nHmm, Christmas is always on December 25th. But maybe they want to know the weekday it falls on in a specific year. Since the user didn't specify a year, maybe they need the general date. However, the search_holiday function requires internet to get the exact date, especially if it's for the current or a specific year. \n\nWait, but if the user doesn't have Wi-Fi, I can't use the function. However, I can provide the general knowledge that Christmas is on December 25th every year. But the user might need the weekday, which varies. Without internet, I can't fetch the exact weekday for the current year. \n\nSo, the response should inform them that Christmas is December 25th, but to know the specific weekday, they might need to enable Wi-Fi. Alternatively, I can explain that without internet, I can't provide the exact day but can state the date. \n\nWait, maybe the user is asking for the current year's date. Since the search_holiday function defaults to the current year if not provided. But without internet, the function can't run. So, the answer should state that Christmas is on December 25th, and if they need the weekday, they can check another source or enable Wi-Fi. \n\nI should make sure to answer the question as much as possible without the function. Since the function is unavailable, use common knowledge. But maybe the user expects the date, so the answer is December 25th. However, the user mentioned \"what day it falls on,\" which could mean the date or the weekday. Clarify if needed, but based on prior, they might need the date. \n\nWait, the initial question was \"Christmas Day when?\" which is likely asking for the date. So the answer is December 25th. However, the user's follow-up says they're not sure what day, so maybe they need the weekday. But without internet, I can't get that. So explain that Christmas is December 25th, and the weekday varies. Suggest checking a calendar or enabling Wi-Fi for the current year's info.\n</think>\n\nChristmas Day is always celebrated on **December 25th** of each year. However, the specific weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) it falls on changes annually. For example, in 2023, Christmas was on a Monday, and in 2024, it will be on a Wednesday. \n\nIf you'd like to know the exact weekday for a specific year, I can look that up for you—just let me know the year!
