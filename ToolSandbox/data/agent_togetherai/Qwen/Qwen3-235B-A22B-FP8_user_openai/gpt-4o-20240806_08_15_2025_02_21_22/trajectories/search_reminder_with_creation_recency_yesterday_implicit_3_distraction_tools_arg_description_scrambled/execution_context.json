                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the todo item they made yesterday. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the time frame for \"yesterday.\" Since the user is asking about a reminder or todo item created yesterday, I should determine the start and end timestamps for that day.\n\nThe current timestamp was obtained as 1755244461.341038. To find yesterday's start, I need to subtract one day from the current timestamp and then adjust it to the beginning of that day (midnight). Similarly, the end of yesterday would be just before midnight of the current day.\n\nWait, but how do I handle date shifts correctly? Let me think. Using the shift_timestamp function, I can subtract 1 day from the current timestamp to get a point in time yesterday. Then, I can convert that to a date and set the time to 00:00:00 to get the lower bound. The upper bound would be the same date at 23:59:59.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (which is 86400 seconds) to get the same point yesterday. But daylight saving changes might affect this if the current time is near a DST change. However, since we're dealing with a general \"yesterday,\" maybe shifting by days is acceptable.\n\nSo, first, shift the current timestamp by -1 day to get a timestamp that's yesterday. Then, convert that to the start of the day (midnight) as the lower bound for creation_timestamp. Then, shift that same timestamp by +1 day minus 1 second to get the upper bound (23:59:59 of the previous day).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: the creation_timestamp_lowerbound should be the start of yesterday (midnight), and creation_timestamp_upperbound should be the start of today (midnight). Because \"yesterday\" typically refers to the entire day before today. So any reminder created between midnight yesterday and midnight today would be considered as made yesterday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (done, it's 1755244461.341038).\n2. Shift that timestamp by -1 day to get a point in yesterday.\n3. Convert that shifted timestamp to a datetime with date parts (year, month, day) of yesterday.\n4. Then, create a timestamp for the start of that day (00:00:00) as the lower bound.\n5. The upper bound would be the start of the current day (midnight today).\n\nWait, but how to get the start of yesterday's day? Let me use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the shifted timestamp (yesterday's time) to get the year, month, day. Then set the time to 00:00:00 for that day. Then convert that datetime back to a timestamp as the lower bound. Similarly, upper bound would be the same day at 23:59:59, or the start of the next day (which is the same as today's midnight).\n\nAlternatively, using the shift_timestamp function to subtract the necessary hours, minutes, seconds to get to midnight of the current timestamp's day, then subtract one day to get the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Let me outline:\n\nCurrent timestamp: T.\n\nStart of today (midnight) is T minus the hours, minutes, seconds of T's time. Then, start of yesterday would be start of today minus 24 hours. But perhaps using the shift_timestamp function with days=-1 and then adjust to midnight.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nUse timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get today's date. Then subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then convert that date at 00:00:00 to a timestamp. Then, convert that same date at 23:59:59 to a timestamp. Those would be the lower and upper bounds for creation_timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Current timestamp T = 1755244461.341038 (from previous step).\n\n2. Convert T to datetime info: call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T. This gives year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n\nAssuming the result is, say, year=2025, month=8, day=16, hour=12, minute=34, etc. (since 1755244461 is around August 16, 2025, 12:34:21 UTC).\n\n3. Subtract one day from that date to get yesterday's date. For example, if today is 16th, yesterday is 15th.\n\n4. Then create a datetime for that date at 00:00:00. Convert that to a timestamp as creation_timestamp_lowerbound.\n\n5. Then create a datetime for that date at 23:59:59. Convert that to a timestamp as creation_timestamp_upperbound.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the conversion from date to timestamp? I can use datetime_info_to_timestamp function. So:\n\nFor lowerbound:\n\nyear = today's year, month = today's month, day = today's day -1, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut need to handle month/year transitions if day is 1.\n\nBut the function should handle that. So:\n\nAfter getting today's datetime info, subtract 1 from day (or use shift_timestamp to get yesterday's date, then set time to 0).\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by -1 day to get a timestamp in yesterday, then convert that to datetime info, set the time to 0, then convert back to timestamp. But that might not account for the entire day. Wait, but if you take the current timestamp, subtract 1 day, then convert to datetime, then set the time to 00:00:00, that gives the start of yesterday. Then, adding 1 day to that start gives the start of today, which is the upper bound.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncreation_timestamp_lowerbound = start of yesterday (midnight)\ncreation_timestamp_upperbound = start of today (midnight)\n\nSo:\n\nstart_of_today = T - (hours*3600 + minutes*60 + seconds)\nstart_of_yesterday = start_of_today - 86400 (24*3600)\n\nBut since I can't do arithmetic here, I need to use the functions.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on T to subtract the current hours, minutes, seconds to get start_of_today. Then subtract another day to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose T is the current timestamp. To get start_of_today (midnight), we can shift T by -hours, -minutes, -seconds.\n\nBut how? The shift_timestamp function allows shifting by weeks, days, hours, etc. So:\n\nIf the current time is, say, 12:34:21, then shifting by -12 hours, -34 minutes, -21 seconds would give the start of today.\n\nBut since the actual values depend on the current time, which we don't know unless we first call timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Current timestamp T.\n\n2. Convert T to datetime info to get year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\n3. Shift T by -hour hours, -minute minutes, -second seconds. This would take us to midnight of today.\n\n4. Then shift by -1 day to get midnight of yesterday. That's start_of_yesterday.\n\nBut wait, shifting T by -hour, etc., would give the start of today. Then shifting that by -1 day gives start of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, after getting start_of_today, subtract 86400 seconds (24 hours) to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nBut using the shift_timestamp function, perhaps:\n\ncall shift_timestamp with timestamp=T, hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second. That gives start_of_today.\n\nThen shift that by days=-1 to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, get the datetime info of T (timestamp_to_datetime_info(T)), which gives hour, minute, second.\n\nThen shift T by -hour hours, -minute minutes, -second seconds to get start_of_today.\n\nThen shift start_of_today by -1 day to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nThen shift start_of_today by +0 days (or use start_of_today) as the upper bound (since upper bound is start of today).\n\nSo creation_timestamp_lowerbound = start_of_yesterday\n\ncreation_timestamp_upperbound = start_of_today\n\nThis way, any reminder created between midnight yesterday and midnight today would be considered as made yesterday.\n\nSo now, I need to call the functions step by step.\n\nFirst, after getting T (current timestamp), the next step is to convert it to datetime info to get the hour, minute, second.\n\nSo next function call: timestamp_to_datetime_info with T.\n\nThen, use that to get the hour, minute, second. Then shift T by those negative values to get start_of_today.\n\nThen shift start_of_today by -1 day to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nThen use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound=start_of_yesterday and creation_timestamp_upperbound=start_of_today.\n\nOnce that's done, the search_reminder function will return all reminders created in that interval.\n\nThen present those to the user.\n\nSo the next tool call should be timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"timestamp_to_datetime_info\", \"arguments\": {\"timestamp",
