|                       |                       |                       | First, I need to figure out the date of Christmas Day this year.     |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | Christmas is on December 25th every year. So if the current year is  |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | 2023, then Christmas is 2023-12-25. But wait, what if today's date   |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |

|                       |                       |                       | and the count would be next year's. But the user probably means the  |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |

|                       |                       |                       | December 25th has already occurred this year. If it has, then use    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
