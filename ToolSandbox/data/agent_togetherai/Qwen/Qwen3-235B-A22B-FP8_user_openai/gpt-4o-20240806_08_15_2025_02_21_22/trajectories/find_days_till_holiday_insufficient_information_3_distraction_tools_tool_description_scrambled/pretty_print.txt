|                       |                       |                       | timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. But since the |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | assistant can't know the current timestamp, this requires the user   |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | to provide it. However, the user hasn't provided it, so the          |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |

|                       |                       |                       | can't answer without additional information. But the user expects an |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | answer, so there must be a way. Maybe the assistant should use the   |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
