                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact date and time for next Friday. Since today's date isn't provided, I should use the current timestamp to calculate it. Let me check the current date and time using the get_current_timestamp function. That will give me the starting point.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can convert it to datetime information to find out what day of the week it is. Then, calculate the number of days needed to reach the next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, adding 2 days would get to Friday. If today is Friday, then adding 7 days. Wait, but the user said \"next Friday,\" which could mean the upcoming Friday even if today is Friday. Hmm, need to clarify that. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe assume that \"next Friday\" is the first Friday after today, even if today is Friday. But how to handle that in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current weekday. Let's say the current day is 'isoweekday' where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday. Friday is 5. So if today's isoweekday is less than 5, then the difference is 5 - current_day. If it's equal to 5, then add 7 days. If it's more than 5 (like Saturday or Sunday), then 5 + (7 - current_day) + 1? Wait, maybe better to calculate the next Friday as follows: days_until_friday = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. Then add that number of days plus 7 if it's zero? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. For example:\n\n- If today is Friday (5), then days_until_friday would be 0, but we want next Friday, so add 7 days.\n- If today is Saturday (6), days_until_friday = (5 -6 +7) = 6 mod7 =6, so add 6 days.\n- If today is Thursday (4), days_until_friday = (5-4 +7) =8 mod7=1, so add 1 day.\n\nHmm, that formula gives the number of days until next Friday. Wait, maybe (5 - current_day) % 7. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf current_day is 3 (Wednesday), (5-3) =2, so 2 days added. That works.\n\nIf current_day is 5 (Friday), (5-5) =0, so 0 days, but we need to add 7 days to get to the next Friday. So perhaps if the result is 0, add 7 days. Alternatively, add 7 days in that case.\n\nAlternatively, use (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_day =5 (Friday): (5-5 +7)=7 mod7=0. Hmm, but adding 0 days. Not helpful. So maybe:\n\nIf current_day ==5, then add 7 days. Otherwise, calculate (5 - current_day) %7. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the days until next Friday:\n\ndays_ahead = (4 - current_day + 7) %7 +1 ?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\nIf today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nIf not, then find how many days until next Friday.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_day =1 (Monday): 4 days until Friday (1 +4 =5). So add 4 days.\n\ncurrent_day=2 (Tuesday): add 3 days.\n\ncurrent_day=3 (Wednesday): add 2 days.\n\ncurrent_day=4 (Thursday): add 1 day.\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): add 7 days.\n\ncurrent_day=6 (Saturday): add 6 days (since next Friday is 6 days ahead: Sat -> Sun (1), Mon (2), ..., Fri (6 days later).\n\ncurrent_day=7 (Sunday): add 5 days (Monday +1, Tuesday +2, ..., Friday +5).\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nif current_day <5: days_ahead =5 - current_day\n\nif current_day ==5: days_ahead=7\n\nif current_day >5: days_ahead= (7 - current_day) +4 (since 7 - current_day +4 = (4 days after Sunday minus current_day). Wait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_day=6: 7-6=1, +4=5. But adding 5 days to Saturday would be Thursday? No. Wait, 6 (Saturday) + days_ahead=6. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\ndays_ahead = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nBut if current_day is Friday (5), then (5-5)=0, so days_ahead=0. But we need to add 7 days. So perhaps days_ahead is (5 - current_day +7) %7 ?\n\nLet's compute:\n\ncurrent_day=1: (5-1+7)=11 mod7=4. So 4 days ahead, correct.\n\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. Still zero. So in that case, add 7 days.\n\nWait, so:\n\ndays_ahead = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nif days_ahead ==0, days_ahead=7.\n\nSo that would work.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5)=0 mod7, so days_ahead=7.\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6)= -1 mod7=6. So days_ahead=6. Which is correct.\n\ncurrent_day=7: (5-7)= -2 mod7=5. days_ahead=5.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days_ahead as (5 - isoweekday) %7. If the result is 0, set days_ahead=7.\n\n4. Calculate the date for next Friday by adding days_ahead days to current date.\n\nThen, set the time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nBut how to compute the exact timestamp for next Friday 5 PM?\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current datetime info, compute the date for next Friday, then create a datetime object for that date at 17:00, then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut since the functions available are datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\n- Convert that to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n\n- Compute days_ahead as (5 - isoweekday) %7. If days_ahead ==0, set to 7.\n\n- Add days_ahead days to current date to get next Friday's date.\n\n- Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n\n- Convert this new datetime info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nOnce I have that timestamp, I can call add_reminder with the content and the computed timestamp.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify a location, so latitude and longitude are optional and can be omitted.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get current_ts.\n\n2. Convert current_ts to datetime_info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\n3. From datetime_info, get isoweekday.\n\n4. Calculate days_ahead as (5 - isoweekday) %7. If days_ahead ==0, set days_ahead=7.\n\n5. Add days_ahead to current date to get next Friday's date.\n\n6. Create a new datetime_info with that date, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n7. Convert this new datetime_info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\n8. Call add_reminder with content \"Reminder next Friday 5PM\" and reminder_timestamp the computed timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the date addition? Since we have the current date's year, month, day, adding days_ahead may require handling month and year transitions, but the functions available don't handle date arithmetic, so we need to compute it.\n\nWait, but how can I add days_ahead to the current date? For example, if current date is 2023-10-05 (Thursday), days_ahead is 1, so next Friday is 2023-10-06. But adding days to the current date requires knowing how many days are in the current month, etc. Since we don't have a function to handle that, maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info and datetime_info_to_timestamp functions can help. Because if we take the current timestamp, add days_ahead * 86400 seconds (number of seconds in a day), then convert that timestamp to datetime_info, which will handle the date correctly.\n\nAh, right! So instead of manually adding days to the date, we can compute the timestamp for next Friday 5 PM as follows:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\nts_for_next_friday = current_ts + days_ahead * 86400\n\nThen, convert ts_for_next_friday to datetime_info, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but no. Because days_ahead is the number of days to add to reach next Friday. So",
