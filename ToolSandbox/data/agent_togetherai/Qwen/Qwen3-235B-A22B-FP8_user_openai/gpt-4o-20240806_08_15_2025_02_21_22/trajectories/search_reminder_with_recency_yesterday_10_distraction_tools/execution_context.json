                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what functions are available. The tools provided include functions like search_reminder, which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The user wants to find reminders from yesterday. \n\nBut wait, how do I define \"yesterday\"? I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. To do that, I might use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time, then subtract a day. However, the user might not have specified a particular time, so maybe I should consider the entire day of yesterday.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function allows specifying a reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So if I can find the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday, then set those as the bounds, that would capture all reminders that are set for yesterday.\n\nBut how to calculate those timestamps? The tools available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which can convert date and time into a timestamp. Alternatively, using get_current_timestamp and shifting it with shift_timestamp. Let me think.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp. Let's say today is 2023-10-05. Then yesterday would be 2023-10-04. The start of yesterday would be 00:00 on the 4th, and the end would be 23:59:59 on the 4th. To get those timestamps, I can use datetime_info_to_timestamp for the start (year, month, day as yesterday, time 00:00:00) and end (23:59:59). But how to get yesterday's date?\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, subtract one day's worth of seconds (86400) to get a timestamp for the same time yesterday. But then to get the start and end of that day, I need to adjust the hours, minutes, seconds. That might be complicated. Maybe using datetime_info_to_timestamp would be better.\n\nWait, but to use datetime_info_to_timestamp, I need to know the year, month, day, etc. So first, I need to get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to find out what day it is, subtract a day, then create the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut the available functions don't include a way to get the current date components directly. The get_current_timestamp gives the current timestamp, and then timestamp_to_datetime_info can convert that into date components. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that to get today's date (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Subtract one day from that date to get yesterday's date. However, handling month and year transitions here would be necessary, but the functions might handle that automatically if I use shift_timestamp. Wait, maybe shift_timestamp can be used to shift the current timestamp by -1 days to get a timestamp that is 24 hours ago. Then, for that timestamp, extract the date part (ignoring the time) to get yesterday's date.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Alternatively, maybe shift the current timestamp by -1 day, then set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound, and 23:59:59 for the upper bound.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp with get_current_timestamp. Let's call this T0.\n\nThen, shift T0 by -1 day to get T1, which is the same time yesterday.\n\nBut to get the start of yesterday (midnight), we can take T1's date components and set the time to 00:00:00. However, since we can't directly manipulate date components, maybe we can use datetime_info_to_timestamp again.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T0) using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert T0 to datetime info (D0) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Shift D0's day by -1 to get yesterday's date (but need to handle month/year changes, which might be tricky manually. Maybe using shift_timestamp again to get a timestamp that is one day earlier, then convert to datetime info to get the adjusted date components.)\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by -1 day using shift_timestamp, then convert that to datetime info. For example:\n\n- Call shift_timestamp with T0, days=-1 to get T1, which is 24 hours before T0.\n- Convert T1 to datetime info (D1), which gives the date (year, month, day) of yesterday.\n- Then create lowerbound: datetime_info_to_timestamp(year=D1.year, month=D1.month, day=D1.day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0)\n- And upperbound: datetime_info_to_timestamp(year=D1.year, month=D1.month, day=D1.day, hour=23, minute=59, second=59)\n\nThis way, the lowerbound and upperbound would cover all timestamps within yesterday's day.\n\nOnce those bounds are calculated, call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to those values. That would retrieve all reminders set for yesterday.\n\nSo the steps require multiple function calls:\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, shift that by -1 day to get T1.\n\nConvert T1 to datetime info to get the date parts for yesterday.\n\nThen convert those date parts into the start and end of that day.\n\nThen use those timestamps as bounds in search_reminder.\n\nBut since the assistant can only call functions one at a time, I need to proceed step by step. However, in the initial response, the assistant can only make one tool call. Wait, the user's question is ambiguous in that the assistant needs to determine the correct approach and make the necessary function calls. But according to the instructions, the assistant should return the tool calls needed. However, each turn allows the assistant to make one or more tool calls. But in the example, it's possible that the assistant might need to chain function calls.\n\nBut in this case, the user's query is \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So the assistant needs to figure out the correct time window for \"yesterday\" and then search for reminders in that window.\n\nGiven that, the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then shift it back by one day, then calculate the start and end of that day. However, the assistant can't perform multiple steps unless each step is a function call. So perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user might expect the system to handle this automatically. However, since the assistant is supposed to call the necessary functions, perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp to determine what day it is, then proceed.\n\nBut in the context of the tools provided, the assistant can't perform calculations outside the functions. So the process would involve:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get T0.\n2. Use shift_timestamp to get T1 = T0 -1 day.\n3. Convert T1 to datetime_info to get the date parts (year, month, day) of yesterday.\n4. Convert those date parts to lowerbound (midnight) and upperbound (23:59:59).\n5. Call search_reminder with those bounds.\n\nBut each of these steps requires a function call, and the assistant can only make one function call per turn. So how to proceed?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can first call get_current_timestamp. Once the current timestamp is known, the next step would be to shift it by -1 day, then convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info to get the date parts. Then, create the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut since each function call requires a separate step, and the assistant's response must include the tool calls it wants to execute, but the assistant can only call functions based on the information available.\n\nIn this case, the user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" needs to be converted into a timestamp range. The assistant needs to calculate that, but to do so, it needs to call several functions. However, the assistant can't execute multiple steps in one go. Therefore, the first step would be to get the current timestamp.\n\nSo the assistant's first tool call should be to get_current_timestamp. Once that's obtained, the next step would be to shift it by -1 day, and so on. However, since the assistant can't perform multiple steps without the user's input, perhaps in this case, the assistant should proceed step by step.\n\nBut in the context of the current problem, the assistant is supposed to generate the necessary tool calls in one response. However, since the assistant can't know the current timestamp without calling the function, the first step is to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nTherefore, the correct initial tool call is get_current_timestamp. Once that's obtained, subsequent steps can proceed. However, since the user's question is a single query, perhaps the assistant should chain the necessary functions in its reasoning and make the appropriate calls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. The search_reminder function allows specifying reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. If the user wants reminders from yesterday, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function twice: once to get the start of yesterday and once for the end.\n\nBut without knowing the current timestamp, that's impossible. Therefore, the assistant must first get the current timestamp.\n\nIn conclusion, the assistant should first call get_current_timestamp to determine the current time, then proceed to calculate yesterday's date. However, since this is the first step, the tool call should be get_current_timestamp.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"get_current_timestamp\", \"arguments\": {}",
