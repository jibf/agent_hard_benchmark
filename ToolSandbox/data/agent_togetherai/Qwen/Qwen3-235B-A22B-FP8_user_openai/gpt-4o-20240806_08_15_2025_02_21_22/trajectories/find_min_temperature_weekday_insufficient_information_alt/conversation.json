But wait, the function provided is timestamp_to_datetime_info, which converts a timestamp to date info. However, the user isn't providing a timestamp; they're asking for a forecast. \n\nWait, the function available only converts a timestamp to date details. It doesn't relate to weather data. So, there's a problem here. The user is asking about temperature, which isn't covered by the given functions. The available tool can't retrieve weather info. \n\nI should check if there's a way to use the provided function. Maybe the user intended to provide a timestamp, but their question is about a forecast. Since the function can't access real-time data or weather info, I can't answer their question with the tools given. \n\nTherefore, I need to inform the user that I can't provide the temperature for this Friday because the necessary function isn't available. Also, clarify that the existing tool only converts timestamps to date information. They might need a weather API, which isn't accessible here.\n</think>\n\nThe function provided (`timestamp_to_datetime_info`) converts a POSIX timestamp to date/time details (e.g., year, month, day, weekday) but does not provide weather or temperature data. Since your question is about temperature (\"how cold does it get\"), none of the available functions can address this. \n\nTo proceed, you would need a weather API or historical temperature data source, which is not accessible here. Let me know if you'd like help with date/time conversions or other supported tasks!"
