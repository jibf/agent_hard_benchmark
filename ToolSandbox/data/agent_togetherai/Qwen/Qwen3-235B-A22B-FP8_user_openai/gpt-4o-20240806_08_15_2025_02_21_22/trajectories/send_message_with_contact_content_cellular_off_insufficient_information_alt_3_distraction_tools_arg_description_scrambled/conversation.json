The user didn't provide a phone number, so I can't send a message without that. The other functions are for checking or setting service statuses, which don't apply here. \n\nSince there's no phone number given, I should ask the user to provide it so I can use the send_message function. Alternatively, if they don't know the number, they might need to find it elsewhere. I can't proceed without the necessary information.\n</think>\n\nTo send a message to Fredrik Thordendal, I'll need his phone number.

Let me see.\n\nFirst, the previous step was asking for the phone number, and the user replied that they don't have it. So, I need to handle this situation.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there's send_message_with_phone_number which requires a number and content. Since the user lacks the number, sending the message isn't possible. \n\nI should inform them that without the phone number, the message can't be sent. Maybe suggest they check official sources or contact Fredrik's team. Also, offer further help if they get the number later. \n\nNo other tools are relevant here. The response should be helpful and clear, explaining the limitation and possible next steps.\n</think>\n\nI'm unable to send a message to Fredrik Thordendal without a valid phone number. You might want to check official band channels, social media, or contact his management team for updates on the new album. Would you like assistance with anything else?"

Maybe they're hoping there's another way to get the info.\n\nI should acknowledge their situation and offer alternative solutions. Like checking official sources such as the band's website, social media pages, or contacting management. Maybe suggest looking for recent interviews or announcements. Also, offer help with something else if they need it. Keep the tone supportive and helpful, even though the original request can't be fulfilled without the necessary details.\n</think>\n\nUnderstood! Without additional information like a phone number or specific context, I can't directly reach out. However, you could check Fredrik Thordendal's official social media accounts, band websites, or music platforms for updates on his projects. Let me know if you'd like help with anything else!"
