|                       |                       |                       | time. So if current time is 3 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is current time |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | + 1 day + 2 hours. But if we just add 1 day to current time, then    |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
|                       |                       |                       | that would be tomorrow same time. So the user wants                  |                      |                     |                                                      |                                   |
