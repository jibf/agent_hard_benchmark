                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out which functions to use here. \n\nThey mentioned \"upcoming reminder,\" so maybe I should start by searching for that reminder. But wait, the user didn't specify the reminder's ID or content. Hmm, maybe I need to ask for clarification. However, the user might expect me to assume they have an upcoming reminder and just need to adjust the time.\n\nWait, the tools available include modify_reminder, which requires a reminder_id. Without knowing the reminder's ID, I can't proceed with modifying it. So perhaps I should first use search_reminder to find the upcoming reminder. But how? The search_reminder function can take parameters like reminder_timestamp_upperbound or lowerbound. Since the user says \"upcoming,\" maybe the reminder is set for today. But I don't know the exact time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to shift the reminder by a certain time. The user said \"tomorrow 5 PM,\" so I need to calculate that timestamp. Let me think. To get tomorrow's 5 PM, I can get the current timestamp, add one day, and set the time to 17:00. But how to do that with the available functions?\n\nLooking at the functions, there's get_current_timestamp, which gives the current time. Then shift_timestamp can add days and hours. So first, get the current timestamp. Then shift it by 1 day and 17 hours minus the current hour. Wait, maybe better to calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. Let's break it down.\n\nWait, the user might have a reminder that's already scheduled, and they want to change its time to tomorrow 5 PM. So the steps are: 1. Find the upcoming reminder (but need criteria). 2. Modify its reminder_timestamp to tomorrow 5 PM. However, without knowing the reminder's ID or content, this is tricky. The search_reminder function might require some parameters. If the user has only one upcoming reminder, maybe search without parameters and then pick the first one? But the search_reminder function's required parameters are none, so it can return all reminders. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be referring to the next reminder. But the system can't assume that. So perhaps the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a timestamp, then modify the reminder with that new timestamp. But without knowing the reminder_id, I can't call modify_reminder. \n\nThis is a problem. The user hasn't provided the reminder ID. So maybe I need to ask them to clarify which reminder they want to modify. However, the user might expect that \"upcoming\" is enough. But the system requires the reminder_id. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the reminder ID is needed to proceed. \n\nWait, but maybe the user's message implies that they have only one upcoming reminder. In that case, perhaps I should search for reminders with a reminder_timestamp in the near future. For example, using the search_reminder function with a lowerbound of current timestamp and upperbound of current timestamp + 24 hours. Then, if there's exactly one result, take that reminder's ID and modify it. \n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n2. Use shift_timestamp to calculate tomorrow's time (current + 1 day).\n3. Wait, no. The user wants tomorrow at 5 PM. So regardless of current time, the new reminder time is tomorrow at 17:00. So first, get the current timestamp, then calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. \n\nBut how to set the time to 5 PM tomorrow. Let's break down:\n\n- Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp.\n- Convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n- Then, increment the day by 1, set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to handle month/year changes if it's the last day of the month?\n- Alternatively, use the shift_timestamp function with days=1, then set the time to 17:00. But shift_timestamp can only add deltas, not set exact times. So maybe after shifting by one day, adjust the hours. Wait, but if current time is 3 PM, adding 1 day and 2 hours would get to tomorrow 5 PM. But that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, create a datetime for tomorrow at 5 PM and convert that to timestamp. To do that, take the current timestamp, shift by 1 day, then use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the date parts, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp. But how?\n\nAlternatively, use get_current_timestamp, shift by 24 hours (but shift_timestamp requires days, hours, etc. parameters). Wait, shift_timestamp's parameters include days and hours. So to get tomorrow at 5 PM, first get current timestamp, then shift by 1 day, then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to adjust the hour. Wait, shift_timestamp can't set exact hours, it's a delta. So if the current time is 2 PM, adding 1 day and 3 hours would get to tomorrow 5 PM. But that's not reliable because the current hour varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate tomorrow's date (current date + 1 day), then set the time to 17:00. To do that:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert to datetime info: year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add one day to day, handling month/year transitions.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert that datetime back to a timestamp.\n\nBut the available functions don't allow adding days to a datetime. The functions available are datetime_info_to_timestamp, which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So the steps would be:\n\n- Use get_current_timestamp to get current_time.\n- Convert current_time to datetime_info with timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n- Increment day by 1. If that overflows the month, need to handle that (but the function would handle it?), but the user might not have a reminder on the next day if the current day is the last day of the month. But perhaps the function takes care of that.\n- Then set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp, then convert to datetime info. Then adjust the day and time. Then convert back.\n\nBut how to handle the incrementing day? For example, if the current datetime is 2023-10-31, adding one day would be November 1st. The timestamp_to_datetime_info would give day=31, adding 1 would make 32, but the function might not handle that. Wait, the datetime_info is after conversion, so if you have day=31 and add 1, that's 32, but when converting back with datetime_info_to_timestamp, it would correctly roll over to the next month. Or maybe not. The function might require valid dates. Hmm, this could be a problem. Alternatively, using shift_timestamp with days=1 would handle that correctly. Because shifting the timestamp by 24 hours would account for day changes.\n\nSo here's a better approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n2. Shift it by days=1 to get tomorrow's same time.\n3. Then, convert that timestamp to datetime_info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n4. Set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert that datetime_info back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but step 2 and 3: if we shift the current time by 1 day, that gives tomorrow same time. Then adjust the hour to 17:00. But how? For example, if current time is 2023-10-30 14:00:00, shifting by 1 day gives 2023-10-31 14:00:00. Then changing hour to 17 would be 2023-10-31 17:00:00. Then convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to do steps 3 and 4? Because after shifting, we need to change the hour. So:\n\n- Call shift_timestamp with days=1 to get tomorrow's same time.\n- Convert that shifted timestamp to datetime_info.\n- Modify the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that's possible. So first, shift by 1 day, then adjust the hour.\n\nBut the user wants tomorrow at 5 PM regardless of current time. So even if current time is 5 PM, it's tomorrow same time, but then adjust the day again? Wait, no. If current time is 5 PM today, then adding 1 day would be tomorrow at 5 PM. So if the user wants tomorrow at 5 PM, shifting current time by days=1 would already be that. Wait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5 PM\" regardless of current time. So if current time is 3 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is current time + 1 day + 2 hours. But if we just add 1 day to current time, then that would be tomorrow same time. So the user wants",
