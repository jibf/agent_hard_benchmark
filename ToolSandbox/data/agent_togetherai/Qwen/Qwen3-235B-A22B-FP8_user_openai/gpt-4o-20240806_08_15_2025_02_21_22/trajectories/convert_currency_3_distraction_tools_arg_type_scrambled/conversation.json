I used the convert_currency function with the parameters amount=2048, from_currency_code=USD, to_currency_code=CNY. The response came back as 14705.15376128 CNY.\n\nI need to present this answer clearly. First, I'll state the converted amount. Then, maybe add a note that exchange rates fluctuate, so the actual value might vary slightly. That way, the user knows it's an approximate figure based on the current rate at the time of conversion. Also, I should format the numbers properly, using commas for thousands and two decimal places as usual for currency. Wait, the response has more decimal places. Should I round it to two? Probably, since most currencies use two decimal places. So 14,705.15 CNY. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me check if there's any other info needed, but I think that's it. Just make sure the user understands the conversion is based on the current exchange rate and might not be exact.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is approximately **14,705.15 CNY** based on the current exchange rate. \n\nNote: Exchange rates fluctuate frequently, so the actual amount may vary slightly depending on the market rate at the time of conversion."
