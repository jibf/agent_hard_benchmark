                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to set that up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current date isn't specified, I'll use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time and then calculate tomorrow's date. Wait, but how do I handle the 5 PM part?\n\nWait, maybe I should get the current timestamp first. Then, add one day to it. Let me check the available functions. There's shift_timestamp which can add days, hours, etc. So first, get the current timestamp. Then shift it by 1 day and 17 hours (since 5 PM is 17:00 in 24-hour time). Wait, but maybe the user's current time zone matters? The functions probably handle that based on the system's time zone settings.\n\nSo steps: call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then use shift_timestamp with that timestamp, adding 1 day and 17 hours. That should give the correct timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nOnce I have the timestamp, I can call add_reminder with the content \"buy chocolate milk\" and the calculated timestamp. The latitude and longitude are optional, but the user didn't specify a location, so I'll omit those.\n\nWait, but maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for tomorrow at 5 PM regardless of the current time. So I need to make sure that even if the current time is 6 PM, adding 1 day would take it to the next day's 6 PM, but the user wants 5 PM. Hmm, no, maybe the user expects \"tomorrow 5 PM\" to be exactly that time, not relative to current time. Wait, but how can I handle that? For example, if the current time is today at 10 AM, tomorrow 5 PM is 29 hours from now. So shifting by 1 day and 7 hours (since 5 PM is 17 hours, subtract 10 hours to get 7 hours added). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. If I can get tomorrow's date and set the time to 5 PM. For that, I need to know tomorrow's year, month, day. But to do that, I need to get the current date and time, then compute tomorrow's date, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. However, the functions available don't directly allow that. The datetime_info_to_timestamp requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So if I can get the current datetime info, add one day, then set the hour, minute, second accordingly. But the functions available are get_current_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (and handle month/year if necessary, but that's complicated).\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert that datetime info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut since the functions are limited, maybe the first approach with shifting the current timestamp by 1 day and then adjusting the time to 5 PM is better. However, if the current time is 10 PM, adding 1 day would take it to 10 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So we need to adjust the time. So perhaps:\n\nCalculate the desired time as follows: take the current timestamp, shift it to tomorrow at midnight, then add 17 hours.\n\nWait, but how to set the time to exactly 5 PM tomorrow regardless of current time?\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, then shift it by (tomorrow's 5 PM - current time) difference. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Let's say:\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp, then convert to datetime info. Then add one day to the day value. Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the date incrementing. For example, if the current date is 2023-10-31, adding one day would be 2023-11-01. But the functions don't handle that automatically. So the user would need to handle that in code, but since we're using the provided functions, perhaps the best approach is to use get_current_timestamp, then shift_timestamp by 1 day, then adjust the hours to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours. Let's say the current timestamp is T. Then T + 24 hours, then set the hour to 17:00. But how to set the hour? Since we can't do that directly with the available functions, perhaps the way is to shift the timestamp by 1 day and then adjust the hours. Wait, no. Because shifting by 1 day (24 hours) would just add a day, but the time would remain the same. For example, if current time is 10 AM today, adding 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow. Then we need to adjust the time to 5 PM, which is 7 hours later. So total shift would be 1 day and 7 hours.\n\nWait, that's right. So total shift: days=1, hours=7. Because 24 hours + 7 hours = 31 hours. So the total shift is 1 day and 7 hours. So using shift_timestamp with timestamp = current, days=1, hours=7. That would take the current time, add one day (24 hours), then add 7 hours. So if current time is 10 AM, the result would be 5 PM tomorrow. If current time is 8 PM, adding 1 day (8 PM tomorrow) plus 7 hours would be 3 AM the day after. Wait, no. Wait, adding 1 day (24 hours) and 7 hours would be 31 hours. So regardless of current time, adding 31 hours would get to tomorrow's 5 PM (if current time is X, then X + 31 hours = X + 24 +7). Wait, but if current time is 10 AM, adding 24 hours is 10 AM tomorrow, then adding 7 hours is 5 PM tomorrow. If current time is 8 PM, adding 24 hours is 8 PM tomorrow, adding 7 hours is 3 AM day after tomorrow. Which is not what the user wants. The user says \"tomorrow 5 PM\", so regardless of when the user sets the reminder, as long as it's tomorrow at 5 PM, the timestamp should be that exact time. So using shift_timestamp with days=1 and hours=7 would add 31 hours, which is equivalent to tomorrow's 5 PM if the current time is 10 AM. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, suppose current time is 5 PM today. Adding one day (24 hours) would be 5 PM tomorrow. Then adding 0 hours. So if the user wants tomorrow 5 PM, then shifting current timestamp by 1 day would suffice. But if the user sets the reminder at 6 PM today, then shifting by 1 day would be 6 PM tomorrow, which is 1 hour more than needed. So this approach would not work.\n\nSo the correct way is to create a timestamp that is tomorrow at 5 PM, regardless of current time. To do that, perhaps:\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp, then shift it to midnight tomorrow. Then add 17 hours (5 PM). How?\n\nBut how to shift to midnight tomorrow. Let's think: current timestamp is T. Convert T to datetime info. Take the day, add 1, set hour=0, minute=0, second=0. Then get that timestamp and add 17 hours. So:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, ...).\n3. Create a new datetime info with day+1, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Convert that to timestamp (T_midnight_tomorrow).\n5. Then shift T_midnight_tomorrow by 17 hours to get T_reminder = T_midnight_tomorrow + 17 hours.\n\nBut with the available functions, how can this be done?\n\nThe functions available are get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, datetime_info_to_timestamp, etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n- Convert T to datetime_info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. This gives current year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n- Then, increment day by 1. If day exceeds the month's days, increment month and reset day, etc. (But handling that is complex. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that when given correct values. So, assuming the user can provide the correct day, month, year, then we can proceed.)\n\nWait, but the user can't do that automatically. So perhaps the way is to use the shift_timestamp function to shift T by 1 day and then set the time to 17:00. But how?\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by 1 day, then subtract the current time (hours, minutes, seconds) and add 17 hours. But without knowing the current",
