The available functions are for converting dates to timestamps, converting timestamps back to dates, and getting an address from coordinates. \n\nWait, none of these tools are related to weather data. The user wants temperature information, but I don't have a function that can access weather forecasts. The existing tools are just for date conversion and reverse geocoding. \n\nI should check if there's any way to use the current tools to answer the question. For example, if the user provided coordinates, maybe I could get the address, but even then, there's no weather data function. The question is about temperature on a specific day, which requires a weather API.\n\nSince I don't have access to a weather API, I can't retrieve that information. I need to inform the user that I can't answer their question with the available tools. I should also mention that if they have specific coordinates, I can help with the location, but the temperature part isn't possible right now.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to live weather data or forecasts. However, if you provide coordinates (latitude/longitude), I can help identify the location's address. Would you like me to do that?"

But they clarified, \"It has to do with the temperature, not the location.\" Hmm, so they want a temperature forecast for Friday but didn't provide a location.\n\nWait, the tools I have don't include a weather API. The available functions are for converting dates to timestamps and vice versa, and getting an address from coordinates. Since they don't want location-based address lookup, and there's no weather tool, I can't provide the temperature. I need to inform them I can't access live weather data. Maybe suggest they check a weather service. Also, check if there's any other tool I can use, but looking at the provided functions, none relate to weather. So my response should be that I can't help with that and suggest an alternative.\n</think>\n\nI currently don't have access to live weather data or forecasting capabilities. For temperature forecasts, I recommend checking a dedicated weather service like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your local meteorological department's official platform.\n\nIf you'd like help with date/time conversions or location lookups (using coordinates), I can assist with those types of tasks using my available tools."

Now they're thanking me and saying it's okay.\n\nI should acknowledge their thanks and keep the door open for future help. Maybe add a friendly sign-off. No need for any tool calls here since they're just expressing gratitude. Keep it simple and polite.\n</think>\n\nYou're very welcome! I appreciate your understanding.
