I told them I can't access live weather data and offered to help with location using coordinates. They clarified they need temperature, not location. I suggested checking weather services and mentioned I can help with date/time or location if needed. Now they're thanking me and saying it's okay.\n\nI should acknowledge their thanks and keep the door open for future help. Maybe add a friendly sign-off. No need for any tool calls here since they're just expressing gratitude. Keep it simple and polite.\n</think>\n\nYou're very welcome! I appreciate your understanding. If you have any other questions I can help with, whether it's about dates, locations, or other technical conversions, feel free to ask. 😊",
