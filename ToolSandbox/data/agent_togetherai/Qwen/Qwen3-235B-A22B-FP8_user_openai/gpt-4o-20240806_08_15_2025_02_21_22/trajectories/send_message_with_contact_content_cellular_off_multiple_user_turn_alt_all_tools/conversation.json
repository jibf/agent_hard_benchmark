Then, I tried to send the message using the send_message_with_phone_number function. But there was a ConnectionError because cellular service was off.\n\nThe user then asked to enable cellular service. I called the set_cellular_service_status function with on: true. The response was None, which probably means it was successful. Now, I need to confirm that cellular service is on and then try sending the message again. Wait, but did the initial message send after turning on cellular? The user hasn't mentioned it yet. Maybe the send attempt after enabling service is needed. But the last tool call was just to enable the service. The user's current query was to turn it on, so after that, maybe the next step is to send the message again. However, the user hasn't explicitly asked to send the message again yet. So the response should confirm that cellular is on and ask if they want to proceed with sending the message. Alternatively, since the user's last action was enabling cellular, maybe the message sending is part of that process. Wait, looking at the history: user said \"Yes, please go ahead and turn it on.\" Then the tool call was made to enable cellular. The response was None. Now, the assistant needs to inform that cellular is on and then perhaps prompt to send the message. But the initial message sending attempt was before enabling cellular. So after enabling, the user might need to confirm sending again. But the user hasn't asked again. Hmm. Maybe the assistant should confirm that cellular is enabled and then ask if they want to send the message now. Alternatively, since the user's original intent was to send the message, after enabling service, the assistant should automatically try sending again. But according to the tool's structure, each step requires explicit user input. So the correct approach is to inform that cellular is on and then ask if they want to send the message now. So the response should be: Confirm cellular is on, then prompt to send the message.\n</think>\n\nCellular service has been successfully enabled.

I checked the contacts and found Fredrik's phone number. Then, when trying to send the message, there was a ConnectionError because cellular service was off. The user agreed to turn on cellular service, which I did. Then the user asked to send the message again, which I did successfully. Now, the response from the tool indicates the message was sent with a message ID. The user probably wants confirmation that the message went through. I should inform them that the message was sent successfully and mention the message ID in case they need it for future reference. Keep the response friendly and concise.\n</think>\n\nThe message has been successfully sent to Fredrik Thordendal. The message ID is `b0665606-8d37-4513-b11b-8a7e413b108c` if you need to reference it later. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to do! 📱",
