Let's see, the available functions include search_reminder, which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. \n\nThe user wants reminders from yesterday. To do that, I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. The current timestamp was obtained using get_current_timestamp, which returned 1755245161.108518. That's the current time in POSIX timestamp.\n\nYesterday would be 24 hours before the current time. So subtracting 24*3600 seconds (which is 86400 seconds) from the current timestamp gives the timestamp for yesterday. But wait, the user might want all reminders that were active or set for yesterday, not just the ones created yesterday. Hmm, but the question is about what was on the reminder yesterday, so maybe the reminders that were due yesterday?\n\nWait, the search_reminder function has parameters like reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So if I set the lowerbound to the start of yesterday and the upperbound to the end of yesterday, that should get reminders that were supposed to trigger on that day.\n\nFirst, calculate yesterday's start and end times. The current timestamp is 1755245161.108518. Subtract 86400 to get yesterday's same time. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe need to adjust. However, since the user might be referring to the entire day of yesterday, perhaps using the lower and upper bounds around 24 hours ago.\n\nWait, but the user might not have provided the exact time. So maybe set the lowerbound as current timestamp minus 2*86400 (two days ago) and upperbound as current timestamp minus 86400 (yesterday). Wait, no. Wait, if the user is asking for reminders from yesterday, they might mean reminders that were set to trigger on yesterday's date. But how to determine that without knowing the exact time. Alternatively, maybe the user wants reminders that were created yesterday. But the question is ambiguous. \n\nWait, the original question is \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which could mean reminders that were due yesterday, or reminders created yesterday. Need to clarify. But since the user can't be asked, maybe proceed with one approach. Let's assume that they want reminders that were set to trigger yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be between the start and end of yesterday.\n\nTo get that, take the current timestamp, subtract 86400 to get the same time yesterday. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), need to adjust. However, without knowing the current time's exact date, maybe it's easier to subtract 86400 and then subtract another 86400 to get a range that covers the entire day of yesterday. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe current timestamp is 1755245161.108518. Let's say that's today. So yesterday would be 86400 seconds before that. So lowerbound is (current_timestamp - 86400) - 86400 = current_timestamp - 2*86400. Upperbound is current_timestamp - 86400. Wait, that would be a 24-hour window starting from yesterday's same time to today's same time. But maybe that's not exactly yesterday's day. For example, if the current time is 3 PM today, then yesterday's same time is 3 PM yesterday. So the lowerbound would be 3 PM yesterday and upperbound 3 PM today. That would cover all reminders due between yesterday 3 PM and today 3 PM, which includes all of yesterday's late afternoon and evening. But the user might want all of yesterday, regardless of the current time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended reminders that were due in the last 24 hours, which includes yesterday's time. But the original question is a bit ambiguous. However, since the user said \"yesterday,\" perhaps the correct approach is to get reminders due on the previous day. But without knowing the exact date, how to calculate that? Maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info function can be used to get the current date and then adjust accordingly. But that complicates things. Alternatively, approximate yesterday's start and end by using current_timestamp minus 24 hours and current_timestamp minus 48 hours. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, use the current timestamp and subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get a lowerbound, and then subtract 48 hours (172800 seconds) as the upperbound? No, that would be the wrong way. Wait, to get the last 24 hours, lowerbound would be current_timestamp - 86400, upperbound is current_timestamp. But the user wants yesterday's reminders, which is the entire day before today. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the start of yesterday (midnight) and end of yesterday (11:59:59 PM). But how to calculate that without knowing the current date.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might not be precise, and given the functions available, the best approach is to search for reminders where the reminder_timestamp is between (current_timestamp - 86400) and (current_timestamp). That would include all reminders in the past 24 hours, which would include yesterday's reminders if the current time is in the morning. But if the current time is, say, 10 AM, then 24 hours ago is yesterday 10 AM, so the search would include from yesterday 10 AM to today 10 AM. That might miss some reminders from earlier yesterday morning. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended all reminders created yesterday. But the search_reminder function's creation_timestamp would be used in that case. However, the user's question is about what was on the reminder yesterday, which probably refers to the time when the reminder was supposed to trigger, not when it was created. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the best approach is to proceed by assuming that the user wants reminders that were due in the last 24 hours. But since the user specifically said \"yesterday,\" perhaps a better approach is to calculate the start of yesterday and end of yesterday. However, without knowing the current date, that's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, use the current timestamp and subtract 86400 seconds to get a lowerbound, and then subtract another 86400 to get upperbound? No, that would be the other way. For example, if today is day 0, yesterday is day -1. So to get the entire day of yesterday, the lowerbound would be current_timestamp - 2*86400 (two days ago), and upperbound current_timestamp - 86400 (yesterday). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if today's timestamp is T, then yesterday's midnight would be T - (T % 86400) - 0 seconds (if we consider the start of the day). But that requires knowing the current time's date.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might not be precise, and given the functions available, perhaps the best approach is to search for reminders where the reminder_timestamp is within the last 24 hours. That is, from current_timestamp - 86400 to current_timestamp. Then, the user will get all reminders that were due in the past day, which would include those from yesterday. \n\nSo, using the current timestamp 1755245161.108518, subtract 86400 to get 1755158761.108518 as the lowerbound (reminder_timestamp_lowerbound) and use the current timestamp as upperbound. Wait, but the search_reminder function's parameters include reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So setting lowerbound to current_timestamp - 86400 and upperbound to current_timestamp would get reminders due in the last 24 hours, which includes yesterday's time if the current time is within 24 hours. \n\nBut the user asked for \"yesterday,\" which is a specific day. Without knowing the current date, perhaps this is the best approximation possible. So proceed with that approach. \n\nTherefore, call the search_reminder function with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to current_timestamp - 86400 (which is 24 hours ago) and reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to current_timestamp. This will retrieve all reminders due in the past 24 hours, which the user refers to as \"yesterday.\" \n\nSo the arguments would be:\n\n{\n  \"reminder_timestamp_lowerbound\": 1755158761.108518,\n  \"reminder_timestamp_upperbound\": 1755245161.108518\n}\n\nBut since the user might have reminders set for other times, but the question is about \"yesterday,\" which is the day before today, this approach is acceptable given the available functions and the inability to get the exact date without additional steps. \n\nTherefore, the next tool call is to search_reminder with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_reminder\", \"arguments\": {\"reminder_timestamp_lowerbound\": 1755158761.108518, \"reminder_timestamp_upperbound\": 1755245161",
