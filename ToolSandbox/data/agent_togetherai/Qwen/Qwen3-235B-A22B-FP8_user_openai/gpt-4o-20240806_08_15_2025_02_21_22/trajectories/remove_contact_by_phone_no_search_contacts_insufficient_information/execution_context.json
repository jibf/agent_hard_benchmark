So, the problem is that the user doesn't have the necessary identifier.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a way to find the person_id using the phone number. But the available tools don't include a search function. The only function available is remove_contact, which needs person_id.\n\nSince the user can't provide person_id, I should inform them that the current tool can't help with just a phone number. Maybe suggest they need a different tool to look up the ID first. But since that's not available here, they might need to use another method or provide more information if possible. \n\nI should make sure not to assume any values or try to guess the person_id. It's important to be clear that without the ID, the removal can't proceed with the existing function. Offer help if they have another way to get the ID or if there's a different approach they can take. \n\nAlso, check if the user might have access to another system or tool where they can find the person_id linked to the phone number. If not, maybe they need to contact support or use a different service that allows searching by phone number. \n\nIn any case, the response should be helpful and guide the user towards the next steps they can take, given the limitations of the current tools available.\n</think>\n\nWithout the `person_id`, the `remove_contact` function cannot proceed, as it relies on this unique identifier to delete a contact. Since there’s no tool available here to search for a `person_id` by phone number, you’ll need to use another method (e.g., checking your contact database, app, or platform) to locate the `person_id` associated with `+12453344098` first.
