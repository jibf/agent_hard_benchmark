The available functions are for cellular, wifi, location status, sending messages (with number and content), and toggling cellular/wifi on/off. \n\nSince the user can't provide a phone number, sending a message isn't possible.

Alternatively, they might have a different request related to these functions. \n\nI should prompt them to ask if they need help with checking service statuses or enabling/disabling something.

I need to check if there's any function available that can help send a message without the number. The available functions include sending a message with a phone number, but that requires the number and content. Since the user doesn't have the number, I can't proceed with that. The other functions are for checking service statuses, which aren't relevant here. So, I should inform the user that without the phone number, sending the message isn't possible and maybe suggest they check if they can get the number through another means. But since the tools don't support looking up phone numbers, I can't help further. Need to make sure the response is clear and helpful, even though the answer isn't what they want.\n</think>\n\nI understand you'd like to send that message, but without having Fredrik Thordendal's phone number stored in your device or provided to me, I can't execute the `send_message_with_phone_number` function. The tools available don't include a way to look up or retrieve phone numbers. Would you like to store his number in your contacts first, or is there another way I can assist?",
