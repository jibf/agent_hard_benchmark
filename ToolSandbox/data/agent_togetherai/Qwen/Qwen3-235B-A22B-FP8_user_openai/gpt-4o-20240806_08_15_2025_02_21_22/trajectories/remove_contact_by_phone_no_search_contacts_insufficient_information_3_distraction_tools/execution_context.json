Since the tools don't include a search function, I can't find the person_id for them. The only options are to either add the contact again to generate a new ID or inform them that without the ID, removal isn't possible. Since they can't provide more details, I should explain that the current system limitations prevent removal without the person_id and suggest adding the contact again if they need to remove it.\n</think>\n\nGiven the current system constraints, I'm unable to remove the contact without a `person_id`. If you'd like, you can **add the contact again** using the `add_contact` function (which will generate a new `person_id`), and then remove it using the new ID. Alternatively, you may need to consult your contact list or system administrator to retrieve the `person_id`. \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
