    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. But wait, how do I know the date of next Friday? Since the user didn't specify a year or month, I should assume it's the upcoming Friday relative to today's date. However, to get the current date, I should call the get_current_timestamp function. That will give me the current time, which I can then use to calculate the next Friday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. If I can get the current date and time, I can find the next Friday. So first, get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to break it down into year, month, day, etc. Then, calculate the next Friday. For example, if today is Tuesday, next Friday is in 3 days. If today is Friday, then next Friday would be in 7 days.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a function to shift the timestamp. Wait, there's the shift_timestamp function that can add days, weeks, etc. But I need to know how many days to add. Alternatively, using the datetime_info to find the current day of the week, calculate how many days until next Friday.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that to datetime_info with timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current day of the week (isoweekday), where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7. So Friday is 5.\n3. Calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday. For example, if today is 3 (Wednesday), add 2 days. If today is 5 (Friday), add 7 days. The formula would be: (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. Wait, let's see: if current_day is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7) mod7 = 7 mod7 =0, so add 7 days. If current_day is 3 (Wednesday), (5-3) =2, so add 2 days. That works.\n4. Once the days to add are determined, use shift_timestamp to add those days to the current timestamp, setting the time to 17:00 (5 PM). Wait, but how to set the time? Because shifting by days only adds days, but the time part is preserved. Wait, no. For example, if the current time is 10 AM, shifting by 2 days will still have 10 AM. So after shifting, we need to adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Because shifting days might not be enough. Alternatively, after getting the next Friday's date, we can set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime_info to get current day of week.\n- Calculate days until next Friday: (5 - current_day +7) %7. If result is 0, add 7 days (since that would be same day, Friday, so next Friday).\n- Add those days to current timestamp using shift_timestamp with days=days_to_add.\n- Then, set the time to 17:00:00. But how? Because shift_timestamp can't adjust hours directly unless we shift by days and then add hours. Wait, maybe we need to create a new datetime with the date of next Friday, and time 17:00.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the date for next Friday, we can take that date and create a new timestamp with year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0. But how to get that timestamp? The functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, isoweekday.\n3. Calculate days_to_add to get to next Friday as mentioned.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, which gives a new date (but time is same as current). Let's call this shifted_ts.\n5. Convert shifted_ts to datetime_info to get the year, month, day of next Friday.\n6. Then, create a new timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nWait, but step 4's shifted_ts might not be necessary. Because if we can calculate the next Friday's date, perhaps we can directly construct that date and set the time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after determining the date of next Friday (without time), we can set the time to 5 PM.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on current_ts to get current date info.\n- Calculate days_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7. If days_to_add is 0, add 7 days.\n- Add days_to_add to current date to get next Friday's date.\n- Then, create a new timestamp for that date at 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to add days_to_add to the current date? Because the functions available don't include adding days directly. Wait, there's shift_timestamp which can add days. For example, shift_timestamp with timestamp=current_ts and days=days_to_add. That would give a new timestamp which is days_to_add days ahead. But the time part (hours, minutes, etc.) would be the same as the current time. Then, we can convert that timestamp to datetime_info to get the year, month, day. Then, create a new timestamp with that year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let's see. For example:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\ncurrent_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\ncurrent_day = current_info['isoweekday']\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7\nif days_to_add ==0:\n    days_to_add =7\nshifted_ts = shift_timestamp(timestamp=current_ts, days=days_to_add)\nshifted_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(shifted_ts)\nreminder_date = {\n    'year': shifted_info['year'],\n    'month': shifted_info['month'],\n    'day': shifted_info['day'],\n    'hour':17,\n    'minute':0,\n    'second':0\n}\nreminder_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(reminder_date)\n\nYes, that should work. Then, once we have reminder_ts, we can call add_reminder with content and reminder_timestamp=reminder_ts.\n\nBut wait, the user might not have provided content. The original query is \"Add a reminder next Friday 5PM\". The user didn't specify the content, so perhaps the assistant should ask for the content? But the instructions say to call the function if possible. However, the add_reminder function requires 'content' and 'reminder_timestamp' as required parameters. Since the user didn't specify the content, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user for the content of the reminder.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" But if the user didn't specify the content, the function can't be called. So in this case, the assistant should ask for clarification on the content. However, the initial instructions say \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo in this case, the user's request is ambiguous because they didn't specify the content. Therefore, the assistant should ask for the content. But the user's message was \"Add a reminder next Friday 5PM\". Maybe the user expects the assistant to proceed with what's available, but the 'content' is required. Therefore, the correct approach is to ask the user to provide the content for the reminder.\n\nBut the example might not include that. Wait, looking back at the tools, the add_reminder function requires 'content' and 'reminder_timestamp'. Since the user didn't provide content, the assistant can't fill that in. Therefore, the assistant should ask for the content.\n\nHowever, in the problem's context, the assistant is supposed to generate a tool call if possible. If the user's request is missing required parameters, the assistant should ask for clarification. Therefore, the correct response here is to ask the user for the content of the reminder. But the original query might have been part of a conversation where the content is implied, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user's message is \"Add a reminder next Friday 5PM\". There's no content provided, so the assistant can't proceed with the add_reminder function. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking the user for the content of the reminder.\n\nBut the problem says that the assistant should call functions if possible, otherwise ask for clarification. So in this case, since the content is missing, the assistant must ask the user to provide it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer here is to ask the user for the content of the reminder. However, looking back at the example, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the functions it can call to compute the timestamp, even if the content isn't provided. But the add_reminder function requires content. Therefore, the assistant can't call add_reminder without the content. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user for the content.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the assistant's response. So the assistant should respond"
