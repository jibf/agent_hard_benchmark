So, I called the `get_current_timestamp` function, which gave me the current POSIX timestamp, 1755245305.48172. That's the starting point for checking reminders.\n\nNext, I used the `search_reminder` function with the `reminder_timestamp_lowerbound` set to the current timestamp. This would find all reminders scheduled from now onwards. However, the response came back empty, indicating there are no upcoming reminders.\n\nSince the search returned an empty list, I needed to inform the user that there are no reminders set for the future. The user might not have any reminders or might have set them all in the past. Without any data, the logical response is to state that there are no upcoming reminders and offer assistance in creating one if needed.\n\nI made sure the response was clear and helpful, providing a straightforward answer and an option to help further. That way, the user knows their current status and what they can do next.\n</think>\n\nYou don't have any upcoming reminders scheduled after the current time.

Then, when I searched for reminders before the current time, there were three. Let me look at these to see why they didn't show up initially.\n\nFirst reminder: 'Look for Company SF tickets' with a reminder_timestamp of 1755152477.87745. Converting that to a date, let's see. The current timestamp is 1755245305.48, so that's a few days ago. So that reminder was already past.\n\nSecond reminder: 'Buy tickets for Merrily next week' with timestamp 1755238817.87747. Let me calculate the difference. Current time minus that is about 6,000 seconds, which is roughly 1 hour and 40 minutes. So that reminder was earlier today.\n\nThird reminder: 'Buy a nice rich navy bathing dress' with a timestamp of 1755242477.877489. Current time is 1755245305.48. The difference here is about 2,827 seconds, which is around 47 minutes. So that reminder was 47 minutes ago.\n\nSo all three reminders have already occurred. The user might have set them in the past by mistake. When they asked for upcoming, there were none. The user thought they had one, so maybe they intended to set a future reminder but didn't. I should explain that these are past reminders and ask if they want to create a new one. Also, check if they need help modifying existing ones if they were set incorrectly.\n</think>\n\nYou have three reminders that were scheduled before the current time:\n\n1. **\"Look for Company SF tickets\"** (Set for ~3 days ago)\n2. **\"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\"** (Set for ~1h 40m ago)\n3. **\"Buy a nice rich navy bathing dress\"** (Set for ~47 minutes ago)\n\nWould you like to:\n- Modify one of these reminders to a future time?\n- Create a new reminder for a specific date/time?\n- Check details about any of these reminders?",

They're now considering creating a new one.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm their intention. They said, \"maybe I just need to create a new one,\" so the main action is to help them create a new reminder. But before jumping into that, maybe they need some guidance on what they can do. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there's 'add_reminder' which requires content and a reminder_timestamp. To use that, I need to get those details from the user. The user hasn't provided specifics yet, so I should prompt them for the content of the reminder and the time they want it set for. \n\nAlso, considering the previous interactions, the user might not be clear on how to specify the time. Maybe they need examples or help converting a date/time into the correct timestamp format. The 'datetime_info_to_timestamp' function can be useful here if they provide a date in a natural language format. \n\nAlternatively, the 'shift_timestamp' function could help if they want to set a reminder relative to the current time, like \"tomorrow at 10 AM.\" Since the current timestamp is 1755245305.48172 (which is August 15, 2025, 4:08 AM), adding a day would be shifting by 1 day. \n\nI should ask them for the content of the reminder and the desired time. If they need help figuring out the time, I can assist with converting a natural language time to a timestamp. Once they provide those details, I can call the 'add_reminder' function with the content and the calculated timestamp. \n\nSo the response should prompt them to provide the reminder content and the time they want it set for, offering examples to make it easier for them. That way, I can gather the necessary parameters to use the 'add_reminder' function effectively.\n</think>\n\nLet's create a new reminder! Please provide:\n1. **What you want to be reminded of** (e.g., \"Buy groceries\")\n2. **When you want to be reminded** (e.g., \"Tomorrow at 3 PM\" or \"In 2 hours\")\n\nI’ll handle converting the time to the correct format! 😊",

After further checks and converting the timestamp to a readable date, they realized the reminders were set for the same day but earlier times.\n\nNow, the user says, \"You know what, I'll sort it out later. Thanks anyway!\" They're indicating they don't want to deal with it right now. My role is to acknowledge their decision, offer help if needed later, and keep the interaction friendly. I should respond with a positive message, let them know I'm here when they need me, and maybe add a friendly emoji to keep the tone light. No need for any function calls here since they're postponing the action.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome! Feel free to reach out whenever you're ready to sort things out. Have a great day! 😊",
