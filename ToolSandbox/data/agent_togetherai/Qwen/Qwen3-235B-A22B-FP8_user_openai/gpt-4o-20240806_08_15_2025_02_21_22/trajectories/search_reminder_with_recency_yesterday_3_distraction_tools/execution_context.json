                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nFirst, there's the search_reminder function. It allows searching reminders based on various criteria like reminder_id, content, creation or reminder timestamps, and location. Since the user didn't specify any particular ID, content, or location, I should focus on the timestamp. They want reminders related to yesterday. But wait, does \"yesterday\" refer to when the reminder was created or when it was supposed to be reminded? The question says \"on my reminder yesterday,\" which might mean reminders that were triggered yesterday, so the reminder_timestamp.\n\nTo get yesterday's date, I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. But how do I get the current timestamp? There's a get_current_timestamp function. Once I have the current timestamp, I can shift it back by 24 hours to get yesterday's start and end times. Wait, maybe I should get the current timestamp, then subtract a day to get a timestamp for the same time yesterday. But since I need the entire day (midnight to midnight), maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, using the shift_timestamp function. Let's say I get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get yesterday's timestamp. But to get the lower and upper bounds for yesterday, I need to calculate the start of yesterday (midnight) and the end of yesterday (23:59:59). Hmm, maybe first get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then subtract a day, set the time to midnight, then convert back to timestamp for the lower bound. Then add 23:59:59 to get the upper bound. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, using shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago, but that's a specific point in time, not the whole day.\n\nWait, the user might mean reminders that were scheduled for any time during yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be between the start of yesterday (midnight) and the end of yesterday (just before midnight). So I need to calculate those two timestamps.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Subtract one day from that to get a timestamp for the same time yesterday.\n3. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n4. Set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound (start of yesterday).\n5. Convert that back to a timestamp.\n6. For the upper bound, set the time to 23:59:59 of that day and convert to timestamp.\n7. Use these two timestamps as the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound in the search_reminder function.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions? Let's see:\n\n- Use get_current_timestamp to get now.\n- Shift it back by 1 day using shift_timestamp with days=-1. This gives a timestamp for the same time yesterday.\n- Then, convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. This gives the date parts for yesterday.\n- Then, create two datetime info objects: one with hour, minute, second set to 0 (lower bound), and another set to 23,59,59 (upper bound).\n- Convert both datetime info objects to timestamps using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n- Then use those two timestamps in search_reminder for reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut wait, the shift_timestamp function gives me the same time yesterday. Then, converting to datetime info gives the date parts. Then, setting time to 00:00:00 would give the start of yesterday. Similarly, 23:59:59 would be the end. But how to construct those datetime info objects?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after getting the shifted timestamp (same time yesterday), subtract the hours, minutes, seconds to get to midnight. For example, if the shifted timestamp is at 3 PM yesterday, subtract 15 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds to get midnight. But that seems more complicated. Using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function would give the day, month, year, etc., so I can then set the time to 0 and create a new datetime info for the lower bound, and 23:59:59 for the upper.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() to get now_ts.\n2. Call shift_timestamp with now_ts and days=-1 to get yesterday_ts (same time as now, but yesterday).\n3. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with yesterday_ts to get the date parts (year, month, day, etc.).\n4. Modify the datetime info to set hour, minute, second to 0 for lower bound (start of day).\n5. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp on this modified info to get lowerbound.\n6. Modify the same datetime info to set hour=23, minute=59, second=59 for upper bound.\n7. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp again to get upperbound.\n8. Use these lower and upper bounds in search_reminder's reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut wait, step 3 gives the datetime info for yesterday at the same time as now. For example, if now is 3 PM today, then yesterday_ts is 3 PM yesterday. Then, converting that to datetime info gives year, month, day of yesterday, and then setting hour=0, etc., would give midnight of yesterday. That's correct. Similarly, upper bound would be 23:59:59 of that same day (yesterday). So this approach should work.\n\nSo I need to make several function calls:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp().\n\nThen shift by -1 day:\n\nCall shift_timestamp with timestamp=now_ts and days=-1.\n\nThen convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info:\n\nCall timestamp_to_datetime_info with timestamp=yesterday_ts.\n\nThen create lowerbound datetime info: same year, month, day, but hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nCall datetime_info_to_timestamp with that.\n\nSimilarly, upperbound: same year, month, day, but hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nCall datetime_info_to_timestamp again.\n\nThen use these two timestamps in search_reminder as reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nThis way, the search_reminder function will return all reminders scheduled between midnight and the end of yesterday.\n\nSo the tool calls would be:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp()\n2. shift_timestamp with days=-1\n3. timestamp_to_datetime_info\n4. datetime_info_to_timestamp for lower\n5. datetime_info_to_timestamp for upper\n6. search_reminder with the lower and upper bounds.\n\nNow, considering that each tool call must be done step by step, but the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, no, in this scenario, the assistant can chain the calls. However, in the initial response, the assistant must output the first necessary tool call. Since the user's question requires multiple steps, the assistant would start with the first function needed.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should return the tool calls in the order they are needed, each in a separate step. However, in this setup, the assistant must output all necessary tool calls in one go. Wait, no. The user's initial query is processed, and the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the response. Wait, looking at the example in the problem statement: each tool call is in a separate XML tag. So, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the response.\n\nBut how does the system handle this? For example, if the assistant needs to call get_current_timestamp first, then shift_timestamp, etc., each step must be called in order. So the assistant would output the first tool call (get_current_timestamp), then the system would execute it and provide the result, and then the assistant would proceed with the next step.\n\nBut in this case, since the assistant can't execute code, it has to plan the steps and make the necessary calls in sequence. However, the way the tools are structured, the assistant must output all the required tool calls in the correct order.\n\nWait, but according to the initial instructions, the assistant should return a json object with the function name and arguments within tool_call tags. So each step requires a separate tool call. However, in the current setup, the assistant must generate all necessary tool calls in the correct order.\n\nWait, but the user's message is processed once, and the assistant must generate the correct sequence of tool calls. But how? For example, in the example, maybe the assistant would first call get_current_timestamp, then based on that result, proceed with shifting, etc. But since the assistant can't know the actual values (like the current timestamp), it must generate the tool calls in the order they are needed.\n\nSo the assistant would need to generate the first tool call (get_current_timestamp), then the next step would be shift_timestamp, and so on. However, in the current setup, the assistant must output all necessary tool calls in one response. But that's not possible because each subsequent tool call depends on the result of the previous one. Therefore, the assistant must output one tool call at a time, and the system would execute it, then loop back with the result, allowing the assistant to proceed.\n\nBut given the current problem setup, the assistant's response should include all the necessary tool calls in the order they should be executed. However, the assistant can't know the results of the previous calls, so it must structure the tool calls in sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first call get_current_timestamp, then shift it, then convert, etc",

I followed the steps to calculate the timestamp for yesterday's start and end, then used the search_reminder function with those bounds. The response came back with one reminder: \"Look for Company SF tickets\". \n\nNow I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants to know what was on their reminder list for the previous day. Since there's only one entry, I should mention that specifically. I should include the content of the reminder and maybe the creation and reminder timestamps for context. Also, since the latitude and longitude are None, it means there was no location associated with it. I should note that as well.\n\nWait, the user might not need the technical details of the timestamps, so converting them to a readable date format could be helpful. Let me check the timestamps: 1754979677.877442 is the creation time, which is July 13, 2025, and the reminder was set for July 14, 2025, at 2:24:37 AM. But since the user asked for yesterday's reminders, the exact time might not be crucial unless they ask for more details. \n\nSo, the main point is to relay the content of the reminder. I'll state that the reminder was about looking for Company SF tickets, created on a specific date and set for yesterday. Also, mention that there were no location details. If the user wants more info, they can ask, but for now, this should answer their query.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder from yesterday was:  \n**\"Look for Company SF tickets\"**  \n\nThis reminder was created on July 13, 2025, and scheduled for July 14, 2025 (yesterday). No location was associated with this reminder. Let me know if you need further details!",
