The available functions include search_messages, which can look for messages based on various criteria. Since the user wants their most recent message, I should use search_messages with parameters that will find the latest message sent by them.\n\nWait, the search_messages function allows filtering by sender_person_id, sender_phone_number, etc. But the user hasn't provided their person ID or phone number. Hmm, maybe the system can infer the current user's details? But according to the function's parameters, those fields are for exact matching. Without knowing the sender's ID or number, how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the most recent message they sent, but the system doesn't have context about who \"I\" is unless the user has provided their details before. Since the user hasn't provided their sender information, maybe I need to ask for clarification. But the problem says not to assume values. So perhaps the function can be called with the necessary parameters if we can get the current timestamp and find messages around that time?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's \"most recent\" can be determined by the creation_timestamp_upperbound. If I set the upperbound to the current timestamp and leave lowerbound open, but without knowing the sender, how can we filter? The function requires at least one parameter to narrow down the search. But the required list is empty, so maybe we can call it with no parameters? But that would return all messages, which isn't efficient.\n\nWait, but the user says \"my most recent message\". The assistant might need to know who the user is. Since the sender_person_id or sender_phone_number are required for exact matching, and the user hasn't provided those, perhaps the assistant needs to ask for more information. However, the user might expect that the system knows the current user's identity. If the system has a way to get the current user's person ID or phone number, that would be needed. But according to the given tools, there's no function to get the current user's info. So maybe the assistant has to make an assumption or the user needs to provide their sender details.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the most recent message can be found by timestamp. If the user sent a message, it would have the latest timestamp. But without knowing the sender, the assistant can't filter. Therefore, the assistant needs to know the sender's ID or phone number. Since the user hasn't provided that, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct approach is to ask the user to provide their sender information, like their phone number or person ID, to proceed with the search.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve your most recent message, I need to search for messages sent by you. However, I don't have access to your sender information (e.g., your phone number or person ID). Please provide your phone number or person ID so I can look this up for you.",
