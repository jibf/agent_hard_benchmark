The response came back with a contact entry: Fredrik Thordendal, friend, not self. Since the phone number was exactly matched, this should be the correct contact. Now, I need to confirm that this is the contact the user wants to remove. But wait, the system doesn't have a delete function. So I should inform the user that I found the contact and ask if they want to proceed with deleting it. However, looking back at the tools provided, there's only a search_contacts function. There's no delete function available. So I can't actually remove it; I can only help them find it. Therefore, my response should let them know that the contact exists and suggest they can delete it through their app, or maybe they need further assistance. I should present the information clearly and check if they need anything else.\n</think>\n\nThe contact with the phone number +12453344098 is:\n- **Name:** Fredrik Thordendal\n- **Relationship:** Friend\n- **Is Self:** No\n\nSince I cannot directly modify contacts, you can manually delete this contact in your phone's contact app. Would you like help with anything else?",

I used the search_contacts function and found Fredrik Thordendal with that number. The response included his name, relationship as friend, and is_self as no. The user then said they don't have more info, so maybe they don't know the person's details beyond the number.\n\nSince the user wants to remove the contact but can't do it themselves, they might need guidance. But the system can't perform actions, so I should confirm if they need help with something else related. Maybe they need to know how to delete a contact in their specific phone app, but since I don't have that info, I should ask if they need further assistance. The key is to acknowledge their statement and offer help without assuming their next move.\n</think>\n\nSince you don't have additional details about this contact, I recommend checking your phone's contact list to verify the entry before deletion. If you'd like guidance on how to delete contacts in your specific device/OS, let me know! Otherwise, I can't perform actions on your device."
