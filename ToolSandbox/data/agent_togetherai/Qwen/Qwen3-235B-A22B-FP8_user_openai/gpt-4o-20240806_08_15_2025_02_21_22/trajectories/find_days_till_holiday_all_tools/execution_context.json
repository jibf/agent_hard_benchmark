                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how many days until Christmas Day. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the date of Christmas Day. Christmas is on December 25th every year. So if today's date is before December 25th, the number of days until Christmas would be the difference between today and December 25th. If it's after December 25th, then it would be the difference until next year's December 25th.\n\nBut wait, how do I get the current date? The available functions include get_current_timestamp, which gives the current POSIX timestamp. I can use that to find the current date. Then, I need to calculate the next occurrence of December 25th. \n\nLet me break it down step by step. \n\n1. Get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime information (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Determine if December 25th of the current year has already passed. If not, calculate the difference between today and December 25th. If it has passed, calculate the difference from January 1st of next year to December 25th, then add the days remaining in the current year.\n\nWait, but how to calculate the days between two dates? There's a function called timestamp_diff which calculates the difference between two timestamps in days and seconds. So I can create a timestamp for December 25th of the current year, then subtract the current timestamp from it. If the result is negative, then adjust to next year's date.\n\nBut to create the December 25th timestamp, I need to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n- Convert current_ts to datetime_info with timestamp_to_datetime_info, which gives current_year, current_month, current_day, etc.\n- Create a new datetime_info for December 25th of current_year. If the current date is before December 25th, then the target date is this year. Otherwise, it's next year.\n\nWait, but how to handle that? For example, if today is December 26th, then Christmas has passed, so we need December 25th next year.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Get current_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n2. Get current_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n3. Create a candidate_dt for December 25th of current_dt[\"year\"]:\n   - Set year = current_dt[\"year\"], month = 12, day = 25, hour=0, minute=0, second=0\n   - Convert this to a timestamp candidate_ts using datetime_info_to_timestamp\n4. Calculate the difference between candidate_ts and current_ts using timestamp_diff. If the difference in days is negative, then create candidate_dt for next year's December 25th (year +1), convert to candidate_ts, and calculate the difference again.\n\nWait, but the timestamp_diff function returns the difference in days and seconds. So if current_ts is after candidate_ts, the difference (candidate_ts - current_ts) would be negative. So I can check if the result is negative, then add one year to the candidate_dt and recalculate.\n\nAlternatively, if the current month is December and day >25, then the next Christmas is next year. Otherwise, it's this year.\n\nBut maybe using the timestamp_diff is more accurate. Let's proceed:\n\nAfter step 3, compute the difference between candidate_ts and current_ts. If the difference is negative, then increment the year by 1 and repeat.\n\nOnce I have the correct candidate_ts, compute the days between current_ts and candidate_ts.\n\nWait, no. The timestamp_diff function takes two timestamps, timestamp_0 and timestamp_1, and returns timestamp_1 - timestamp_0. So if candidate_ts is before current_ts, then the difference would be negative. So if the difference is negative, we need to take next year's date.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter step 3, compute the difference (candidate_ts - current_ts). If that's negative, then we need to set the year to current_year +1 and create the candidate_ts again. Then compute the difference again.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nAlternatively, after creating candidate_ts for this year's December 25th, check if it's less than current_ts. If yes, then add one year to the candidate date and re-calculate.\n\nOnce the correct candidate_ts is found (which is the next Christmas), compute the difference between candidate_ts and current_ts. The days part of that difference will be the number of days until Christmas.\n\nSo, the functions needed are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp (to create the candidate date)\n- timestamp_diff (to find the difference in days)\n\nBut how to handle the candidate date creation?\n\nLet me think through an example. Suppose current_dt is December 20, 2023. Then candidate_dt is December 25, 2023. The difference will be positive 5 days. So answer is 5 days.\n\nIf current_dt is December 26, 2023, then candidate_dt is December 25, 2023 (this year), which is 1 day before current_dt. So the difference is negative. Therefore, we need to set the year to 2024, create December 25, 2024, then compute the difference between that and current_dt (which would be 364 days, since 2024 is a leap year).\n\nWait, but how to calculate that? The functions should handle that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Get current_ts via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Get current_dt via timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts).\n3. Create candidate_dt with year = current_dt[\"year\"], month = 12, day =25, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Convert candidate_dt to candidate_ts via datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n5. Compute diff = timestamp_diff(candidate_ts, current_ts). The result will have days and seconds. If diff.days <0, then increment candidate_dt year by 1, convert to candidate_ts again, and compute diff again.\n6. The answer is diff.days if not negative, else after adjusting to next year.\n\nWait, but timestamp_diff returns timestamp_1 - timestamp_0. So in step 5, the parameters are timestamp_0 = current_ts, timestamp_1 = candidate_ts. The result is the difference between candidate_ts and current_ts. If candidate_ts is before current_ts, then the result is negative.\n\nSo, if the difference is negative, then we need to create the candidate_dt for next year (year +1), convert to candidate_ts, and then compute the difference again.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\ncandidate_dt = {\n    year: current_dt[\"year\"],\n    month: 12,\n    day:25,\n    hour:0,\n    minute:0,\n    second:0\n}\ncandidate_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(candidate_dt)\ndiff = timestamp_diff(timestamp_0=current_ts, timestamp_1=candidate_ts)\nif diff.days <0:\n    candidate_dt.year +=1\n    candidate_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(candidate_dt)\n    diff = timestamp_diff(timestamp_0=current_ts, timestamp_1=candidate_ts)\n# Now, diff.days is the days until next Christmas\n# Also need to check if the diff.days is correct, considering possible leap years, etc.\n\nWait, but the timestamp_diff function returns the difference in days and seconds. So if the difference is negative, we adjust the year and recalculate.\n\nThis should work regardless of the current date. For example, if it's December 26, 2023, the first candidate_ts is December 25, 2023 (which is 1 day earlier). The diff would be (25-26) = -1 day. So we increment the year to 2024, create the candidate date, then compute the difference. The difference would be (2024-12-25 minus 2023-12-26), which is 364 days (since 2024 is a leap year). Wait, but 2024 is a leap year, so February has 29 days, but the days between Dec 25, 2023 and Dec 25, 2024 is 366 days (since Feb 2024 has 29 days). Wait, maybe the functions handle that automatically.\n\nIn any case, the functions should calculate the correct difference. So the steps are:\n\n- Get current timestamp and convert to datetime info.\n- Create a candidate date for December 25th of the current year.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n- Compute the difference between current timestamp and candidate timestamp.\n- If the difference is negative (i.e., candidate is before current date), increment year by 1 and repeat.\n- The result is the days difference.\n\nOnce we have the days difference, we can present that as the number of days until Christmas.\n\nNow, considering the functions available, I need to implement these steps using the tool functions.\n\nBut how to structure the function calls. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current_ts to get current_dt.\n\nThen, create a candidate_dt with year=current_year, month=12, day=25, and other time fields as 0.\n\nThen, convert that to candidate_ts via datetime_info_to",
