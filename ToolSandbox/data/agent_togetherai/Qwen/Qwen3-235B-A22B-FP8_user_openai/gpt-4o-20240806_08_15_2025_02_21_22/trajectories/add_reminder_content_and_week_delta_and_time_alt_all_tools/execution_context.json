Let me see how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. The current timestamp was provided as 1755244494.418607, which is in seconds. Let me convert that to a date to understand the current day. \n\nUsing an epoch converter, 1755244494 corresponds to approximately July 17, 2025, 12:54 PM (since 1755244800 is 00:00:00 on July 18, 2025). Wait, maybe I should double-check that. The exact conversion might vary, but the user said \"tomorrow,\" so regardless of the current day, we need to add one day to the current date.\n\nThe get_current_timestamp gives the current time. To get tomorrow's 5 PM, I can use the shift_timestamp function. The parameters would be the current timestamp, add 1 day, and set the time to 17:00:00. But wait, shifting by days might not set the time exactly. Alternatively, after shifting by one day, I might need to adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds. However, the shift_timestamp function allows adding days and also specifying hours. Wait, the function's parameters are: timestamp, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. So to get tomorrow at 5 PM, I can take the current timestamp, add 1 day, and set hours to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0. Wait, no. Because the shift_timestamp adds the deltas to the existing timestamp. So if the current time is, say, 12:54 PM, adding 1 day and 5 hours would make it 5:54 PM tomorrow. Wait, no. Wait, the current timestamp is 1755244494.418607, which is July 17, 2025, 12:54:54.418607 UTC. So adding 1 day would make it July 18, 12:54:54.418607. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So the time needs to be adjusted to 17:00:00. So perhaps first shift by 1 day, then adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds. But how?\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current timestamp, calculate tomorrow's 5 PM. Let's think in steps. The current timestamp is T. Tomorrow's 5 PM would be T shifted by 1 day, then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But how to do that? Maybe using shift_timestamp with days=1, hours= (17 - current hour) and minutes= -current minute, seconds= -current second. Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, after shifting by one day, set the time to 17:00:00. But the shift_timestamp function doesn't allow setting specific time parts, only adding deltas. Hmm. Maybe another approach: convert the current timestamp to datetime info, add one day, set the hour to 17, then convert back to timestamp. But the available functions don't have a direct way to do that. The functions available are get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and others. Wait, the user might need to use shift_timestamp with days=1, and then adjust the time to 5 PM. For example, if the current time is 12:54 PM, then after adding 1 day and 4 hours and 6 minutes, that would make it 5:00 PM tomorrow. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 12:54 PM plus 4 hours is 4:54 PM, plus 6 minutes would be 5:00 PM. So days=1, hours=4, minutes=6. But this depends on the current time. But the user wants to schedule it for tomorrow at 5 PM regardless of the current time. So maybe the correct way is to shift the current timestamp by 1 day, then adjust the hours and minutes to reach 17:00. However, since the shift is additive, the user might need to calculate the difference between the current time and 17:00. Alternatively, perhaps the user can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. For example, take the current datetime info, add one day, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert that to a timestamp. But how?\n\nWait, the available functions include datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info. So steps could be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (already done: 1755244494.418607)\n2. Convert this to datetime info to get year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n3. Then, add one day to that date, set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n4. Convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to add one day? Because the datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires the components. So, for example, if the current date is July 17, 2025, day 17, then tomorrow is July 18. Then, create a new datetime with day=18, hour=17, minute=0, second=0. But need to handle month and year transitions, but assuming the current date is such that adding a day doesn't cross a month, but the function should handle that automatically.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get the current year, month, day, etc.\n- Then, create a new datetime info with day = day + 1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Then, pass this to datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's assistant can't do that calculation directly because it's a series of function calls. The assistant can't perform arithmetic on the datetime components unless the functions allow it. So perhaps the assistant should use the shift_timestamp function with days=1, hours= (17 - current_hour), minutes= (0 - current_minute), seconds= (0 - current_second). Wait, but that might not work if current_hour is more than 17. For example, if the current time is 8 PM, adding 1 day and subtracting 7 hours would take it to 1 day -7 hours? No, because shift_timestamp adds the deltas. So if current time is 8 PM, days=1 would add 24 hours, then hours=-7 would subtract 7 hours, resulting in 17 hours (5 PM) the next day. Wait, yes. Because 8 PM + 24 hours = 8 PM next day, then minus 7 hours is 1 PM next day. Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think: adding 1 day (24 hours) and then subtracting 7 hours would result in 24 -7 = 17 hours added. So 8 PM +17 hours = 1 PM next day. That's not right. So this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to shift by 1 day and then adjust the time to 17:00. But how? For example, if the current time is 12:54 PM, shifting by 1 day (24 hours) would make it 12:54 PM tomorrow. Then, adding 4 hours and 6 minutes would get to 5:00 PM. So days=1, hours=4, minutes=6. But this depends on the current time. So how can the assistant calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, the assistant can calculate the difference between the current time and 5 PM, then shift accordingly. But since the assistant can't perform calculations outside the functions, maybe the best approach is to shift by 1 day, then use the timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current hour, then adjust the hours, minutes, seconds to reach 17:00. However, since the assistant can't perform these calculations directly, perhaps the user needs to use another function.\n\nWait, the user wants to schedule a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM. The current timestamp is 1755244494.418607. Let me check what date that is. Let's convert it:\n\nThe epoch time 1755244800 corresponds to July 18, 2025, 00:00:00 UTC. So 1755244494.418607 is approximately July 17, 2025, 23:54:54.418 UTC. Wait, no. Wait, 1755244800 is July 18, 00:00:00. So subtracting 86400 seconds (a day) gives 1755158400 as July 17, 00:00:00. So 1755244494 is 1755158400 + 86400 seconds",
