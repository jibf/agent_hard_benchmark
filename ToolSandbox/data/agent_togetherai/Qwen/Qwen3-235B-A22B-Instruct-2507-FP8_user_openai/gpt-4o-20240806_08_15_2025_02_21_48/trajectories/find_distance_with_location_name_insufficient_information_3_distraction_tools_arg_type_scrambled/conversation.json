Open the map app on your phone (like Google Maps or Apple Maps).\n2. Tap on your current location (usually shown as a blue dot).\n3. Long-press to drop a pin or view the coordinates in the search bar.\n\nOnce you share those coordinates (e.g., 37.7865, -122.4096), I can calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge right away!"
