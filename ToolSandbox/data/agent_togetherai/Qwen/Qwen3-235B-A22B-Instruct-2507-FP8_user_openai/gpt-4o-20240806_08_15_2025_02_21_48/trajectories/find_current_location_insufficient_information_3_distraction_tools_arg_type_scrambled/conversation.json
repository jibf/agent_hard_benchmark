It will display your location with a blue circle.\n\nIf location services are enabled, these apps can show you exactly where you are.\n\n### On a Computer:\n- If you're on a laptop with GPS (rare), or connected to a phone via hotspot, you can visit [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) and click the **locate** button (a small arrow or dot in the bottom-right corner of the map).\n\n### No Access to Devices?\nIf you're physically somewhere and unsure of the location:\n- Look around for street signs, building names, or business names.\n- Ask someone nearby.\n- Note any visible landmarks.\n\nOnce you have *any* detail — even a business name or street sign — I can help you identify your location. Just let me know what you find!"
