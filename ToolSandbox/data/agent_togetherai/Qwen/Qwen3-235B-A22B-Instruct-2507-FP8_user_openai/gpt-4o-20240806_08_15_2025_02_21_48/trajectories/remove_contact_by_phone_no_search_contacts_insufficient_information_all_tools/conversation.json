However, I don't have a function to search contacts by phone number. \n\nSince I can't search for the person_id by phone number, I can't safely remove the contact without knowing the person_id. The remove_contact function requires the person_id parameter, not the phone number.\n\nI recommend you check your contacts app to find the person_id for this contact, or provide more information if you have it."

Using the wrong person_id could remove a different contact by mistake.\n\nUnfortunately, with the tools I have access to, I can't complete this task without the person_id. The system doesn't provide a way to look up a person_id from a phone number, which is a necessary step before removing a contact."

You're right that you'll likely need to check your contacts app directly to find and remove that number. Most phone contacts apps allow you to search by phone number and then delete the contact from there.\n\nIf you need help with anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to ask!"
