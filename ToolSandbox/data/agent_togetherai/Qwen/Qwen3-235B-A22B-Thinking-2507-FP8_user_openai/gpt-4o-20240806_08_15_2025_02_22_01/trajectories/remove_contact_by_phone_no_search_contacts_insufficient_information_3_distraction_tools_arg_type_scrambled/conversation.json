The other functions are add_contact and modify_contact, which don't seem relevant here.\n\nWait, the problem is that the remove_contact function needs the person_id, but the user only gave the phone number. So I can't directly use remove_contact without knowing the person_id. The system doesn't have a function to search contacts by phone number. \n\nHmm, so the user might not know the person_id. I need to ask for clarification. Maybe they can provide the person_id, or perhaps there's another way. But according to the tools provided, there's no search function. So the correct step is to inform the user that I need the person_id to remove the contact, since the phone number alone isn't sufficient with the available tools.\n</think>\n\nTo remove a contact, I need the unique `person_id` associated with the contact.

The problem is that the remove_contact function requires the person_id.\n\nFirst, I checked the available tools. There's add_contact, modify_contact, and remove_contact. None of them have a search function. So the system can't look up the person_id by phone number. \n\nThe user says they don't have the person_id, only the phone number. Since the tools don't allow searching, I can't retrieve the person_id automatically. The user might not have access to the person_id, maybe because they didn't save it or the interface doesn't show it.\n\nI need to inform them that without the person_id, I can't proceed. But maybe there's another way? Wait, the add_contact allows duplicates, so there could be multiple entries with the same phone number. But even then, each has a unique person_id. Without knowing which one, removing by phone isn't possible.\n\nSo the correct response is to explain that the person_id is necessary and since they don't have it, they might need to check their contact list to find the ID. But since the tools don't support search, I can't help further. Maybe suggest they look in their contacts app for the ID associated with that number.\n\nWait, the user might not know what person_id is. Maybe they think the phone number is enough. But according to the function specs, remove_contact needs person_id. So I have to stick to that. No assumptions, so I can't guess the ID. Must tell them it's required and they need to provide it.\n</think>\n\nThe system requires the `person_id` to remove a contact, and **no tool is available to search for contacts by phone number**. Since you only have the phone number (`+12453344098`) and no `person_id`, I cannot proceed with the deletion. \n\nYou’ll need to:\n1. Locate the `person_id` for this contact (e.g., via your contact list interface or database).\n2. Provide it here so I can execute the `remove_contact` function.\n\nWithout the `person_id`, the system cannot safely identify which contact to delete (especially if duplicates exist). Let me know if you find the ID!"
