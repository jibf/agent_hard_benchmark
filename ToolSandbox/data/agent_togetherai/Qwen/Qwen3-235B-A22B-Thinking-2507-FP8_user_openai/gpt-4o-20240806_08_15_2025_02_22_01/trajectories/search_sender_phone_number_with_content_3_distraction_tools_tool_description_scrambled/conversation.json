The response came back with a message where the content is \"Hey kid, you want some GPU?\". The sender_phone_number is '+18307976530'. \n\nWait, the user's question is about \"GPUs\" plural, but the message says \"GPU\" singular. But maybe it's a typo or shorthand. The search was fuzzy matched on content, so it still picked it up. The sender's phone number here is +18307976530. \n\nI should check if there are other messages, but the tool response only shows one result. So the answer should be that phone number. The user is asking for the phone number that asked, so the sender_phone_number from the result is the answer. No need for further tool calls since the data is already retrieved.\n</think>\n\nThe phone number that asked if you want some GPUs is **+18307976530**. This comes from the message with content: \"Hey kid, you want some GPU?\" (note: singular \"GPU\" in the message, but matches your query via fuzzy search).",

They confirmed they got the info and thanked me.\n\nNow, they might not need anything else, but maybe they want to take action. Since the message was a bit suspicious (asking about GPUs, which could be a scam), maybe they want to block the number or report it. But the user hasn't asked for that yet. They just said thanks, so probably they're done.\n\nI should check if there's any follow-up needed. The tools available include sending a message, but the user hasn't asked to reply. They might just be acknowledging the answer. Since they said \"Got it, thanks!\", it's likely a closing statement. My job here is to respond appropriately without assuming further actions. Maybe a simple friendly reply to confirm they're all set.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome! If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask. 😊"
