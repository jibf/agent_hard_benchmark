                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current time isn't given, I should probably get the current timestamp first. But wait, there's a function called get_current_timestamp. Maybe I should call that to know the current time, then calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but there's also a function datetime_info_to_timestamp which converts date and time into a POSIX timestamp. However, to use that, I need the exact year, month, day, hour, etc. Since the user said \"tomorrow\", I need to know today's date to compute tomorrow's date. So maybe first get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to find tomorrow's date.\n\nSo step 1: Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get today's date and time.\n\nThen, add one day to get tomorrow's date. Then set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user specified \"tomorrow 5PM\", so assuming 5 PM in the user's local time. But maybe the system handles timezones? Not sure, but the functions might assume UTC or the user's timezone. Hmm. But the problem says not to make assumptions, so maybe I need to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate the timestamp for tomorrow 5 PM without knowing the current time. But since \"tomorrow\" is relative, I need the current date.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, convert that to datetime info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date: if today is, say, 2023-10-05, then tomorrow is 2023-10-06. Then set hour=17 (5 PM), minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the POSIX timestamp for that time.\n\nOnce I have the reminder timestamp, I need the location: Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So I need to find the latitude and longitude for that address.\n\nSo next, use search_location_around_lat_lon. Wait, but the function requires a location string. The user said \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". So the location parameter would be \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But the function might need latitude and longitude, but the user didn't provide them. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon has parameters location (required), and optional latitude and longitude. If latitude and longitude are not provided, it defaults to current location. But in this case, the user is specifying a location, so maybe we need to search for that location's coordinates.\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon is for searching around a given lat/lon, but if lat/lon aren't provided, it uses current location. But here, we need to find the lat/lon of \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". So perhaps we should use search_location_around_lat_lon with location set to \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", and without providing lat/lon, so it searches generally. Wait, but the description says \"location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address.\" So providing \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" as the location should return the specific location's details, including its lat/lon.\n\nSo first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the latitude and longitude of that store.\n\nOnce we have the lat and lon, then we can set up the reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\", reminder_timestamp as calculated, and the lat/lon from the location search.\n\nBut wait, the add_reminder function requires content and reminder_timestamp. The lat and lon are optional parameters for add_reminder. Since the user specified \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", we should include the lat and lon of that location in the reminder.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to determine tomorrow's date.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to find tomorrow's date.\n3. Calculate the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n4. Search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get its lat/lon.\n5. Add the reminder with the calculated timestamp and the location's lat/lon.\n\nBut wait, the user might have multiple Whole Foods on Stevens Creek? Maybe, but the function will return the most relevant one, or the user might need to specify, but since the user didn't, we'll proceed with the first result.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that to get current date.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, tomorrow is 2023-10-06. Then set time to 17:00:00.\n\nThen convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". Depending on the current time, if it's already past 5PM today, \"tomorrow\" would still be the next day. But since the user says \"tomorrow\", it's safe to assume they mean the next day at 5PM, regardless of current time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Add one day to the date (handling month/year rollover if needed).\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert that datetime to timestamp (datetime_info_to_timestamp).\n\nBut the functions available don't have a way to add days, so we need to do the calculation manually. However, since the assistant can't perform calculations, it needs to use the provided functions. Wait, no—the assistant can process the data. Wait, the assistant is supposed to call the functions, but the actual calculation of tomorrow's date would need to be done by the assistant, but since the assistant is an AI, it can compute it. However, the problem states that the assistant should not make assumptions and should ask for clarification if ambiguous.\n\nWait, but the user's request is clear: \"tomorrow 5PM\". So the assistant needs to compute the exact timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut to do that, it needs the current date and time, which requires calling get_current_timestamp.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, once we have the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to get the current date.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date.\n\nBut since the assistant can't execute code, it has to instruct the system to do these steps via function calls.\n\nWait, the assistant's job is to decide which functions to call. So first, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current date components.\n\nThen, calculate tomorrow's date (e.g., day +1, handling month end, etc.), then set time to 17:00:00, then convert back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant can't do the calculation itself; it has to generate the correct parameters for the functions.\n\nWait, no—the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls. So the process would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the result to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Then, compute tomorrow's date (e.g., if today is 2023-10-05, tomorrow is 2023-10-06), set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values to get the reminder timestamp.\n5. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get lat/lon.\n6. Finally, call add_reminder with content, reminder_timestamp, and lat/lon.\n\nBut since each tool call is sequential, the assistant needs to make these calls one by one. However, the problem states that for each turn, the assistant can make multiple tool calls if needed, but in this case, the steps are dependent (e.g., need current timestamp before converting to datetime info).\n\nWait, the problem says: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nBut the user's message is a single request, so the assistant should figure out all necessary tool calls in sequence.\n\nHowever, in reality, some tool calls depend on the results of previous ones, so the assistant can't make all calls at once. But in this problem setup, the assistant is supposed to generate the next tool call(s) based on the user's input, assuming that previous tool calls have been executed.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\"\n\nSo perhaps in this case, the assistant needs to first get the current timestamp, then based on that, calculate the reminder time, then get the location, then add the reminder.\n\nBut since the assistant can't know the current timestamp without calling the function, the first step is to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nSo the first tool call should be get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, once that's done, the next step would be to convert that timestamp to datetime info, but since the problem is about generating the tool calls for the current turn, the assistant should only make the first necessary call.\n\nWait, but the user's request is to set a reminder for tomorrow 5PM at a specific location.
