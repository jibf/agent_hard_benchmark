                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"What's the reminder I created yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to find reminders created yesterday.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp to know what \"yesterday\" refers to. The utilities_2 function can get the current POSIX timestamp. Let me call that first.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday. Since \"yesterday\" would be 24 hours before now, but maybe the user means the entire day before today. Wait, but the exact time might matter. Let's think: if today is October 5th, then yesterday is October 4th. To get the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to get the current timestamp, then subtract 24 hours (or 1 day) to get the lower bound. But the user says \"created yesterday\", so the creation timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now) using utilities_2.\n2. Use utilities_7 to convert current timestamp to date parts (year, month, day, etc.) to find the start of yesterday.\nWait, but maybe easier to subtract 2 days and 1 day? Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, then use utilities_5 to subtract 1 day to get the start of yesterday? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf today is 2023-10-05 14:30:00, then yesterday is 2023-10-04. The start of yesterday is 2023-10-04 00:00:00, end is 2023-10-04 23:59:59.\n\nSo to get those timestamps:\n\n- Current timestamp (now) is, say, 1696523400 (example).\n- Subtract 1 day (86400 seconds) to get to the same time yesterday, but we need the start of the day.\n\nWait, maybe better to get the current date, then set the time to 00:00:00 for yesterday.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with utilities_2.\n2. Convert that timestamp to date parts using utilities_7. Let's say current date is 2023-10-05.\n3. Then yesterday's date is 2023-10-04.\n4. Convert 2023-10-04 00:00:00 to timestamp (lower bound).\n5. Convert 2023-10-04 23:59:59 to timestamp (upper bound).\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe:\n\n- Use utilities_7 on current timestamp to get year, month, day.\n- Subtract 1 from the day to get yesterday's date.\n- Then use utilities_1 to create timestamp for yesterday 00:00:00 (lower bound) and 23:59:59 (upper bound).\n\nWait, but if today is the first day of the month, subtracting 1 day would go to previous month. But utilities_1 should handle that correctly if we pass the correct date.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n2. Call utilities_7 on that timestamp to get current date parts (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Subtract 1 from the day to get yesterday's date. If day is 1, then month -1, and day set to last day of previous month, but maybe utilities_1 can handle that if we pass the correct values. Wait, but when creating the timestamp for yesterday 00:00:00, we can just take current year, month, day -1, but if day is 1, it would be previous month. However, utilities_1 expects valid date parts. So maybe better to use utilities_5 to subtract 1 day from current timestamp, then set time to 00:00:00.\n\nWait, another approach: get current timestamp, subtract 1 day (86400 seconds) to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago, but that's not exactly the start of yesterday. For example, if now is 10:00 AM today, 24 hours ago is 10:00 AM yesterday. But the user probably means the entire day of yesterday, so from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Subtract 1 day (using utilities_5 with days=-1) to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago.\n- Then, convert that timestamp to date parts (using utilities_7), and set the time to 00:00:00 for lower bound, and 23:59:59 for upper bound.\n\nWait, but maybe easier:\n\nLower bound: current timestamp minus 2 days (to get to the day before yesterday's start?), no. Wait, let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose today is 2023-10-05.\n\nWe want reminders created on 2023-10-04.\n\nSo lower bound is 2023-10-04 00:00:00, upper bound is 2023-10-04 23:59:59.\n\nTo get these timestamps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now) which is 2023-10-05 14:30:00.\n2. Subtract 1 day (24 hours) to get 2023-10-04 14:30:00.\n3. Then, take that timestamp and set the time to 00:00:00 for lower bound. How?\n\nAlternatively, take the current date, subtract 1 day to get yesterday's date, then create timestamp for 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 of that date.\n\nSo:\n\n- Current date parts: year, month, day from utilities_7 of current timestamp.\n- Yesterday's date: day = day -1. If day is 1, then month -1, day = 31 (but need to handle month changes, but maybe utilities_1 can handle invalid dates by rolling over? Not sure. Maybe safer to use timestamp shifting.)\n\nWait, perhaps use utilities_5 to subtract 1 day from current timestamp, then use utilities_7 to get the date parts of that timestamp, then set hour, minute, second to 0 for lower bound, and 23,59,59 for upper bound.\n\nWait, but if I subtract 1 day from current timestamp, that gives me the same time yesterday. For example, now is 14:30, subtract 1 day is 14:30 yesterday. To get the start of yesterday, I need to subtract the hours, minutes, seconds from that timestamp.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nLower bound = current timestamp - 1 day - (current hour * 3600 + current minute *60 + current second)\nUpper bound = lower bound + 86399 seconds (since 24*3600 -1 = 86399)\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now) via utilities_2.\n2. Convert now to date parts (year, month, day, hour, min, sec) via utilities_7.\n3. Compute lower bound timestamp as: utilities_1 with year, month, day-1, 0,0,0.\nWait, but if day is 1, day-1 would be 0, which is invalid. So need to handle month and year changes.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Subtract 1 day (using utilities_5 with days=-1) to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago.\n- Then, take that timestamp and set the time to 00:00:00 by converting to date parts, zeroing the time, then back to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\nCall utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n\nThen, call utilities_5 with timestamp=current, days=-1 to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago.\n\nThen, call utilities_7 on that timestamp to get its date parts (year, month, day, ...).\n\nThen, use utilities_1 to create timestamp for that year, month, day, 0,0,0 (lower bound).\n\nUpper bound would be lower bound + 86399 seconds (23:59:59).\n\nWait, but maybe upper bound is lower bound + 86400 seconds (next day's 00:00:00), then the upper bound for the search would be exclusive. But the function's creation_timestamp_upperbound is inclusive? The description says \"Upperbound of the POSIX timestamp\", so probably inclusive. So to cover the entire day, upperbound should be 23:59:59.\n\nAlternatively, set upperbound as lowerbound + 86400 -1.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, subtract 1 day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago.\n\nThen, convert that to date parts",
