                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for their todo from yesterday. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" refers to. The current timestamp was retrieved as 1755239405.770045, which converts to August 15, 2025, at 2:30:05 AM. So today is August 15, 2025. Therefore, yesterday would be August 14, 2025.\n\nNow, to find todos created yesterday, I need to set the creation timestamp bounds for August 14. But wait, the user might mean reminders set for yesterday. Wait, the question is \"What's my todo yesterday?\" which could mean either todos created yesterday or todos due yesterday. Hmm, ambiguous.\n\nBut typically, \"todo yesterday\" might refer to tasks that were due yesterday. However, sometimes people might refer to tasks they created yesterday. The user's exact phrasing is \"my todo yesterday,\" which is a bit unclear. Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe search_reminder function has parameters for creation_timestamp and reminder_timestamp. So I need to determine which one to use. If the user is asking for todos they had to do yesterday, that's the reminder timestamp. If it's todos created yesterday, it's creation timestamp.\n\nBut the user says \"What's my todo yesterday?\" which is more likely referring to tasks that were supposed to be done yesterday, so the reminder timestamp should be yesterday's date.\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday (August 14, 2025). Since the current date is August 15, 2025, yesterday is August 14.\n\nTo get the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's date in POSIX timestamps:\n\n- Start of yesterday: August 14, 2025, 00:00:00\n- End of yesterday: August 15, 2025, 00:00:00 (but since today is the 15th, the upper bound would be 23:59:59 on the 14th)\n\nWait, but POSIX timestamps are in seconds. So for August 14, 2025:\n\nLower bound: 2025-08-14 00:00:00 UTC\nUpper bound: 2025-08-15 00:00:00 UTC (exclusive), so up to 2025-08-14 23:59:59.999...\n\nBut how to calculate these timestamps?\n\nI can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. Let's get the timestamp for August 14, 00:00:00.\n\nSo, parameters for lower bound: year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound would be August 15, 00:00:00, which is the start of today. Wait, but the current date is August 15, so today's start is August 15, 00:00:00. But yesterday's end is August 14, 23:59:59. However, using the upper bound as August 15, 00:00:00 would include all times up to but not including that timestamp, which effectively covers the entire day of August 14.\n\nSo, to get the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound for yesterday, I need to calculate:\n\nlowerbound = timestamp for 2025-08-14 00:00:00\nupperbound = timestamp for 2025-08-15 00:00:00\n\nWait, but the user is asking for todos yesterday. If it's the reminder timestamp, then we need reminders set for yesterday's date. So the reminder should trigger between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 on August 14.\n\nTherefore, the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound is the timestamp for 2025-08-14 00:00:00, and upperbound is 2025-08-15 00:00:00.\n\nSo I need to call datetime_info_to_timestamp for both dates.\n\nFirst, for lower bound: 2025, 8, 14, 0, 0, 0.\n\nThen for upper bound: 2025, 8, 15, 0, 0, 0.\n\nWait, but the current date is August 15, so today's start is August 15, 00:00:00. So yes, upper bound for yesterday is today's start.\n\nSo I need to make two calls to datetime_info_to_timestamp: one for the start of yesterday and one for the start of today.\n\nWait, but the user's current timestamp was 2025-08-15 02:30:05, so today is the 15th.\n\nSo, first, get timestamp for 2025-08-14 00:00:00 (lowerbound)\nand 2025-08-15 00:00:00 (upperbound)\n\nTherefore, I need to call datetime_info_to_timestamp twice with those parameters.\n\nWait, but the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. Wait, in the previous steps, the assistant called get_current_timestamp, then timestamp_to_datetime_info. Now, the next step would be to calculate the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut since the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response, but according to the instructions, for each function call, return a json object within tool_call tags. So perhaps the assistant needs to make two separate calls to datetime_info_to_timestamp for the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for \"todo yesterday,\" which is likely the reminder timestamp. So the search_reminder function should be called with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to yesterday's start and end.\n\nTherefore, first, compute the lower bound timestamp for yesterday (2025-08-14 00:00:00) and upper bound (2025-08-15 00:00:00).\n\nSo first, call datetime_info_to_timestamp for 2025,8,14,0,0,0.\n\nThen call it again for 2025,8,15,0,0,0.\n\nOnce those timestamps are obtained, then call search_reminder with those as the reminder_timestamp bounds.\n\nBut since the assistant can only make one tool call per turn, but the user's last response was the datetime info for the current timestamp, now the assistant needs to proceed step by step.\n\nWait, the current state is that we have the current datetime as 2025-08-15 02:30:05.\n\nTo find yesterday's todos (assuming reminder timestamp), we need the start and end of yesterday.\n\nSo first, calculate the start of yesterday: 2025-08-14 00:00:00.\n\nTo get that timestamp, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, calculate the start of today (which is the end of yesterday): 2025-08-15 00:00:00.\n\nCall datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2025, month=8, day=15, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nOnce we have those two timestamps, we can call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those values.\n\nBut since the assistant can only make one tool call per response, the next step would be to first get the lower bound timestamp.\n\nWait, but the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. Wait, looking back at the instructions: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo if multiple function calls are needed, the assistant should output multiple tool_call blocks.\n\nBut in this case, to get the lower and upper bounds, two separate calls to datetime_info_to_timestamp are needed.\n\nSo the assistant should first call datetime_info_to_timestamp for the lower bound (yesterday's start), then another call for the upper bound (today's start).\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since we know today's start is August 15, 00:00:00, which is 24 hours before August 16, 00:00:00, but perhaps it's easier to calculate directly.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp to subtract one day, but that might not be precise because of timezones, but assuming UTC.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is 1755239405.770045, which is August 15, 2025, 02:30:05 UTC.\n\nTo get the start of yesterday (August 14, 00:00:00), we can subtract 2 days and ",
