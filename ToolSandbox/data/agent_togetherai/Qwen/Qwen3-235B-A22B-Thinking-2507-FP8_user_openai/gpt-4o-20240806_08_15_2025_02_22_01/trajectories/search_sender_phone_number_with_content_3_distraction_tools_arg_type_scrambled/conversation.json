The user asked, \"Which phone number asked me if I want some GPUs?\" So I need to figure out the phone number that sent that message.\n\nFirst, I used the search_messages function with the content \"GPU\" to find relevant messages. The response came back with one message. Let me check the details.\n\nThe message has sender_phone_number as '+18307976530' and the content is 'Hey kid, you want some GPU?'. The user is asking for the phone number that asked about GPUs, so this seems to match. \n\nWait, the user said \"GPUs\" plural, but the message says \"GPU\" singular. But since the search was fuzzy, it probably still matched. The function's description says content is fuzzy matched, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at the sender_phone_number field, it's '+18307976530'. The recipient_phone_number is the user's number, which is '+11233344455', but the question is about who asked, so the sender is the one we need.\n\nI should confirm there are no other messages, but the tool response only shows one entry. So the answer should be the sender's phone number here.\n</think>\n\nThe phone number that asked if you want some GPUs is **+18307976530**. This comes from the message with content: *\"Hey kid, you want some GPU?\"*.",

I found the phone number and shared it. Now they're thanking me, so it's probably a closing statement.\n\nI should make sure there are no follow-up questions. Since they said \"Got it,\" they likely have the information they needed. My response should be polite and offer further help if needed. Maybe say something like \"You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else.\" That's friendly and opens the door for more assistance without assuming anything else is required.\n\nNo functions need to be called here because the user isn't asking for another action. They're just thanking me, so a simple acknowledgment is sufficient. I should avoid adding extra info unless necessary. Keep it concise and positive.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome!
