Let me check the available tools to see how I can handle this.\n\nFirst, looking at the tools provided. There's send_message_with_phone_number, which requires a phone number and content. But the user didn't provide a phone number for Fredrik. Hmm, I don't have his contact info. The other tools are for checking or setting service statuses like cellular, location, or wifi. Those don't seem relevant here.\n\nWait, the user is asking me to send a message to Fredrik. But without a phone number, I can't use the send_message function. The function requires both phone_number and content. Since the user didn't specify the number, I can't proceed. I should ask for clarification. Maybe the user expects me to know Fredrik's number, but according to the instructions, I shouldn't make assumptions. So I need to point out that the phone number is missing and ask for it.\n</think>\n\nI need the phone number for Fredrik Thordendal to send this message. Could you please provide the correct phone number to use with the `send_message_with_phone_number` function?"

The user wants to ask Fredrik Thordendal about his new album, but they don't have his phone number.\n\nFirst, I checked the tools available. There's the send_message_with_phone_number function, which requires a phone number and content. But the user says they don't have the number. So I can't use that function without the number.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me look at the other tools. There's get_cellular_service_status, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, set_cellular_service_status, set_wifi_status. None of these seem related to retrieving a phone number. They're all about checking or setting service statuses.\n\nSo the problem is the user doesn't have the phone number, and none of the provided tools can help find it. The functions available can't look up contact information. The only way to send a message is if we have the number, which we don't.\n\nTherefore, I should inform the user that without the phone number, I can't send the message. Maybe suggest they check their contacts or another source for the number. Since the tools don't support getting the number, there's nothing else I can do here.\n</think>\n\nWithout the phone number for Fredrik Thordendal, I cannot use the `send_message_with_phone_number` function to deliver your message. This tool requires a valid phone number to operate, and none of the other available functions (cellular/wifi/location status checks) can retrieve contact information. Would you like me to help with something else that doesn't require a phone number?"
