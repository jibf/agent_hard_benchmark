                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"How many km to Golden Gate Bridge?\" So first, I need to figure out what they're really asking. They probably want to know the distance from their current location to the Golden Gate Bridge in kilometers.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's a function called search_location_around_lat_lon that can find a location based on a query, like a landmark. But to use that, I need the latitude and longitude of the Golden Gate Bridge. Wait, maybe first I need to get the current location of the user. The get_current_location function can provide that, but the user didn't specify their current location. However, the tools mention that if latitude and longitude aren't provided for search_location_around_lat_lon, it defaults to the current location.\n\nWait, the user's question is about the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, so I need two points: the user's current location and the bridge's coordinates. So first, I should get the current location using get_current_location. Then, I need to find the latitude and longitude of the Golden Gate Bridge. To do that, I can use search_location_around_lat_lon with the location parameter set to \"Golden Gate Bridge\". But wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function requires a location string, and it will return the address and coordinates. However, since the Golden Gate Bridge is a specific landmark, searching for it should give its coordinates.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get the user's current lat and lon.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" to get its coordinates.\n3. Then use calculate_lat_lon_distance with the two sets of coordinates to find the distance in km.\n\nBut the user didn't specify their current location, so step 1 is necessary. Let me check the tools again. The get_current_location function has no parameters, so I can call that first. Then, once I have the current lat/lon, I can search for the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates.\n\nWait, but the search_location_around_lat_lon function can take a location string and return the coordinates. So after getting the current location, I need to get the bridge's coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the search_lat_lon function can be used if I have the bridge's address, but I don't. So first, I need to find the bridge's coordinates via search_location_around_lat_lon.\n\nWait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function's description says it searches for a location around a given lat/lon, but if lat/lon aren't provided, it defaults to current. But in this case, we want the exact location of the Golden Gate Bridge, so maybe we don't need to specify a starting point. However, the function requires the 'location' parameter, which is the query string. So by setting location to \"Golden Gate Bridge\", the function should return the coordinates of the bridge itself, regardless of the current location. Wait, the description says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query...\" Hmm, maybe the function is meant to search for places near a given lat/lon, but if you just want the coordinates of a specific place, you might need to use it without specifying lat/lon, but the function requires 'location' as a parameter. Wait, the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon have 'location' as required, and lat/lon are optional, defaulting to current. So if I call it with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and no lat/lon, it would search around the current location for the Golden Gate Bridge, which might not be correct if the current location is far away. Wait, but the Golden Gate Bridge is a specific place, so maybe the function will return its actual coordinates regardless of the search area? Or does it only find places near the given lat/lon?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The function's description says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude\", so it's intended to find places near that point. But if the user is asking for the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, which is in San Francisco, but if the current location is, say, New York, then searching around current location for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" might not return anything. So perhaps the correct approach is to first get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge by some means, then get the current location, then compute the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used to find the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates by querying it directly, even without a specific lat/lon. But the function's parameters require 'location', and lat/lon are optional. If lat/lon are not provided, it defaults to current location, but if the current location is not near SF, it might not find the bridge. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another function. The search_lat_lon function takes lat and lon and returns the address. But we need the opposite: given a place name, get its lat/lon. That's what search_location_around_lat_lon is for, but it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the description of search_location_around_lat_lon: \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address.\"\n\nSo the 'location' parameter is the query, like \"Golden Gate Bridge\", and the lat/lon are the center of the search area. If we don't provide lat/lon, it uses current location. But if we want the actual coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a specific point, we need to search for it without restricting to a nearby area. However, the function might not work that way—it might only return results near the given lat/lon. So if the current location is not in SF, it might not find the bridge.\n\nThis is a problem. Maybe the correct approach is to first get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge by some other means. Wait, perhaps using search_location_around_lat_lon with a generic location, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates are known, but since the tools don't have a direct function to get coordinates from a place name, we have to use search_location_around_lat_lon. But to do that, we need to specify a location to search around. If we don't know where the bridge is, how can we search for it?\n\nWait, perhaps the function is designed such that even if you don't provide lat/lon, it can still find the place globally. Maybe the 'around' is a misnomer, and it's just a search for the location globally. The description says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude\", but maybe it's more like a search centered there, but if the location is a well-known landmark, it might still find it even if far away. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get user's current lat/lon.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and the current lat/lon. But if the user is not near SF, this might not return the bridge.\n3. If that doesn't work, maybe we need to first find the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge by another method, but the tools don't have a direct function for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used with a generic search, ignoring the current location. For example, if I call it with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and no lat/lon, but the function requires lat/lon to default to current. So if the user's current location is somewhere, but we need the bridge's coordinates, this might not work.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the intended approach is:\n\n- Get current location (lat0, lon0)\n- Search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" to get its lat1, lon1\n- Calculate distance between (lat0, lon0) and (lat1, lon1)\n\nBut to get lat1 and lon1, we need to use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\". However, without providing lat/lon, it uses current location, which might not be near SF, so the search might not find the bridge. But perhaps the function is smart enough to find the actual Golden Gate Bridge regardless of the search area. Maybe the 'around' is just for proximity ranking, but it can still find it globally.\n\nAssuming that, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get user's current coordinates.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" (without lat/lon, so it uses current location, but hopefully returns the actual bridge coordinates).\n3. From the search result, extract the bridge's lat and lon.\n4. Use calculate_lat_lon_distance with the two sets of coordinates.\n\nBut the problem is step 2: will search_location_around_lat_lon return the correct coordinates for the Golden Gate Bridge even if the current location is far away? The function's description isn't clear on that. It says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude\", which suggests it's limited to that area, but maybe for well-known places, it still returns them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Wait, the search_lat_lon function takes lat and lon and returns the address, but we need the reverse. So perhaps the only way to get the bridge's coordinates is via search_location_around_lat_lon.\n\nGiven the tools available, the assistant has to proceed with the assumption that searching for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" will return its coordinates, even if the current location is elsewhere.\n\nSo first, get current location. Then, search for Golden Gate Bridge to get",
