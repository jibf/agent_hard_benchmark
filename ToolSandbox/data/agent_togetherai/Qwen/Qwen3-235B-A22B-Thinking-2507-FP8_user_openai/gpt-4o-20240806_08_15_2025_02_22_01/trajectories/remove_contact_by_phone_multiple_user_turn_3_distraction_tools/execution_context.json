But the user didn't provide a person_id. They just said \"delete someone,\" which is vague.\n\nI need to ask for clarification. Without the person_id, I can't call the remove_contact function. Maybe they know the name or other details, but the function specifically needs the person_id. So I should prompt them to provide the person_id of the contact they want to delete. Let me check if there's another function that can help find the person_id. Oh, there's search_contacts. Maybe I should first search for the contact using name or other info to get the person_id.\n\nWait, the user's request is to delete, but they might not know the person_id. So the correct step is to first search for the contact they want to delete. But the user hasn't provided enough info yet. My job is to ask for the necessary details. Since remove_contact requires person_id, and the user didn't specify which contact, I need to ask them to provide either the person_id or some identifying information like name or phone number so I can search for it first.\n\nSo the response should be to request more details. Let me phrase it clearly: ask the user to provide the person_id or the name/phone number of the contact they wish to delete so I can look it up and then proceed with deletion.\n</think>\n\nTo delete a contact, I'll need the specific **person_id** of the contact you want to remove. Since you haven't provided this identifier yet, could you please:\n\n1. Share the **name** or **phone number** of the contact you'd like to delete, OR  \n2. Confirm the exact **person_id** (if you already know it)?\n\nThis helps me locate the correct entry before deletion. For example:  \n*\"Delete the contact named 'John Doe'\"* or *\"Remove contact with person_id 'c12345'\"*",
