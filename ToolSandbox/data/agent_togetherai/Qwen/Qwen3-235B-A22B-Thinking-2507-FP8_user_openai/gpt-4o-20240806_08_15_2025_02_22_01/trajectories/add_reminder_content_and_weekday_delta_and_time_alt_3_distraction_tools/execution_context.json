                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for next Friday 5 PM. Since the current date isn't specified, I should get the current timestamp to determine what \"next Friday\" means. So I'll use the get_current_timestamp function.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to calculate the exact date. Let's think: if today is, say, Tuesday, next Friday would be in 3 days. But without knowing the current day, I can't compute it directly. So the right approach is to get the current timestamp first, then figure out the next Friday.\n\nBut the tools available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, etc. Alternatively, maybe use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to find the current day of the week, then calculate how many days until next Friday.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday, even if today is Friday. So if today is Friday, next Friday would be 7 days later. If today is Saturday, next Friday is 6 days later, etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, isoweekday) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Calculate the days needed to reach next Friday. Since isoweekday is 1-7 (Monday to Sunday), Friday is 5. So if current isoweekday is d, then days_to_add = (5 - d + 7) % 7. If d is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7)%7=7%7=0, but we want next Friday, so maybe 7 days. Wait, (5 - d) mod 7. Let's see: if today is Friday (5), then (5 -5) =0, but next Friday is 7 days later, so days_to_add = 7. So maybe days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If current_day is 5, then (5-5 +7)=7, mod7=0, but we need 7. Hmm, maybe better to compute days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If current_day is 5, that gives 0, but we need 7. So perhaps if the result is 0, set to 7.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If it's 0, then 7 days. So yes.\n\nOnce we have days_to_add, then the target date is current date + days_to_add days, plus 5 PM (17:00).\n\nBut to get the exact timestamp, maybe use shift_timestamp. Wait, but first need to get current timestamp, then shift by days_to_add and set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days and then adjusting the hour and minute. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, after getting current datetime info, calculate the target date:\n\ncurrent_year, current_month, current_day, current_hour, etc.\n\nCompute days_to_add as above.\n\ntarget_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle month and year rollover. That's complicated. Maybe better to use the shift_timestamp function to add the days, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc. So:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, calculate days_to_add as (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If current_isoweekday is 5 (Friday), days_to_add is 7.\n\nThen, shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, 17 hours, and 0 minutes, 0 seconds? Wait, no. Because shifting by days_to_add days gets us to the correct day, but then we need to set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has a time component. So shifting by days_to_add days would give the same time on the next Friday. But the user wants 5 PM, regardless of current time.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (D).\n3. Calculate days_to_add to next Friday (as above).\n4. Create a new datetime: D's year, month, day + days_to_add, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut how to compute the new day, considering month rollover?\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, then adjust the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would set the date to next Friday, but the time would be the same as current. So if current time is 10 AM, shifting by days_to_add days would be next Friday 10 AM. Then we need to adjust to 5 PM, which is +7 hours.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Convert T to datetime info to find current isoweekday.\n- Calculate days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If 0, set to 7.\n- Shift T by days_to_add days, then +7 hours (if current hour is less than 17) or maybe not. Wait, no. Because shifting by days_to_add days gives the same time on next Friday. Then we need to set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? Maybe shift the timestamp by days_to_add days, then subtract the current hour, minute, second, and add 17 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe better to use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the calculated target date and time.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter getting current datetime info (D), compute target_day = D['day'] + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle if target_day exceeds the number of days in the month. However, without knowing the month's days, this is tricky. So perhaps the safer way is to use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days, then adjust the time.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So:\n\nFirst, shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days. Let's call this T1.\n\nThen, T1 has the same time as current. So to set it to 17:00, we need to adjust the hours.\n\nFor example, if current time is 10:00, T1 is next Friday 10:00. We need to add 7 hours to get to 17:00.\n\nBut if current time is 18:00, then next Friday 18:00 is after 17:00, so we need to subtract 23 hours (to get to 17:00 next day?), but that's not right. Wait, no. If the user says \"next Friday 5PM\", it's the next Friday at 5PM, regardless of current time.\n\nSo regardless of current time, the target is next Friday at 17:00:00.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Find the date of next Friday (midnight).\n2. Add 17 hours to that.\n\nBut how to get next Friday midnight.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n- Calculate days_to_add as before.\n- Create a new datetime with year, month, day = current + days_to_add, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut to compute the new day, we need to handle month and year changes. Since the tool datetime_info_to_timestamp requires year, month, day, etc., we need to calculate those.\n\nBut without knowing the current month's days, it's hard. So perhaps the best way is to use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days, then adjust the hour.\n\nWait, let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose today is Monday (isoweekday=1), current time is 2023-10-02 14:30:00.\n\nNext Friday is 2023-10-06.\n\ndays_to_add = (5 -1) =4.\n\nShift current timestamp by 4 days: 2023-10-06 14:30:00.\n\nBut we want 17:00:00, so we need to add 2 hours and 30 minutes? No, 14:30 to 17:00 is +2h30m.\n\nWait, no: 14:30 + 2h30m =17:00.\n\nSo shift by 4 days and +2h30m.\n\nBut how to calculate that delta.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting by days_to_add days, compute the difference between 17:00 and current time's hour/minute.\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse datetime_info_to_timestamp to create the target timestamp directly.\n\nWe need to find the date of next Friday at 17:00.\n\nTo do that:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime_info (D).\n3. Compute days_to_add = (5 - D['isoweekday'] + 7) % 7. If ",
