First, they didn't know the phone number, so I helped them search contacts using the name. Found the number +12453344098. Then the user provided the message content.\n\nTried to send the message, but got a ConnectionError because cellular service wasn't enabled. So I called set_cellular_service_status with on: true to enable it. The response was None, which probably means it worked. Then tried sending the message again, and got a UUID response 'd239c6ac-5d36-4dfa-8325-7bf14697c717', which is likely a message ID confirming it was sent.\n\nNow the user needs confirmation that the message went through. Since the second send attempt succeeded, I should inform them the message was sent successfully using the cellular service after enabling it. Also, maybe mention the message ID for reference.\n</think>\n\nYour message to Fredrik Thordendal has been successfully sent via cellular service! 📱\n\n**Message ID**: d239c6ac-5d36-4dfa-8325-7bf14697c717  \n**Content**: \"How's the new album coming along\"\n\nCellular service was automatically enabled to deliver this message.
