My first step was to try to get the location data using search_location_around_lat_lon with \"Grand Canyon\" as the location. But the response came back with a ConnectionError saying Wifi is not enabled.\n\nHmm, so the problem here is that the device doesn't have Wi-Fi on, which is probably needed to access location services or weather data. The user might not realize that their Wi-Fi needs to be enabled for this function to work. Let me check the available tools. There's a get_wifi_status function that can check if Wi-Fi is on. Maybe I should first check the Wi-Fi status to confirm it's off, then prompt the user to enable it.\n\nWait, the error message already says \"Wifi is not enabled\", so maybe the system already knows that. But the user might need to turn it on. The tools include set_wifi_status, which can enable Wi-Fi. So the next step is to ask the user if they want to enable Wi-Fi to proceed. But since the user is asking for the temperature, which requires internet access (probably via Wi-Fi or cellular), and if Wi-Fi is off, maybe cellular is also off? But the error specifically mentions Wi-Fi.\n\nWait, the error is a ConnectionError from the search_location_around_lat_lon function. That function might require internet to get location data. If Wi-Fi is off, maybe the device is using cellular, but perhaps cellular is also off? But the error says Wi-Fi is not enabled. Maybe the app is configured to use Wi-Fi only, or the user's settings have cellular data off.\n\nBut according to the tools, there's get_cellular_service_status and set_cellular_service_status. However, the immediate issue is Wi-Fi. The user needs to enable Wi-Fi to get the location data, which is necessary for the weather search.\n\nSo the correct action here is to inform the user that Wi-Fi is disabled and ask if they want to enable it. If they agree, call set_wifi_status with on: true. Then retry the location search, and then the weather search.\n\nBut the user's original request is about temperature, which would require the search_weather_around_lat_lon function. But first, we need the latitude and longitude of the Grand Canyon, which the search_location_around_lat_lon was trying to get. Since that failed due to Wi-Fi, enabling Wi-Fi is the prerequisite.\n\nSo the next step is to check if the user wants to enable Wi-Fi. Since the error message is clear, the assistant should respond by explaining the issue and offering to enable Wi-Fi.\n</think>\n\nThe request to check the temperature at the Grand Canyon failed because Wi-Fi is currently disabled on your device.

                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to check the current temperature at the Grand Canyon without using Wi-Fi. They mentioned they can't read Celsius, so maybe they want it in Fahrenheit.\n\nFirst, I checked the location using search_location_around_lat_lon for \"Grand Canyon\". But there was a ConnectionError because Wi-Fi is off. Then I checked cellular service status, which is True, so cellular data is available. But when I tried the location search again, it still failed with the same error. Wait, maybe the problem isn't cellular vs Wi-Fi but something else.\n\nWait, the error says \"Wifi is not enabled\". Even though cellular is on, maybe the app is trying to use Wi-Fi first. Maybe the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires internet, which could be via cellular. But the error message specifically mentions Wi-Fi. Maybe the device has cellular data enabled but the app isn't using it, or the function is hardcoded to check Wi-Fi.\n\nWait, the user tried to check temperature without Wi-Fi. So maybe the app needs internet, but if cellular is on, it should work. But the error says Wi-Fi is not enabled. Maybe the function is checking for Wi-Fi specifically, not cellular. So even if cellular is on, if Wi-Fi is off, the function fails. But the user wants to use cellular.\n\nWait, the get_cellular_service_status returned True, so cellular is on. But the search_location_around_lat_lon might require internet, which could be via cellular. However, the error message says \"Wifi is not enabled\", which might be a misleading error message. Maybe the function is checking for Wi-Fi status even though cellular is available.\n\nHmm, maybe the next step is to check if location services are enabled. The user checked get_location_service_status, which returned True, so location is on.\n\nWait, the problem is that the search_location_around_lat_lon function might need internet to get the location data. Even if cellular is on, maybe the function isn't using it. Or perhaps the error is a generic one.\n\nWait, the user's device has cellular service on (True), but when trying to search location, it's giving a Wi-Fi error. Maybe the app is configured to only use Wi-Fi for data, and even though cellular is on, the app isn't using it. Or maybe the error message is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the location search requires internet, which is available via cellular, but the function is incorrectly reporting a Wi-Fi error. Maybe the problem is that location services are on, but internet isn't available through cellular for some reason.\n\nWait, the user said \"Try using your tools to check the current temperature in the Grand Canyon, without Wi-Fi, if possible.\" So they want to use cellular if possible.\n\nBut the search_location_around_lat_lon function might need to get the latitude and longitude of the Grand Canyon, which requires internet. If Wi-Fi is off, but cellular is on, it should still work. But the error says \"Wifi is not enabled\", which might be a misreported error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires the device's current location, which needs location services, but to get the weather, it needs internet. So even if location services are on (which they are), without internet (Wi-Fi off and maybe cellular data not enabled for the app), it can't fetch the weather.\n\nWait, the user has cellular service on (True), so maybe the app should use cellular data. But the error says Wi-Fi is not enabled. Maybe the app is checking for Wi-Fi specifically and not using cellular. So perhaps the next step is to check if the device's cellular data is enabled for the app, but the tools don't have a function for that.\n\nWait, the tools have set_cellular_service_status, but the user didn't ask to enable it; they said \"without Wi-Fi, if possible\". Since cellular is already on (True), maybe the problem is that the location search function isn't using cellular data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function is trying to get the current location first, which requires location services (which are on), but then to get the weather, it needs internet. If internet is via cellular, but the function is not using it, maybe the error is misleading.\n\nWait, the user's error after trying search_location_around_lat_lon was \"ConnectionError: Wifi is not enabled\". So the function is checking for Wi-Fi specifically. Even if cellular is on, if Wi-Fi is off, the function fails. But the user wants to use cellular.\n\nSo maybe the correct approach is to first get the latitude and longitude of the Grand Canyon using another method that doesn't require internet? But the tools don't have a function for that. Wait, there's search_lat_lon, but that requires lat and lon as input to get address. Not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Grand Canyon's coordinates are known. For example, approximate lat and lon. But the user hasn't provided that. The function search_location_around_lat_lon needs the location name, but to get that, it might need internet to resolve the name to coordinates.\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon's description says: \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nSo if we don't provide lat and lon, it uses current location. But the user wants Grand Canyon, so we need to provide the location as \"Grand Canyon\", but to resolve that to coordinates, it might need internet.\n\nBut if the device has cellular data on, it should be able to connect. However, the error says Wi-Fi is not enabled, which might be a red herring. Maybe the function is incorrectly checking for Wi-Fi even when cellular is available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the location service is on, but to get the exact coordinates of \"Grand Canyon\", it needs internet, which is available via cellular, but the error message is wrong.\n\nWait, the user tried search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Grand Canyon\" twice, and both times got the Wi-Fi error. Even though cellular is on.\n\nHmm. Maybe the next step is to check if the device can get the current location (lat/lon) via GPS, which doesn't require internet, then use that to search weather.\n\nWait, the get_current_location function returns lat and lon. Let's try that. If location services are on (which they are, as per get_location_service_status True), then get_current_location might work without internet, using GPS.\n\nWait, but GPS typically doesn't require internet, but getting the address or location name might. However, the get_current_location function just returns lat and lon, which GPS can provide without internet.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Use get_current_location to get lat and lon (but that's the user's current location, not Grand Canyon).\n\nWait, but the user wants Grand Canyon's temperature. So need the lat and lon of Grand Canyon.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the user is at the Grand Canyon, so current location is there. But the user didn't say that.\n\nWait, the user said \"Current temp Grand Canyon.\" So they want the temperature at the Grand Canyon, not their current location.\n\nSo to get that, need the lat and lon of the Grand Canyon.\n\nBut how to get that without internet? Maybe the function search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Grand Canyon\" would resolve it, but that requires internet.\n\nBut the error says Wi-Fi is off. However, cellular is on, so maybe the function should use cellular data. But the error message is confusing.\n\nWait, the error message says \"ConnectionError: Wifi is not enabled\". Maybe the function is checking for Wi-Fi specifically, not considering cellular. So even if cellular is on, if Wi-Fi is off, it throws this error.\n\nIn that case, the solution would be to enable Wi-Fi, but the user said \"without Wi-Fi, if possible\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can use cellular data, but the error message is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Since the user has cellular service on, perhaps the next step is to proceed to search the weather using the lat and lon of the Grand Canyon, but we need to get those coordinates first.\n\nWait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function, when given a location name, uses the device's internet (cellular) to resolve it. But the error says Wi-Fi is not enabled, which might be a mistake in the error message.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the device's cellular data is not enabled for the app, even though cellular service is on.\n\nBut given the tools available, perhaps the next step is to try to get the lat and lon of the Grand Canyon using search_location_around_lat_lon, but since that's failing, maybe try to use another method.\n\nWait, there's a function search_lat_lon which takes lat and lon to get address, but we need the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user knows the approximate coordinates of the Grand Canyon. For example, Grand Canyon Village is around 36.0544° N, 112.1401° W.\n\nIf I assume those coordinates, then use search_weather_around_lat_lon with those lat and lon.\n\nBut the user didn't provide coordinates, so I shouldn't assume. However, the problem says \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nBut the user is asking for the temperature at the Grand Canyon, which is a well-known location. Maybe the system can handle \"Grand Canyon\" as a location string without needing exact coordinates, but the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires it.\n\nWait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function's description says the location is a surface form query, like a business name or address. So \"Grand Canyon\" should",

So I need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n\nFirst, I checked the location using search_location_around_lat_lon, which gave me the coordinates. Then, after enabling Wi-Fi (since the initial attempts failed due to Wi-Fi being off), I used search_weather_around_lat_lon with those coordinates. The response shows the current temperature is 12.2°C.\n\nNow, I need to convert 12.2°C to Fahrenheit. The formula is (°C × 9/5) + 32. Let me calculate that: (12.2 × 9/5) + 32 = (21.96) + 32 = 53.96°F. So approximately 54°F.\n\nThe user might also want to know the condition, which is 'Clear', and maybe other details like humidity or wind speed, but the main request was the temperature. Since they can't read Celsius, providing the Fahrenheit value is essential. I should present the converted temperature clearly and mention the condition for context.\n</think>\n\nThe current temperature at the Grand Canyon is **54°F** (12.2°C), with **Clear** conditions.  \n\n*(Note: Converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit as requested.
