                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So they want to know their to-do list from yesterday.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function can help here. The available functions include search_reminder, which is for reminders. Since a todo list might be stored as reminders, that's a possibility.\n\nLooking at the search_reminder function parameters: it allows searching by reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. To find reminders for yesterday, I need to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify any particular content, just \"todo yesterday.\" So I need to get all reminders that were set for yesterday's date.\n\nFirst, I need to determine yesterday's date in terms of timestamps. Let's assume the current date is known. However, since the system might not have real-time data, maybe I need to use the current timestamp from the system. But the functions don't include getting the current time directly. Wait, there's datetime_info_to_timestamp, but that requires specific date info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_reminder can use the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound to cover yesterday's entire day.\n\nTo calculate yesterday's start and end timestamps:\n\nAssuming today is 2023-10-05, yesterday is 2023-10-04. The lower bound would be 00:00:00 of 2023-10-04, and upper bound 23:59:59 of the same day.\n\nBut how to get those timestamps? The user hasn't provided current date, so maybe the system can use the current time. However, since I can't assume current time, perhaps the function needs to be called with the correct parameters once the timestamps are known.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function requires the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So I need to compute those values.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, how can I calculate yesterday's timestamps? Maybe the system has a way to get the current timestamp, but the available functions don't include that. Wait, there's timestamp_to_datetime_info, but that converts a timestamp to date info, not the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used if we know the current date. But since the user is asking about yesterday, we need to know today's date to compute yesterday's.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't provided. But the assistant can't assume the current date. So maybe the correct approach is to ask for clarification, but the instructions say not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if ambiguous.\n\nWait, the initial instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nIn this case, the user says \"yesterday,\" but without knowing the current date, the system can't determine what yesterday is. However, maybe the system has access to the current date through other means, but the available functions don't include getting the current timestamp. Wait, there's no function to get the current time, so the assistant can't compute yesterday's date without that info.\n\nWait, looking at the tools, there's no function to get the current timestamp. So the assistant can't determine what yesterday is. Therefore, the request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" is relative and the system doesn't have the context of the current date.\n\nBut the user is asking \"What's my todo yesterday?\" which implies that they expect the system to know what yesterday is. Maybe in the context of the application, the system does have access to the current date, but since the tools don't include a function to get the current time, perhaps the assistant needs to use another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the search_reminder function can be called with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to yesterday's range, but without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute those values. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user to clarify the date or confirm that the system can infer the current date.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant should not make assumptions and must ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. Since \"yesterday\" is relative and the system can't determine the exact date without knowing today's date, the request is ambiguous.\n\nWait, but maybe the system does have a way to get the current timestamp through other functions. Let me check the tools again.\n\nLooking at the tools: there's get_current_location, get_cellular_service_status, etc., but no function to get the current time. So the assistant can't determine the current date. Therefore, the user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" can't be translated into a specific date range without knowing today's date.\n\nThus, the correct response is to ask for clarification, such as asking the user to specify the date they're referring to, or confirm if they mean the day before the current system date (but since the system can't access current date, it's ambiguous).\n\nBut the problem says that if the request is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification. However, in the context of this exercise, the assistant is supposed to either call a function or ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"What's my todo yesterday?\" and the assistant needs to respond. Since the assistant can't determine yesterday's date without current date info, which isn't provided, the correct action is to ask for clarification.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"For each turn, you respond by either calling one or more functions... or if none of the functions can be used, or the request is ambiguous, respond with a clarification question.\"\n\nWait, the problem states: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" If the request is ambiguous, you should ask for clarification.\n\nSo in this case, since \"yesterday\" is ambiguous without knowing the current date, the assistant should respond with a clarification question.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any date, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to ask the user to specify the date they're referring to, or confirm that they mean the day before today (but since the system might not know today's date, it's unclear).\n\nWait, but maybe the system does have access to the current date implicitly. For example, in a real application, the system would know the current date, but in this problem, since there's no function to get the current timestamp, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the request is ambiguous.\n\nSo the assistant should respond with something like, \"To find your todos from yesterday, I need to know the current date. Could you please confirm what today's date is, or specify the date you're referring to?\"\n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, if the request is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification. Therefore, the correct action here is to not call any function and instead ask the user to clarify.\n</think>\n\nTo determine your todos from yesterday, I need to know the current date to calculate what \"yesterday\" refers to. Could you please confirm today's date, or specify the exact date you're asking about?",
