There's rapid_api_search_tools_1 for getting an address from lat/long, utilities_1 for converting datetime to POSIX timestamp, and utilities_7 for converting POSIX timestamp back to datetime components.\n\nHmm, the user's query is about temperature, but none of the tools seem to handle weather data. The available functions are for geolocation and timestamp conversions. The rapid_api_search_tools_1 is for address lookup based on coordinates, which isn't related to temperature. The utilities functions deal with date and time conversions.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to figure out the date of this Friday first? Like, if I can get the current date, calculate Friday's date, then maybe use some weather API. But the problem is, the tools provided don't include a weather API. The only APIs here are for geolocation and timestamp conversion.\n\nSo, without a weather function, I can't retrieve temperature data. The user might not realize that the necessary tool isn't available. I should inform them that I don't have access to weather information and can't answer that query with the current tools.\n\nLet me double-check the tools again. Rapid_api_search_tools_1 is for address from lat/long. Utilities_1 converts datetime to timestamp. Utilities_7 converts timestamp to datetime parts. None of these give weather data. So, I can't get temperature. Therefore, I need to tell the user I can't help with that request using the available functions.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to weather data or temperature information through the provided tools. The available functions only support:\n1. Geolocation address lookup (latitude/longitude to address)\n2. Date/time to POSIX timestamp conversion\n3. POSIX timestamp to date/time components conversion\n\nTo answer a temperature question, we would need a weather API tool which isn't available in the current toolkit.
