                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for that time.\n\nI should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But wait, to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, minute, second. The user said \"next Friday at 5PM\". So I need to determine what date next Friday is.\n\nHmm, but how do I calculate next Friday? Maybe I should get the current timestamp first using get_current_timestamp. Then, figure out how many days until next Friday. Wait, but the tools available don't have a function to calculate the next Friday directly. Let me check the tools again.\n\nThe tools have get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, timestamp_to_datetime_info, etc. So maybe the process is: get current timestamp, convert to datetime info to find the current day of the week, calculate how many days to next Friday, then shift the timestamp accordingly.\n\nWait, but the user said \"next Friday\". If today is Friday, does \"next Friday\" mean this Friday or the following one? Usually, \"next Friday\" would mean the upcoming Friday, so if today is Friday, it's in 7 days. But maybe the user means the next occurrence. Let's assume that.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that to datetime info to know the current day (isoweekday).\n3. Calculate the days needed to reach next Friday. For example, if today is Monday (1), next Friday is 4 days later. If today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later.\n4. Then shift the current timestamp by the calculated days and set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user specified 5 PM, so after finding the date of next Friday, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires all the date and time components. So maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get current date and day of week.\n- Determine the date of next Friday.\n- Set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that datetime info to a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to adjust the current timestamp to next Friday at 5 PM.\n\nLet me outline the steps more clearly.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current year, month, day, hour, etc., and isoweekday.\n\nisoweekday is 1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday. So Friday is 5.\n\nIf current isoweekday is 5 (Friday), then next Friday is 7 days later. If it's after Friday (say Saturday is 6, Sunday 7), then next Friday is (5 - current_day + 7) days later? Wait, let's think:\n\nSuppose today is Monday (1), next Friday is 4 days later (1 + 4 = 5).\n\nIf today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later (5 + 7 = 12, but modulo 7 would be 5 again, so 7 days).\n\nIf today is Saturday (6), next Friday is 6 days later (6 + 6 = 12, which is 5 mod 7).\n\nWait, the formula for days until next Friday is (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. Wait:\n\nIf current_day is 5 (Friday), (5 -5 +7) %7 =7%7=0, but we want 7 days. So maybe (5 - current_day) %7, but if it's 0, add 7.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_day | days_to_add\n1 (Mon) | 4 (Fri is day 5, 5-1=4)\n2 (Tue) | 3\n3 (Wed) | 2\n4 (Thu) |1\n5 (Fri) |7 (since next Friday is a week later)\n6 (Sat) |6 (5 -6 = -1, so -1 +7=6)\n7 (Sun) |5 (5-7= -2 +7=5)\n\nSo the formula is (5 - current_day +7) %7. If the result is 0, it's 7 days.\n\nWait, (5 - current_day) %7. For current_day=5: (0)%7=0, so 7 days.\n\nYes, so days_to_add = (5 - current_day +7) %7. If 0, then 7.\n\nWait, (5 - current_day) %7 gives:\n\ncurrent_day=5: 0 → 7 days\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6)= -1 → 6 mod7=6\n\ncurrent_day=7: (5-7)= -2 →5 mod7=5\n\ncurrent_day=1:4, etc.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If 0, days_to_add=7.\n\nSo once we have days_to_add, we need to shift the current timestamp by that many days, but also set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has the current time. So shifting by days_to_add days would bring us to the same time on next Friday. But the user wants 5 PM, not the current time.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T0).\n2. Convert T0 to datetime info (D0).\n3. Calculate days_to_add as above.\n4. Set the target date to D0's date + days_to_add days, but hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert that target datetime to timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting days_to_add days, adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to do that with the tools?\n\nThe shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So maybe:\n\n- Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, but then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would set the date to next Friday, but the time would be the same as current. So if current time is 10 AM, shifting by days_to_add days would be next Friday at 10 AM. But we need 5 PM.\n\nSo need to adjust the time component.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T0).\n- Convert to datetime info (D0).\n- Calculate days_to_add to reach next Friday.\n- Create a new datetime: D0's date + days_to_add days, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nTo create that new datetime, perhaps:\n\n- Use shift_timestamp on T0 by days_to_add days, then shift by (17 - current_hour) hours, but if current_hour is after 5 PM, maybe need to adjust.\n\nWait, no. Because days_to_add is calculated to get to the correct date, but the time needs to be set to 17:00:00 regardless of current time.\n\nSo better approach:\n\nOnce we have the target date (next Friday), set the time to 17:00:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T0) via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert T0 to datetime_info (D0) via timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Calculate days_to_add = (5 - D0.isoweekday +7) %7. If 0, set to 7.\nWait, D0.isoweekday is 1-7, Friday is 5.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - D0.isoweekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, days_to_add=7.\n\nWait, (5 - D0.isoweekday) %7. For D0.isoweekday=5, it's 0, so days_to_add=7.\n\nFor D0.isoweekday=6, (5-6)= -1 mod7=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - D0.isoweekday +7) %7.\n\nIf days_to_add ==0, days_to_add=7.\n\nWait, (5 - D0.isoweekday) %7 gives:\n\nFor D0.isoweekday=5: 0 → 7 days.\n\nFor D0.isoweekday=6: -1 mod7=6 →6 days.\n\nFor D0.isoweekday=7: -2 mod7=5 →5 days.\n\nFor D0.isoweekday=1:4 →4 days.\n\nYes.\n\nSo once days_to_add is calculated, the target date is D0's date + days_to_add days.\n\nThen, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo the target datetime is:\n\nyear = D0.year\n\nmonth = D0.month\n\nday = D0.day + days_to_add\n\nhour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut need to handle month/year rollover, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get T0.\n\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T0 to get D0.\n\n- Calculate days_to_add.\n\n- Then, create a new datetime_info with year=D0.year, month=D0.month, day=D0.day + days_to_add, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nWait, but D0.day + days_to_add might exceed the number of days in",
