There's a function called send_message_with_phone_number that requires phone_number and content.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't provide a phone number. The message says \"Send a message to Fredrik Thordendal\", but the tool needs a phone number. Hmm, the problem here is that the phone number isn't specified. The user might assume I know it, but according to the instructions, I shouldn't make assumptions. The tools require the phone_number parameter, which is mandatory.\n\nSo I need to ask for clarification. The user said \"Resolve any issue alone,\" but without the phone number, I can't proceed. The function can't be called without it. Therefore, I should inform the user that the phone number is missing and request it. Wait, but the user said \"Resolve any issue alone,\" which might mean I should handle it without asking. But the instructions also say to ask for clarification if ambiguous.\n\nWait, the initial instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\" So even though the user says \"Resolve any issue alone,\" the correct action is to ask for the missing phone number because it's required and not provided. The user might have forgotten to include it, so I need to clarify.\n</think>\n\nThe request to send a message requires a phone number, but none was provided. Please specify the phone number for Fredrik Thordendal so I can proceed."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to send a message to Fredrik Thordendal but doesn't have his phone number.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available tools. There's the send_message_with_phone_number function, which requires both phone_number and content. The user provided the content but not the phone number.\n\nThe user mentioned they don't have the phone number. So, without that, I can't use the send_message function. Maybe there's another tool to get the phone number? Let me check the tools again.\n\nLooking at the tools: get_cellular_service_status, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, set_cellular_service_status, set_wifi_status. None of these seem to retrieve contact information or phone numbers. The functions available are for checking or setting service statuses, not for accessing contact details.\n\nSo, the problem is that the necessary parameter (phone_number) is missing, and there's no tool to obtain it. The user can't provide it either. Therefore, it's impossible to send the message without the phone number.\n\nI should inform the user that without the phone number, the message can't be sent. Maybe suggest they check their contacts or another source for the number. Since the tools don't support fetching phone numbers, there's nothing else I can do here.\n</think>\n\nThe message cannot be sent because the required phone number for Fredrik Thordendal is missing, and there are no available tools to retrieve contact information. Please provide the phone number or check if it exists in your contacts."

But none of these help in retrieving a phone number. The user has already confirmed they don't have the number and can't get it. \n\nSince there's no function to look up contact information or retrieve phone numbers, the system can't proceed. The user is stuck because the necessary parameter (phone number) is missing and there's no way to obtain it through the provided tools. \n\nI should inform them that without the phone number, the message can't be sent, and there's no tool available to help find the number. Maybe suggest checking contacts or another method, but within the tool constraints, there's nothing else to do.\n</think>\n\nThe system cannot send the message without a valid phone number, and there are no available tools to retrieve contact information or resolve missing phone numbers. Since the required parameter (`phone_number`) is unavailable and cannot be inferred, the task cannot be completed with the current toolset. Consider verifying the contact details through another channel or updating your contacts database."
