                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" means in terms of timestamps. Since the system uses POSIX timestamps, I should get the current timestamp first. So I'll call get_current_timestamp to know the present time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday. That would be subtracting one day from the current time. But how? Maybe using shift_timestamp. Wait, the shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp and deltas like days. So if I take the current timestamp and shift it back by 1 day, that gives me the start of yesterday. But wait, does \"yesterday\" mean the entire day before today? So from 00:00:00 yesterday to 23:59:59 yesterday?\n\nHmm. Let me think. If today is October 5th, then yesterday is October 4th. To get the start of yesterday, I need to subtract 1 day from the current timestamp, but also set the time to 00:00:00. Wait, but maybe the user just means any reminder created within the last 24 hours before now? Or exactly the calendar day of yesterday.\n\nThe problem is the user says \"yesterday,\" which typically refers to the previous calendar day, not the last 24 hours. So I need to find reminders created between the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday.\n\nTo get the start of yesterday, I can take the current timestamp, shift it back by one day, then set the time to 00:00:00. But how to do that with the available tools?\n\nWait, maybe first get the current timestamp. Then, shift it back by one day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago. But that's not exactly the start of yesterday. For example, if it's 10 AM today, 24 hours ago is 10 AM yesterday. But the start of yesterday would be midnight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe convert the current timestamp to datetime info, subtract one day from the date, then convert back to timestamp for the start and end of that day.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Subtract one day from the date (but need to handle month/year changes, which might be complex).\n4. Then create the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's date.\n\nBut the tools available don't have a direct way to adjust dates. Wait, there's shift_timestamp which can shift by days. So maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T back by 1 day to get T-1d.\n- But that gives a timestamp 24 hours before now, which is not the start of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, to get the start of yesterday:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n- Subtract 1 from the day (handling month/year rollover if needed).\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0 for the lower bound.\n- Set to 23:59:59 for the upper bound.\n\nBut how to do this with the tools? The datetime_info_to_timestamp function can convert a date/time to timestamp. So:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info (to get current date).\n3. Subtract 1 day from the date (manually, but need to handle cases where day is 1, so month changes, etc. But maybe the shift_timestamp can help here? Wait, if I take the current timestamp and shift it back by 1 day, that gives a timestamp that's 24 hours earlier. But if I want the start of yesterday, maybe I need to set the time to 00:00:00 of yesterday.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T back by 1 day to get T1 = T - 86400 seconds (1 day).\n- Then, get the start of the day for T1. How? Convert T1 to datetime info, set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp. But the tools don't have a function to set time components. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's \"yesterday\" is any reminder created between 00:00:00 yesterday and 23:59:59 yesterday. To get those timestamps:\n\nLower bound: start of yesterday (midnight)\nUpper bound: end of yesterday (23:59:59)\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (current_date).\n3. Subtract 1 day from current_date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Create a timestamp for yesterday 00:00:00 (lower bound).\n5. Create a timestamp for yesterday 23:59:59 (upper bound).\n\nBut how to subtract 1 day from the date? The shift_timestamp function can shift by days. So:\n\n- Take current timestamp T.\n- Shift T back by 1 day to get T_yesterday (which is T - 86400).\n- Then, convert T_yesterday to datetime info, set hour, minute, second to 0, and convert back to timestamp for lower bound.\n- For upper bound, set to 23:59:59.\n\nWait, but shifting T back by 1 day gives a timestamp that's 24 hours before now, which may not align with the calendar day. For example, if it's 10 AM today, shifting back 1 day is 10 AM yesterday. To get midnight yesterday, perhaps:\n\n- Take current timestamp T.\n- Convert to datetime info (current_date).\n- Subtract 1 from the day (current_date.day - 1), handling month/year if needed.\n- Then, create a timestamp for that date at 00:00:00 (lower bound) and 23:59:59 (upper bound).\n\nBut the problem is that the tools don't have a function to manipulate the date components directly. The available functions are datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nSo here's a possible plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_time to get current_date_info (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Subtract 1 from the day in current_date_info. If day becomes 0, adjust month and year accordingly (but this requires handling, which the assistant has to do manually since there's no function for that).\n4. Then, create two datetime info objects: one for yesterday 00:00:00 and one for yesterday 23:59:59.\n5. Convert both to timestamps using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n6. Use those timestamps as lower and upper bounds for creation_timestamp in search_reminder.\n\nBut the assistant has to handle the date adjustment. However, since the assistant can't perform date math directly, it might need to use shift_timestamp to subtract days until it gets to the start of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T back by 1 day to get T1.\n- Convert T1 to datetime info, then set hour, minute, second to 0 to get start of yesterday.\n- Convert that datetime info to timestamp (lower bound).\n- Then, shift that lower bound by 23h59m59s to get upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to set the time to 00:00:00? Let's see.\n\nSuppose current_time is 1628758800 (which is 2021-08-12 12:00:00 UTC).\n\nShift back 1 day: 1628672400 (2021-08-11 12:00:00).\n\nConvert to datetime info: year=2021, month=8, day=11, hour=12, etc.\n\nSet hour, minute, second to 0: 2021-08-11 00:00:00.\n\nConvert that to timestamp: 1628640000.\n\nThen upper bound is 1628726399 (23:59:59).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Shift it back by 1 day (call shift_timestamp with days=-1? Wait, shift_timestamp's parameters: \"weeks\", \"days\", etc. So to subtract 1 day, days=-1? Wait, the description says \"Delta can be positive or negative.\" So shifting by days=-1 would subtract 1 day.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function: \"Shifts a POSIX timestamp by provided deltas. Delta can be positive or negative.\"\n\nSo to get 24 hours ago, call shift_timestamp with timestamp=current_time, days=-1.\n\nBut that gives a timestamp 24 hours before now, which is not the start of yesterday.\n\nBut to get the start of yesterday, perhaps:\n\n- Take current_time, shift back by 1 day to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n- Convert that to datetime info, set time to 00:00:00, convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current_time via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Shift current_time back by 1 day (days=-1) to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n3. Convert that shifted timestamp to datetime_info (",
