                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to convert \"next Friday at 5PM\" into a POSIX timestamp. But wait, the system might not know the current date, so I should check if there's a function to get the current timestamp. Oh, there's get_current_timestamp. But the user mentioned \"next Friday\", which depends on the current day.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But to do that, I need the exact year, month, day, hour, etc. So first, I need to determine what date \"next Friday\" refers to.\n\nLet me think: If today is, say, Monday, next Friday is 5 days later. But without knowing the current date, I can't calculate that. So I need the current timestamp to compute the next Friday.\n\nSo step 1: Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, using that timestamp, figure out when next Friday is. But how? Maybe use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current day of the week.\n\nWait, there's a function called timestamp_to_datetime_info which gives isoweekday (1-7, Monday is 1). So if I get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, find the current weekday, then calculate how many days until next Friday.\n\nFor example, if today is Wednesday (isoweekday 3), next Friday is 2 days later. If today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nBut the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday, not the same day if it's Friday. Wait, sometimes \"next Friday\" can be ambiguous. If today is Friday, does \"next Friday\" mean 7 days later or the same day? But typically, \"next Friday\" would be the following week's Friday if today is Friday.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe assume that \"next Friday\" is the next occurrence, which could be 0-6 days away.\n\nBut to compute that, I need the current date.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current weekday.\n\nThen calculate the days until next Friday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a function to shift the timestamp. The shift_timestamp function can add days. So if I know how many days to add, I can shift the current timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_holiday function isn't relevant here. Let's see.\n\nWait, the user is setting a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Determine the date of next Friday.\n\n3. Set the time to 5 PM on that date.\n\n4. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current year, month, day, isoweekday.\n\nSuppose current isoweekday is X (1=Mon, 7=Sun). Friday is 5. So if X <=5, days to add is 5 - X. If X >5, days to add is 5 - X +7.\n\nWait, example: if today is Thursday (4), days to Friday is 1. If today is Friday (5), days to next Friday is 7. If today is Saturday (6), days to next Friday is 6 (6 to 7 is 1, then 5 more days? Wait, 6 (Sat) to next Friday: Sat (6) + 6 days = next Fri (5). Because 6 +6=12, 12 mod7=5.\n\nYes, formula: days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) %7. If current_weekday is 5 (Friday), (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0, but we want 7 days, so maybe it's (5 - current_weekday) %7, but if result is 0, add 7.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_weekday (isoweekday) ranges 1-7.\n\nWe want the next Friday, which is 5.\n\nIf current_weekday <=5: days_to_add =5 - current_weekday.\n\nIf current_weekday >5: days_to_add =5 - current_weekday +7.\n\nSo for example:\n\ncurrent=3 (Wed), days=2.\n\ncurrent=5 (Fri), days=0? But user says \"next Friday\", which if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later. So maybe days_to_add should be 7 if current is Friday.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\", which typically means the upcoming Friday, so if today is Friday, it's 7 days later.\n\nSo formula: days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, then it's 7 days.\n\nWait, (5 - current_weekday) mod7. If current_weekday=5, (5-5)=0 mod7=0, so days_to_add=7.\n\nYes, because (5 -5 +7)=7, 7 mod7=0, but we want 7.\n\nWait, maybe days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, then it's 7, else the result.\n\nWait, let's compute for current_weekday=5:\n\n(5-5 +7)=7 mod7=0 → days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_weekday=6:\n\n(5-6 +7)=6 mod7=6 → days_to_add=6.\n\ncurrent_weekday=7 (Sun):\n\n(5-7 +7)=5 mod7=5 → days_to_add=5.\n\ncurrent_weekday=1 (Mon):\n\n(5-1 +7)=11 mod7=4 → 4 days.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo once I have days_to_add, then I need to add that many days, plus set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has a time component. So if today is Wednesday at 6 PM, and next Friday is 2 days later, but the user wants 5 PM, so we need to set the time to 17:00 on that day.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current date and time.\n\n3. Calculate days until next Friday.\n\n4. Add days_to_add days to current date.\n\n5. Set hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\n6. Convert that datetime to timestamp.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions?\n\nAvailable functions:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: gives current timestamp.\n\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info: converts timestamp to year, month, day, etc.\n\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts year, month, day, etc. to timestamp.\n\n- shift_timestamp: can shift by days, hours, etc.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime info (year, month, day, isoweekday, etc.)\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add as (5 - current_weekday +7) %7. If 0, set to 7.\n\nWait, but in code terms: days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) %7\n\nIf days_to_add ==0, then days_to_add=7.\n\nWait, (5 - current_weekday) %7 gives 0 when current_weekday=5, which would mean same day, but user wants next Friday, so it should be 7 days later.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0:\n\ndays_to_add =7\n\nelse:\n\ndays_to_add remains\n\nWait, example:\n\ncurrent_weekday=5 (Fri), (5-5)=0 → 0 %7=0 → days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_weekday=6 (Sat), (5-6)= -1 → -1 %7=6 → days_to_add=6.\n\ncurrent_weekday=4 (Thu), (5-4)=1 → 1%7=1 → days_to_add=1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0:\n\ndays_to_add=7\n\nNow, once we have days_to_add, we need to add that many days to the current date, but also set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has a time component. For example, if current time is Wednesday 10 AM, adding 2 days (to Friday) would get us to Friday 10 AM, but we need 5 PM.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Take the current date (year, month, day), add days_to_add days.\n\n- Set the time to 17:00:00.\n\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\nAfter getting current datetime info (year, month, day, ...):\n\nnew_day = day + days_to_add\n\nBut need to handle month and year rollover. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that if we provide the correct year, month, day.\n\nWait, but if adding days_to_add to the current day exceeds the days in the month, we need to adjust month and year. However, since we're using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, which takes year, month, day as parameters, we can let it handle the date calculation.\n\nWait, no. The user is providing the year, month, day, so if we just add days_to_add to the current day, it might not be",
