                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods. Let me check the tools available.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are related to reminders. Looking at the tools, there's add_reminder, modify_reminder, remove_reminder, and search_reminder. The user is adding a new reminder, so add_reminder is the right choice.\n\nThe parameters for add_reminder are content, reminder_timestamp, latitude, and longitude. The required ones are content and reminder_timestamp. The user didn't specify a time, so I need to ask for clarification. Wait, but maybe the user expects a default time? But the function requires reminder_timestamp. Since the user didn't mention when, I can't assume. The instructions say not to make assumptions, so I should ask for the time.\n\nWait, but maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for a specific time, like when they're at Whole Foods. But without a timestamp, the function can't be called. The problem is the user didn't provide a time. So I need to request more information. Let me check the user's message again: \"Add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods.\" No time mentioned.\n\nSo, according to the guidelines, if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. The required parameters for add_reminder include reminder_timestamp, which is a POSIX timestamp. Since the user didn't specify when, I can't generate that. Therefore, I should respond asking for the date and time for the reminder.\n\nWait, but maybe the location (Whole Foods) can be used to get latitude and longitude. However, the add_reminder function allows optional latitude and longitude. But to get those, I might need to search for Whole Foods' location. However, the user hasn't provided the specific location details. So maybe first, I need to find the latitude and longitude of Whole Foods near the user's current location or a specific address. But the user didn't specify which Whole Foods. Hmm.\n\nWait, the add_reminder function's parameters for latitude and longitude are optional. The main issue is the reminder_timestamp. Without a time, the function can't be called. So the critical missing info is the time. The location (Whole Foods) could be handled by maybe searching for the location's coordinates, but the user might just want the reminder content to include \"at Whole Foods\" without specific coordinates. However, the reminder's content is a string, so maybe the user just wants the text to say \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\", and the location coordinates are optional. But the required fields are content and reminder_timestamp.\n\nSo the main problem is the missing timestamp. Therefore, I need to ask the user when they want to be reminded. For example, \"When would you like to be reminded? Please provide the date and time.\"\n</think>\n\nTo add your reminder, I need to know the specific date and time you'd like to be reminded. Could you please provide when you want this reminder to trigger? (e.g., \"tomorrow at 3pm\", \"next Monday at 9am\", or a specific date/time)",

However, without knowing the current date, I can't compute the exact timestamp. Hmm. But the assistant might have access to the current time through the get_current_timestamp function. Let me check the tools available.\n\nYes, there's get_current_timestamp which returns the current POSIX timestamp. So first, I should get the current timestamp, then calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a function that converts date-time info to a timestamp. Looking at the tools, there's datetime_info_to_timestamp which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But to use that, I need to know the exact date for tomorrow.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then add 24 hours (but considering if 5 PM is before or after the current time). Wait, but \"tomorrow at 5 PM\" is a specific time. Let's think: if today is, say, October 5th, 2023, and current time is 10 AM, then tomorrow at 5 PM is October 6th, 5 PM. But if the current time is already past 5 PM today, then \"tomorrow\" would still be the next day at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\", which is unambiguous. So regardless of the current time, it's the next day at 17:00 (5 PM in 24-hour format).\n\nBut to convert that into a timestamp, I need to know the current date. So first, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then compute the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the assistant might not have the ability to perform calculations. So maybe the correct step is to first get the current timestamp, then use shift_timestamp to add 1 day and set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shift_timestamp can add days, but how to set the exact time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used by extracting the current date, adding one day, and setting the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nBut the problem is that the assistant can't do calculations on its own; it needs to use the provided functions. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Then, calculate tomorrow's date: if current day is, say, 5th, then tomorrow is 6th. But need to handle month and year changes.\n4. Then, set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n5. Convert that datetime info back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant can't do step 3 on its own; it needs to use functions. Wait, the functions available include shift_timestamp, which can add days. So maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift it by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=1), but that would give the same time tomorrow. However, the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, not the same time. So if the current time is 10 AM, shifting by 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by constructing the correct date. For example, take the current date, add one day, set hour to 17, etc.\n\nBut to do that, the assistant needs to know the current date components. So:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get year, month, day, hour, etc.\n3. Then, increment the day by 1 (handling month/year rollover), set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date-time info.\n\nBut the assistant can't perform the increment step itself; it has to use the shift_timestamp function. Wait, shift_timestamp can add days. So if we take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day, but then adjust the time to 5 PM. However, shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, which would set the time to the same hour as now, but the user wants 5 PM regardless of current time.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\", perhaps the assistant can assume that \"tomorrow\" is 24 hours from now, but adjusted to 5 PM. Wait, no. For example, if it's 6 PM today, then tomorrow at 5 PM is 23 hours from now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the current date, add one day, set the time to 17:00:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute that. Therefore, the assistant needs to first get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info, then adjust the date and time accordingly.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current_year, current_month, current_day, etc.\n3. Compute tomorrow's date: new_day = current_day + 1. If new_day exceeds the number of days in the month, adjust month and year accordingly. But the assistant can't do this calculation; it needs a function. However, the shift_timestamp function can handle this. So instead of manually adjusting, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to the current timestamp, but then set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp adds a delta to the timestamp. So if we take the current timestamp, add 1 day (86400 seconds), but that would give the same time tomorrow. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time, we need to:\n\n- Take the current timestamp.\n- Shift to the start of tomorrow (midnight), then add 17 hours.\n\nBut how to get the start of tomorrow? Maybe:\n\ncurrent_ts -> get current datetime info.\n\ntomorrow_midnight = datetime_info_to_timestamp with (current_year, current_month, current_day +1, 0, 0, 0)\n\nthen add 17 hours.\n\nBut again, the assistant can't compute current_day +1 without handling month/year changes. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Shift by 1 day to get same time tomorrow.\n3. Then shift to 5 PM by adjusting hours.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: if current time is 10 AM today, then same time tomorrow is 10 AM. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, we need to add 7 hours to the shifted timestamp.\n\nBut if current time is 6 PM today, same time tomorrow is 6 PM, which is after 5 PM, so we need to subtract 1 hour.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by taking the current date, adding 1 day, and setting the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut to do that, the assistant needs to know the current date components. So:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get year, month, day, etc.\n- Then, create a new datetime info where day = current_day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- But if current_day +1 exceeds the days in the month, it would roll over, but the assistant can't handle that, so it needs to use shift_timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to the current timestamp, then set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but how to set the time?\n\nAnother approach: The user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\". So regardless of current time, the reminder should be at 5 PM the next day.\n\nTo get that timestamp:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ntomorrow_5pm = (current_ts // 86400 + 1) * 86400 + 17*3600\n\nBut the assistant can't do arithmetic, so it needs to use functions.\n\nWait, there's the shift_timestamp function. Let's see:\n\nIf we take the current timestamp, and shift it by the number of days needed to reach tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the correct date.\n\nFor example, suppose today is 2023-10-05, current time is 10:00:00.\n\nTomorrow is 2023-10-06, 17:00:00.\n\nSo the assistant needs to get the current date, increment the day by 1,",
