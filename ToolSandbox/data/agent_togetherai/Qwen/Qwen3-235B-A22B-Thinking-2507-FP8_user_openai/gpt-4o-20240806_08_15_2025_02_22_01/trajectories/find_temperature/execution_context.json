But the user's message is just repeating the question without giving the needed info.\n\nI should check if there's any way to get the coordinates automatically, but the tool doesn't mention using IP-based geolocation.

But how would the system know the current location without the user providing it?\n\nWait, maybe the system can get the user's location through other means, but the function's parameters state that latitude and longitude are optional, defaulting to current. However, as an AI, I don't have access to the user's actual location unless they provide it. So the defaults might be a bit misleading here.
