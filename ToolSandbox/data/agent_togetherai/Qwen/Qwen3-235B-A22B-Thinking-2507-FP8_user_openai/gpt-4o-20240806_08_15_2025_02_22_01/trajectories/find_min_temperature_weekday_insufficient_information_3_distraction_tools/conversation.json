But wait, the user didn't specify a location. Temperature data would depend on where they are. However, looking at the tools provided, none of them seem to handle weather data. The available functions are for geolocation (search_lat_lon), converting datetime to timestamp, and timestamp to datetime info.\n\nHmm, the tools don't include a weather API or temperature lookup function. So I can't actually retrieve temperature data. My job is to check if any of the provided tools can help. Let me review the tools again.\n\nThe first tool, search_lat_lon, takes latitude and longitude to get an address. But the user didn't provide coordinates. The other tools are for datetime conversions. Maybe I need to figure out the date of this Friday to get a timestamp, but even then, without a weather function, I can't get temperature.\n\nWait, the user's question is about temperature, which isn't covered by any of the available functions. So I should inform them that I can't help with that request using the tools I have. I need to point out that none of the provided functions can retrieve temperature data. Let me check again to be sure.\n\nLooking at the tools: search_lat_lon, datetime_info_to_timestamp, timestamp_to_datetime_info. None of these relate to weather. So I can't answer the temperature question. I should respond that I don't have the capability to check temperatures and maybe suggest they provide location coordinates if they want an address lookup, but even that might not help with temperature.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to use the datetime functions to find out what day Friday is, but without knowing the current date, how can I determine \"this Friday\"? But even if I could get the timestamp for Friday, there's no function to get weather data. So the answer is that I can't assist with temperature queries. I need to state that clearly.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to weather data or temperature information through the provided tools. The available functions only support:\n1. Converting coordinates to addresses\n2. Converting between datetime and POSIX timestamps\n\nTo answer temperature questions, I would need access to a weather API, which isn't available in the current toolset. Would you like me to help with something that can be addressed using the available location/time conversion tools instead?"
