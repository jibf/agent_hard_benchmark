                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the todo item they made yesterday. So first, I need to figure out what date \"yesterday\" refers to. To do that, I should get the current timestamp.\n\nI'll call the get_current_timestamp function to find out the current time. Once I have that, I can calculate yesterday's date. But wait, the user might have created the reminder at any time yesterday, so I need to set a time range from the start of yesterday to the end of yesterday.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function allows using creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So I need to get the timestamp for the start of yesterday and the start of today. Let me think: if today is, say, October 5th, then yesterday is October 4th. The lower bound would be midnight of October 4th, and upper bound would be midnight of October 5th.\n\nBut to get those timestamps, I need to convert yesterday's date into a timestamp. So first, get the current timestamp. Then subtract one day to get yesterday's timestamp. But wait, the current timestamp might be in the middle of the day. To get the start of yesterday, I need to shift the current timestamp back by one day and then set the time to 00:00:00.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is: get current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, subtract one day, then set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound, and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. Wait, but the search function uses POSIX timestamps, which are in seconds. So for the lower bound, it's the timestamp of 00:00:00 yesterday, and upper bound is 23:59:59 yesterday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Subtract one day from today's date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Create a timestamp for 00:00:00 of yesterday (lower bound).\n5. Create a timestamp for 23:59:59 of yesterday (upper bound).\n6. Use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those values.\n\nWait, but how to get the start and end of yesterday. Let's see:\n\nSuppose current timestamp is T. To get yesterday's start:\n\n- Get current datetime info (year, month, day, etc.)\n- Subtract one day from the day. If it's the first day of the month, handle month/year changes.\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0 for lower bound.\n- For upper bound, set to 23:59:59.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, take current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago, but that might not align with the start of the day. For example, if it's 3 PM today, subtracting 24 hours would be 3 PM yesterday, but we want from midnight to midnight.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set time to 00:00:00 for today, then subtract one day to get yesterday's 00:00:00.\n- Then add 24 hours to get today's 00:00:00, which is the upper bound for yesterday.\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose today is October 5, 2023, 15:30:00.\n\nCurrent timestamp is T.\n\nTo get yesterday's start (October 4, 00:00:00), we can take T, convert to datetime, set time to 00:00:00, then subtract one day.\n\nSimilarly, yesterday's end is October 4, 23:59:59, which is the same as October 5, 00:00:00 minus one second.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info.\n3. Create a new datetime for today at 00:00:00 (T0).\n4. Subtract one day from T0 to get yesterday_start (Y0).\n5. yesterday_end is T0 (today's 00:00:00), so the upper bound is T0, but since we want up to 23:59:59, maybe Y0 + 86399 seconds (24*3600 -1).\n\nWait, but POSIX timestamps are in seconds. So the range for yesterday would be from Y0 (timestamp of 00:00:00 yesterday) to Y0 + 86400 -1 (23:59:59).\n\nAlternatively, upper bound can be T0 (today's 00:00:00), since the reminder creation timestamp is up to but not including today's start.\n\nBut the search_reminder function uses upperbound as inclusive? The description says \"Upperbound of the POSIX timestamp\", so it's up to and including that timestamp. So to get all reminders created yesterday, the lower bound is Y0 (00:00:00) and upper bound is Y0 + 86399 (23:59:59).\n\nSo how to compute Y0:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Convert T to datetime info (current_date).\n- Set current_date's time to 00:00:00 (today_start).\n- Subtract one day from today_start to get yesterday_start (Y0).\n- Then upper bound is Y0 + 86399.\n\nWait, but how to get today_start. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_date = timestamp_to_datetime_info(T)\ntoday_start = datetime_info_to_timestamp(current_date['year'], current_date['month'], current_date['day'], 0, 0, 0)\nyesterday_start = shift_timestamp(today_start, days=-1)\nyesterday_end = shift_timestamp(yesterday_start, seconds=86399)\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, take current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago, but that's not the start of the day. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Create a timestamp for today at 00:00:00 (T0).\n4. Subtract one day from T0 to get yesterday's 00:00:00 (Y0).\n5. Then, the upper bound is Y0 + 86400 -1 = Y0 + 86399.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T to get current datetime.\n- Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create T0 (today 00:00:00).\n- Use shift_timestamp on T0 with days=-1 to get Y0.\n- Then Y0 is the lower bound, and Y0 + 86399 is upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to compute Y0 + 86399. Since Y0 is a timestamp, adding 86399 seconds would give the end of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, Y0 + 86400 is today's 00:00:00, so subtract 1 second.\n\nSo Y0 + 86400 -1 = Y0 + 86399.\n\nSo the upper bound for creation_timestamp is Y0 + 86399.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T) via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert T to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Create T0 (today 00:00:00) using datetime_info_to_timestamp with today's date and time 00:00:00.\n4. Shift T0 back by 1 day to get Y0 (yesterday 00:00:00).\n5. Compute upper bound as Y0 + 86399.\n6. Call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound = Y0, upperbound = Y0 + 86399.\n\nWait, but the functions available include shift_timestamp, which can shift by days. So step 4 can be done by shifting T0 by days=-1.\n\nBut to get T0, we need to set the time to 00:00:00. So:\n\n- After getting current datetime info, take year, month, day, set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert to timestamp. That's T0.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current date and time.\n3. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day from step 2, and hour=0, minute=0, second=0 to get T0.\n4. Call shift_timestamp on T0 with days=-1 to get Y0.\n5. Compute Y0_upper = Y0 + 86399 (but how? Since shift_timestamp can add seconds, but maybe better to compute Y0_upper as shift_timestamp(Y0, seconds=86399)).\nWait, but the search_reminder function takes upperbound as",
