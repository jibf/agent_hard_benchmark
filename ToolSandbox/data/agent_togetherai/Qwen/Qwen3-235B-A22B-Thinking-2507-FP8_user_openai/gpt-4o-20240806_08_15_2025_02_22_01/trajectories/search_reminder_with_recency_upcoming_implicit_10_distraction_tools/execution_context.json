The user asked, \"What's on my todo later?\" So I first checked the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp, which gave me 1755251904.367196. Then I used search_reminder with a lower bound of that timestamp to find reminders set for later.\n\nThe response from search_reminder was an empty list, meaning there are no reminders scheduled after the current time. Now I need to tell the user that there's nothing on their todo list for later. I should make sure to phrase it clearly and maybe suggest adding a reminder if they need one. Let me check if there's any other function I should call, but since the search came back empty, probably not. Just need to inform them politely.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders scheduled after the current time. Would you like to add a new reminder?",

First, I checked the current timestamp and searched for reminders after that time, but got none. Then they mentioned it's odd, so I tried again.\n\nI got the current timestamp again, converted it to datetime info to see today's date. It's August 15, 2025. Then I calculated the start of the day (midnight) as 1755230400 and the end of the day as 1755316800 (which is midnight next day). Searched reminders between those times and found two.\n\nNow, I need to present these reminders to the user. The first one is \"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\" with a reminder time of 1755238856. Let me convert that timestamp to a readable time. Using the datetime_info_to_timestamp or maybe timestamp_to_datetime_info again. Wait, the reminder_timestamp is 1755238856. Let me check what time that is.\n\nWait, the start of the day was 1755230400 (midnight Aug 15), and 1755238856 minus 1755230400 is 8456 seconds. 8456 seconds is 2 hours, 20 minutes, 56 seconds. So 2:20:56 AM. But the user might not want to see seconds. Maybe round to minutes.\n\nThe second reminder is at 1755242516.257953. Subtract start of day: 1755242516 - 1755230400 = 12116 seconds. 12116 / 3600 = 3.365 hours, which is 3 hours 21 minutes 56 seconds, so around 3:22 AM.\n\nWait, but the user said \"today\", and the current time when they checked was 5:59 AM (from the timestamp_to_datetime_info result: hour 5). So both reminders are set for early morning today, which might have already passed if it's now 5:59 AM. Wait, the current timestamp was 1755251977.361343, which is 5:59:37 AM. The first reminder is at 2:20 AM, which is before now, so it's in the past. The second is at 3:22 AM, also past. But the user is asking \"what's on my todo later?\" which implies future tasks. However, when they first checked, they searched for reminders after current time (which was 5:59 AM), so reminders set for after that time. But in the second search, they looked for all of today, including past times.\n\nWait, the user thought they had something set for today, but when they first checked (searching after current time), there were none. But when they searched the entire day, there were two reminders, but both are in the past relative to the current time (5:59 AM). So those reminders would have already triggered, but maybe the user missed them.\n\nSo the response should list both reminders, note their times, and mention they might have already passed. Also, check if the user wants to reschedule or add new ones.\n</think>\n\nHere are your reminders set for today (August 15, 2025):\n\n1. **\"Buy tickets for Merrily next week\"**  \n   ⏰ Scheduled for **2:20 AM** (already passed - 3 hours 39 minutes ago)\n\n2. **\"Buy a nice rich navy bathing dress\"**  \n   📍 Near coordinates (37.3238, -122.0396)  \n   ⏰ Scheduled for **3:22 AM** (already passed - 2 hours 37 minutes ago)\n\nBoth reminders were set for early this morning and have already elapsed based on current time (5:59 AM). Would you like to:\n- Reschedule either reminder for later today?\n- Add a new reminder for upcoming tasks?",

Let me check the conversation history.\n\nEarlier, they were confused because they thought they had a reminder set for today, but the initial search showed none. Then after checking the current timestamp and converting dates, we found two reminders that had already passed. The user specifically mentioned the bathing dress reminder.\n\nNow they're saying \"Ah, there it is! The bathing dress reminder. Thanks!\" So they're acknowledging that they found it. They might just be confirming they saw it, but maybe they want to take action. Wait, the previous message listed both reminders as already passed. The user might want to reschedule the bathing dress reminder since it's already past due.\n\nBut the user hasn't explicitly asked for anything else. They just thanked me. My job is to respond appropriately. Since they found the reminder, maybe they need help rescheduling or setting a new one. But the user hasn't asked for that yet. The last message from me offered to reschedule or add a new reminder.\n\nThe user's response is positive, so maybe they just wanted confirmation. But to be helpful, I should ask if they want to take any action with the reminder. However, the user said \"Thanks!\" which might indicate they're done. But since the reminder is already past, maybe they need to know it's too late or if they can still act on it.\n\nWait, the reminder was set for 3:22 AM, and current time is 5:59 AM. It's already passed. So the reminder is overdue. The user might want to reschedule it. But the user hasn't asked, so I should prompt them if they want to do that. But the user's last message is just thanking, so maybe they're satisfied. However, as an assistant, I should check if they need further assistance.\n\nIn the previous response, I offered to reschedule or add a new reminder. The user's reply might be closing the conversation, but it's good practice to confirm if they need anything else. So the appropriate response is to acknowledge their thanks and offer further help.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome! Since the bathing dress reminder was set for early this morning (3:22 AM) and has already passed, would you like me to help reschedule it for a later time today or set a new reminder for another task? 😊",
