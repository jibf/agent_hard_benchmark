                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" refers to. Since the user is asking about reminders from yesterday, I need to determine the timestamp range for yesterday. To do that, I should get the current timestamp first. So I'll use the get_current_timestamp function. That will give me the current POSIX time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday. Let's say today is October 5th, 2023. Yesterday would be October 4th. To get the start of yesterday (midnight), I can take the current timestamp, shift it back by one day, and set the time to 00:00:00. Similarly, the end of yesterday would be just before midnight of today, so 23:59:59 on October 4th.\n\nWait, but how do I get the exact timestamps for the start and end of yesterday? Maybe I can use the current timestamp, shift it back by one day, then convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info to get the date, then set the time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59. Hmm, but the functions available include shift_timestamp and datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Shift the current timestamp back by one day to get a timestamp within yesterday.\n3. Convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info to get the year, month, day.\n4. Use those to create two timestamps: one for the start of yesterday (00:00:00) and one for the end (23:59:59).\n5. Use those timestamps as lower and upper bounds for the reminder_timestamp in the search_reminder function.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for reminders that were set for yesterday, right? Or reminders that were created yesterday? The question is a bit ambiguous. The user says \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which probably means reminders that are scheduled for yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be within yesterday's date.\n\nSo the key is to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp is between the start and end of yesterday.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp. Let's call that T.\n\nThen, calculate the start of yesterday: take T, shift back by 1 day, then set time to 00:00:00.\n\nSimilarly, end of yesterday is start of today minus 1 second, or start of yesterday plus 24 hours minus 1 second.\n\nBut how to compute that with the available functions.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago.\n\nBut that's not exactly the start of yesterday. For example, if it's 10 AM today, shifting back 1 day gives 10 AM yesterday. But we need midnight to midnight.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info to get today's date (year, month, day).\n3. Subtract 1 day from today's date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Create a timestamp for yesterday 00:00:00 and yesterday 23:59:59.\n5. Use those as the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut to do step 3, I need to get today's date, subtract a day, then convert that date to timestamps.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T to get today's date (year, month, day, etc.).\n- Subtract 1 from the day to get yesterday's date. But need to handle month/year rollover, but maybe the functions handle that? Wait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives the current date components, so if today is the 1st of the month, subtracting 1 day would go to the previous month. But since we're using the datetime info, we can adjust the day, and if it's less than 1, adjust month and year accordingly. However, the user might not expect me to handle that manually. Wait, but the functions available don't include date arithmetic beyond shifting timestamps. So perhaps a better way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T back by 1 day to get T_yesterday.\n- Convert T_yesterday to datetime info to get the date components for yesterday.\n- Then create two timestamps: one for 00:00:00 of that date, and 23:59:59.\n\nWait, but shifting back 1 day from current time gives a time that's 24 hours earlier, but not necessarily midnight. For example, if current time is 15:30, shifting back 1 day is 15:30 yesterday. So to get midnight of yesterday, perhaps:\n\nTake current timestamp, shift back by (current hour, current minute, current second) to get to midnight today, then shift back 1 day to get midnight yesterday.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on current timestamp to get today's date at 00:00:00.\n\nWait, here's a method:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (D), which gives year, month, day, hour, etc.\n3. Set hour, minute, second to 0 to get start of today.\n4. Shift that timestamp back by 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n5. Shift start of yesterday by 24 hours to get start of today, then subtract 1 second to get end of yesterday.\n\nBut how to do steps 3 and 4 with the available functions.\n\nWait, the function datetime_info_to_timestamp can convert a date (year, month, day, etc.) to a timestamp. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Convert T to datetime info (D).\n- Today's date is D.year, D.month, D.day.\n- Yesterday's date is D.year, D.month, D.day - 1 (but need to handle if day is 1, then month -1, etc. But maybe the user's system handles that, but since we're using the functions, perhaps it's better to shift the timestamp.)\n\nAlternative approach using shift_timestamp:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T back by (D.hour) hours, (D.minute) minutes, (D.second) seconds to get to midnight of today.\n- Then shift that timestamp back by 1 day to get midnight of yesterday.\n- Then shift midnight of yesterday by 24 hours to get midnight of today, then subtract 1 second for end of yesterday.\n\nBut how to get D.hour, D.minute, etc.?\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp → T.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T → gives current datetime components.\n3. Use those components to create a timestamp for midnight today: set hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n   - So call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day from step 2, and hour=0, minute=0, second=0 → T_midnight_today.\n4. Shift T_midnight_today back by 1 day → T_midnight_yesterday.\n5. Shift T_midnight_yesterday forward by 1 day minus 1 second → T_end_yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nWait, but shifting T_midnight_yesterday by 1 day would get to T_midnight_today. So T_end_yesterday is T_midnight_today - 1 second.\n\nBut how to compute T_midnight_today - 1 second.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- T_midnight_yesterday = T_midnight_today - 86400 seconds (1 day).\n- T_end_yesterday = T_midnight_yesterday + 86399 seconds (23h59m59s).\n\nBut perhaps using shift_timestamp:\n\n- T_midnight_yesterday = shift_timestamp(T_midnight_today, days=-1)\n- T_end_yesterday = shift_timestamp(T_midnight_yesterday, days=1, seconds=-1)\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, hours, etc.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info to get today's date.\n\nCreate midnight today timestamp.\n\nShift back 1 day for midnight yesterday.\n\nShift midnight yesterday forward 1 day and subtract 1 second for end of yesterday.\n\nThen use those two timestamps as the lower and upper bounds for reminder_timestamp.\n\nSo the steps would require multiple function calls.\n\nLet me outline the required function calls:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp to get today's date components.\n3. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with today's year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0 to get midnight today.\n4. Call shift_timestamp on midnight today with days=-1 to get midnight yesterday.\n5. Call shift_timestamp on midnight yesterday with days=1, seconds=-1 to get end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n6. Use midnight yesterday as lowerbound and end of yesterday as upperbound for reminder_timestamp in search_reminder.\n\nBut the user's question is about reminders that are scheduled for yesterday, so the reminder_timestamp should be between midnight yesterday and 23:59:59 yesterday.\n\nSo the search_reminder function needs reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to those two values.\n\nBut to get those values, I need to compute them using the available functions.\n\nSo first, I need to get the current timestamp.\n\nThen",
