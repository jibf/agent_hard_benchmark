Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, I need to use the add_reminder function. It requires content and reminder_timestamp. The content here is \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\". But the timestamp is missing. The user didn't specify a time, so I need to ask for clarification. Wait, maybe they expect the reminder to be set for a specific time, but since it's not mentioned, perhaps they want it immediately or at a default time? But the function requires a POSIX timestamp. \n\nHmm, the parameters for add_reminder need a reminder_timestamp. Without a specific time from the user, I can't generate that timestamp. So I should ask the user when they want to be reminded. Alternatively, maybe the current time plus some default, but the function doesn't allow that. The user might have intended a specific time, but it's not provided. So the correct step is to request the time for the reminder. Let me check if there's another function to get the current timestamp. Yes, get_current_timestamp exists, but the user hasn't specified \"now\" as the time. They might want it for later. \n\nWait, the problem says not to make assumptions. So I can't assume they want it now. Therefore, I need to ask the user to specify the time they want the reminder. So the response should be a question asking for the time. But the user's instruction says if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. So in this case, the timestamp is required but not provided, so I need to ask the user when they want the reminder set.\n</think>\n\nTo set your reminder, I need to know when you'd like to be reminded.

The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods for tomorrow at 5pm.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for tomorrow at 5pm. Since the user didn't specify the time zone, I'll assume it's their current time zone. But to get the correct POSIX timestamp, I need the current date and time.\n\nWait, the tools available include get_current_timestamp, which gives the current POSIX timestamp. Maybe I should call that first to know the current time. Then, calculate tomorrow's date by adding 24 hours (86400 seconds) to the current timestamp. But wait, the user said \"tomorrow at 5pm\", so if today is, say, Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday at 5pm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But for that, I need the year, month, day, hour, minute, second. To get those, I might need to know the current date first. Let me check the tools again.\n\nThere's get_current_timestamp, which gives the current POSIX timestamp. Then, timestamp_to_datetime_info can convert that to year, month, etc. So first, get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info, then calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow at 5pm\". Let's break it down. Suppose today is October 5, 2023, 3pm. Then tomorrow at 5pm would be October 6, 2023, 17:00.\n\nSo steps needed:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to know today's date and time.\n2. Convert that to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, etc.)\n3. Add one day to the current date, set hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n4. Convert that datetime info to a POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the user might have specified \"tomorrow\" relative to their current time, so we need to calculate based on their current time.\n\nWait, but the user's message is \"I want it tomorrow at 5pm.\" So the assistant needs to determine the exact timestamp for that.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current date components. Then, add one day to the date, set hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0. Then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut the tools available are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: returns current POSIX timestamp.\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info: converts a timestamp to year, month, etc.\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts year, month, etc. to timestamp.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current date/time.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (handling month/year rollover if needed, but maybe the function handles that? Not sure, but as a simple approach, add 86400 seconds might be better, but the user said \"tomorrow at 5pm\", which is a specific time, not 24 hours from now. For example, if it's 6pm today, tomorrow at 5pm is 23 hours later.)\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the target datetime as today's date + 1 day, 17:00:00.\n\nSo using the current datetime info, set day = day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut need to handle if current time is past 5pm today. For example, if it's 6pm today, then tomorrow at 5pm is 23 hours from now. But the user said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5pm.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current datetime (year, month, day, hour, etc.)\n- If current hour is after 17 (5pm), then tomorrow is day +1, else same day +1?\nWait, no. \"Tomorrow\" is always the next calendar day. So regardless of current time, tomorrow at 5pm is the next day at 17:00.\n\nSo for example, if today is Monday, 10am, then tomorrow at 5pm is Tuesday 17:00.\n\nIf today is Monday, 6pm, then tomorrow at 5pm is Tuesday 17:00, which is 23 hours from now.\n\nSo the correct approach is to take current date, add 1 day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo to compute that:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info (current_year, current_month, current_day, ...)\n3. Create a new datetime: year=current_year, month=current_month, day=current_day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Convert that new datetime to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle cases where current_day +1 exceeds the number of days in the month, etc. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that correctly if the parameters are valid. So if current_day is 31 and month is January, adding 1 day would roll over to February 1.\n\nBut since the function requires valid date components, perhaps the assistant should calculate the correct date by adding 86400 seconds (24 hours) to the current timestamp, then set the time to 17:00:00 of that day.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Add 86400 seconds (24 hours) to get tomorrow's same time.\n- Then adjust the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's see.\n\nSuppose current timestamp is T.\n\nCompute T + 86400, which is 24 hours later.\n\nThen convert that to datetime info, set hour=17, minutes=0, seconds=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. For example, if current time is 3pm today, adding 24 hours gives 3pm tomorrow. Then setting hour to 17 (5pm) would be 2 hours later, so total 26 hours from now.\n\nBut the user wants exactly tomorrow at 5pm, which is 24 hours + 2 hours = 26 hours from 3pm today.\n\nAlternatively, take today's date, add 1 day, set time to 5pm.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ncurrent_date = today's date (from current timestamp)\n\ntarget_date = current_date + 1 day\n\ntarget_time = 17:00:00\n\nCombine them into a datetime, then convert to timestamp.\n\nTo do that, we need to get the current date components, increment day by 1, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current_year, current_month, current_day, current_hour, etc.\n3. Create new datetime: year=current_year, month=current_month, day=current_day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with these values to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nBut need to check if day+1 is valid. For example, if current_day is 31 and month is April (30 days), then day+1 would be 32, which is invalid. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that by rolling over to the next month. But since the function parameters require valid date components, perhaps the assistant needs to handle the date calculation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's safer to add 86400 seconds to the current timestamp, then adjust the time to 17:00:00 of that day.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nSuppose current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:00 (2:30pm).\n\nTomorrow at 5pm is 2023-10-06 17:00:00.\n\nCurrent timestamp is T.\n\nT + (3 hours + 30 minutes) = T + 12600 seconds would be 5pm today, but user wants tomorrow.\n\nWait, no. Tomorrow at 5pm is 24 hours + 2.5 hours = 26.5 hours from now.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute the timestamp for today at 5pm: if current time is before 5pm, then today at 5pm, else tomorrow at 5pm.\n\nBut the user said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5pm.\n\nSo, for example, if it's 6pm today, tomorrow at 5pm is 23 hours from now.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to take the current date, add one day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut to handle the date increment correctly, perhaps using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with day+1.\n\nHowever, if current_day is 31 and month is January, adding 1 day would make it 32, which is invalid",
