    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked how much 2048 USD is in CNY. I called the convert_currency function with the right parameters: amount 2048, from USD, to CNY. The response came back as 14705.152.\n\nNow I need to present this answer clearly. Let me check if the amount makes sense. Current exchange rates usually have 1 USD around 7.2 CNY, so 2048 * 7.2 is roughly 14745.6. The response is 14705.152, which is close, maybe the rate is slightly lower. That seems plausible.\n\nI should format the answer as \"2048 USD is equal to 14,705.15 CNY\" to two decimal places since currency conversions typically use two decimals. Wait, the response was 14705.152, so rounding to two decimals would be 14,705.15. But maybe the system expects three decimals? Wait, no, usually CNY uses two decimal places like most currencies. Let me confirm: the Chinese Yuan (CNY) is divided into jiao and fen, with 1 yuan = 10 jiao = 100 fen, so two decimal places are standard. So 14705.152 would round to 14,705.15 CNY.\n\nI should present it with a comma as a thousand separator for readability. So the final answer is 14,705.15 CNY. Let me make sure to state it clearly and mention the conversion rate if possible, but since the function response didn't give the rate, just the result, I'll just state the converted amount.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is equal to **14,705.15 CNY** (rounded to two decimal places)."
