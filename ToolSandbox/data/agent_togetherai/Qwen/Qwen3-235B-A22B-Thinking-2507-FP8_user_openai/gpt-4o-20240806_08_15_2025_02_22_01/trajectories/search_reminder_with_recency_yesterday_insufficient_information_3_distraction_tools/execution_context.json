Since the current date isn't provided, I might need to assume today's date, but the tools don't have a function to get the current time. Wait, maybe I can use the datetime functions to calculate yesterday's timestamp.\n\nThe user wants reminders from yesterday. So I need to search reminders where the reminder timestamp is within yesterday's date range. But to do that, I need the start and end timestamps for yesterday.\n\nLet me think. To get yesterday's start and end times, I need to calculate the POSIX timestamps for 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 of yesterday. But without knowing the current date, how can I compute that? Wait, maybe the system has access to the current time, but the tools provided don't include a function to get the current timestamp. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use the current date as the reference. Since the assistant can't know the current date without a function, but maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can help if I assume today's date. Wait, but the user didn't provide today's date. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to ask for clarification. But the problem says if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. However, the user is asking about \"yesterday,\" which is relative. Without knowing the current date, I can't determine yesterday's timestamp. So I need to ask the user to specify the date or confirm if they mean the day before today.\n\nWait, but the tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, etc. So perhaps I need to first get the current date, but there's no function for that. So maybe the assistant is supposed to assume the current date is known, but since it's not provided, this is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo in this case, the user says \"yesterday,\" but without knowing the current date, I can't compute the exact timestamps. Therefore, the request is ambiguous. I should ask for clarification, like asking the user to specify the date they're referring to or confirm if they mean the day before today.\n\nBut the user might expect the assistant to use the current system date. However, since the assistant doesn't have access to real-time data, it's ambiguous. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should ask for clarification instead of assuming.\n\nWait, but maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current date as known. However, the problem states not to make assumptions. So the correct action is to ask the user to clarify what date they consider as \"yesterday\" or provide the specific date range they're interested in.\n</think>\n\nTo search for reminders from \"yesterday,\" I need to determine the exact date range you're referring to. Since \"yesterday\" is relative to the current date, could you please clarify:\n\n1. Are you referring to the day before today's date (if so, I'll need to confirm today's date is known), OR  \n2. Would you like to specify a particular date (e.g., \"July 10, 2024\") instead of using \"yesterday\"?\n\nThis will help me accurately search your reminders.",

The user can't provide the current date, so maybe I should get the current timestamp from somewhere. Wait, the tools provided don't include a function to get the current time. The available functions are search_reminder, datetime_info_to_timestamp, shift_timestamp, timestamp_diff, timestamp_to_datetime_info, and unit_conversion.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function if I had a timestamp, but without knowing the current time, how do I get that? The problem is the user doesn't know the current date, so they can't tell me what yesterday is. But the system might have access to the current time. Wait, but in the context of this problem, the assistant doesn't have real-time data unless provided. The user is saying they don't know the current date, so maybe the system also doesn't have it. Wait, but in reality, the assistant would know the current date, but in this simulated scenario, perhaps we have to assume that we don't.\n\nWait, the user is saying they don't know the exact current date, so they can't say what yesterday is. So the assistant needs to figure out a way to determine yesterday's date without the user providing it. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the current system time. But in this problem, since it's a simulated environment, perhaps we need to use the tools to calculate it. Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can assume that \"yesterday\" refers to the day before the current system date. But since the user doesn't know the current date, the assistant might need to calculate it based on some reference. Wait, but without any input, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function. For example, if we can get the current timestamp, then subtract one day. But how to get the current timestamp?\n\nWait, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires year, month, day, etc. But if we don't know the current date, we can't use that. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, maybe the problem is that the user doesn't know the current date, but the system (the assistant) does. Wait, but in this scenario, the assistant is supposed to be a language model without real-time data. However, in some cases, the system might have access to the current time. But the user is stating they don't know the current date, so perhaps the assistant should proceed under the assumption that it can determine the current date.\n\nWait, but the user is saying \"I don't know the exact current date, so I can't say what yesterday is.\" So they are relying on the assistant to figure out what yesterday is. Therefore, the assistant needs to calculate yesterday's date based on the current date, which the assistant presumably knows.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, since it's a simulation, maybe the assistant should generate a tool call to get the current timestamp. However, looking at the tools provided, there's no function to get the current time. The available functions are for converting between datetime info and timestamps, shifting timestamps, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Without a timestamp, it can't do that. So maybe the assistant needs to assume a current timestamp. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a reference timestamp. Wait, but without knowing the current time, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant should ask for clarification, but the user already said they don't know the current date. So the assistant has to figure it out.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the current system time implicitly. For example, in real-world scenarios, the assistant would know the current date, so it can calculate yesterday. But in this problem, since it's a simulation, maybe we're supposed to proceed as if the assistant can determine the current date.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"I don't know the exact current date, so I can't say what yesterday is.\" So they are expecting the assistant to handle it. Therefore, the assistant should calculate yesterday's date based on the current date (which the assistant knows), then convert that to a timestamp range for the search.\n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? Since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume that it can generate the current timestamp. Wait, but the tools provided don't include a way to get the current time. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by inputting the current date. But how does the assistant know the current date? In a real system, the assistant would have access to the current time, but in this problem, since it's a simulation, perhaps we have to assume that the assistant can generate the current date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the assistant to use the shift_timestamp function with a delta of -1 day from the current time. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, how?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a hypothetical current timestamp, but that seems circular.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp. But since there's no function to get the current time, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the system's current time implicitly. However, in the context of the problem, the assistant must use the provided tools.\n\nWait, looking back at the tools, there's a function called timestamp_to_datetime_info which converts a timestamp to datetime info. But to use that, we need a timestamp. If the assistant could get the current timestamp, but there's no function for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume that the current timestamp is available. For example, in a real application, the backend would provide the current time, but here, since it's a simulation, maybe we can proceed by generating the current timestamp via the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by inputting the current date.\n\nBut how does the assistant know the current date? This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should use the shift_timestamp function with a delta of -1 day from the current time. But again, without the current timestamp, this isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the assistant to realize that without the current date, it can't determine yesterday, so it needs to ask for more information. But the user already said they don't know the current date. So the assistant has to find another way.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_diff function, but that requires two timestamps.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's think differently. The user wants reminders from yesterday. To search for that, the assistant needs to define a time range for yesterday. Yesterday is from midnight to midnight of the previous day.\n\nTo get that range, the assistant needs to calculate the start and end timestamps of yesterday.\n\nAssuming the assistant knows the current date (even though the user doesn't), it can compute yesterday's date.\n\nFor example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday is 2023-10-04, from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.\n\nTo convert that to POSIX timestamps, the assistant would need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp for the start and end times.\n\nBut how does the assistant get today's date? In a real system, it would have access to the current time, so it can calculate yesterday. Since the user doesn't know the current date, the assistant must handle it.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should:\n\n1. Determine the current date (using system time, which it has access to).\n2. Calculate yesterday's date.\n3. Convert yesterday's start and end times to POSIX timestamps.\n4. Use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those timestamps.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, since the assistant is a language model without real-time data, but the problem expects us to proceed as if it can, we need to simulate that.\n\nWait, but the tools don't include a way to get the current time. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used if we have the current date. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume it knows the current date.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can generate the current timestamp by using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But how does it know the current date?\n\nThis is a bit of a loop. Maybe in the context of the problem, the assistant is allowed to assume it has the current date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday is 2023-10-04.\n\nBut since the actual date isn't provided, perhaps the assistant should use relative time shifts.\n\nWait, another approach: use the shift_timestamp function. If the assistant can get the current timestamp (somehow), then shift it back by one day to get yesterday's start time, and shift it back by one day and add 24 hours for the end time. But again, without the current timestamp, this isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant should first call a function to get the current timestamp. But there's no such function in the tools. The tools provided are only the ones listed.\n\nLooking back at the tools:\n\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts specific datetime to timestamp.\n- shift_timestamp: shifts a given timestamp.\n- timestamp_diff: calculates difference between two timestamps.\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info: converts timestamp to datetime info.\n",
