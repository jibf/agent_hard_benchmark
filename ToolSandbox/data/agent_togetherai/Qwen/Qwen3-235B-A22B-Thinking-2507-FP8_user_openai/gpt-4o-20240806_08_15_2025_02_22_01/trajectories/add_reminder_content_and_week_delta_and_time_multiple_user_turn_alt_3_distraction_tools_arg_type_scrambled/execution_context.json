                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. So I should call get_current_timestamp. That will give me the current time in POSIX format.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I need to calculate tomorrow at 5 PM. Since 5 PM is 17:00 in 24-hour format, I need to set the time to 17:00 the next day.\n\nWait, but how do I adjust the timestamp? Maybe use shift_timestamp. Let's see. If I get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day and set the time to 17:00. Wait, shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, but if the current time is, say, 3 PM today, adding 1 day would make it 3 PM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So maybe better to calculate the exact time.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info, then set the day to tomorrow, hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0. But that might be more complicated.\n\nWait, there's a function called datetime_info_to_timestamp. So if I can figure out the year, month, day, hour, etc., for tomorrow at 5 PM, I can convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the current date and time. So first step: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that timestamp to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, etc. Then add one day to the day, set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0.\n\nWait, but adding a day might have issues with month ends or leap years. Maybe better to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So if I take current timestamp, shift by 1 day, then set the time to 17:00. But how?\n\nWait, shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, but if the current time is 10 AM, shifting by 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So perhaps:\n\nGet current timestamp.\n\nShift it by 1 day to get tomorrow's same time.\n\nThen, calculate the difference between 17:00 and the current hour. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, convert to datetime_info, then set the day to day+1, hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0. But need to handle cases where day+1 goes to next month, etc.\n\nBut maybe the functions provided can handle that. Let's see.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n\nThen, create a new datetime_info where day is current day +1, hour is 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nBut wait, if today is the last day of the month, adding 1 day would roll over to next month. But the timestamp_to_datetime_info would handle that when converting back.\n\nWait, but the user just said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of the current day, it's the next day at 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n\n2. Convert that to datetime_info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp).\n\n3. Take the datetime_info, add 1 to the day, set hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nWait, but adding 1 to the day might not be safe. For example, if today is March 31, adding 1 day would be April 1. But the datetime_info would have month as 3, day 31. Adding 1 day would require incrementing month and setting day to 1.\n\nBut the timestamp_to_datetime_info function probably returns the correct date components, so if we take the current datetime_info, increment day by 1, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp, it should handle the rollover.\n\nWait, but the user might have said \"tomorrow\" which is exactly 24 hours from now? Or the next calendar day at 5 PM?\n\nHmm, the user probably means the next calendar day at 5 PM. So if today is Monday 10 AM, tomorrow at 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM, not 31 hours later.\n\nSo to get the next calendar day at 5 PM, we need to set the time to 17:00 on the next day.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- Get current datetime info.\n\n- Set the day to current day +1.\n\n- Set hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nBut to do that, we need the current date components.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, create new datetime_info with day = day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values to get the POSIX timestamp.\n\nWait, but the functions available: datetime_info_to_timestamp requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp → current_ts.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts) → current_info.\n\n3. Compute new day: current_info['day'] +1. But need to check if that's valid. Wait, but the timestamp_to_datetime_info function would have the correct current day, so adding 1 would be tomorrow's day, but if it's the end of the month, it would roll over. However, when we pass the new day (current day +1) to datetime_info_to_timestamp, it should handle the rollover correctly.\n\nWait, but if current day is 31 (for a 31-day month), adding 1 would be 32, which is invalid. But the timestamp_to_datetime_info function would have given the correct current day, so adding 1 might not be safe. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle it by rolling over to the next month.\n\nWait, but perhaps the better way is to take the current timestamp, shift it by 24 hours (1 day), then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, shifting by 1 day (24 hours) would give the same time tomorrow. Then, if the current time is, say, 10 AM, shifting by 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow. Then, to get to 5 PM, we need to add 7 hours.\n\nBut the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is a specific time on the next calendar day, not 24 hours from now.\n\nSo if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours from now, not 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to set the time to 17:00 on the next calendar day.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Get current datetime info.\n\n- Set day = current day +1.\n\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, need to get current datetime info.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nThen, take those values, increment day by 1, set hour to 17, etc.\n\nThen, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new values.\n\nWait, but what if the current day is the last day of the month? For example, current day is 31 (January), then day+1 is 32. But when converting to timestamp, it should roll over to February 1.\n\nBut the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that, as it's designed to convert date-time info to a valid timestamp.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n\n3. Create new datetime info with day = day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n4. Convert that to timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the result.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the modified info.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any location, so the reminder doesn't need latitude and longitude.\n\nSo the add_reminder function requires content and reminder_timestamp.\n\nContent is \"tomorrow 5PM\" but probably the user wants a specific reminder content, but the user's message is \"Add a reminder for tomorrow 5PM\". So the content should be something like \"Reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM\", but maybe the user expects the content to be specified. Wait, the user says \"Add a reminder for tomorrow 5PM\" — the content is implied to be the thing they're reminding about, but they didn't specify. Wait, the user's message is the entire request: \"Add a reminder for tomorrow 5PM\". So the content of the reminder is probably \"tomorrow 5PM\", but maybe it's better to ask for clarification. However, the problem states not to make assumptions, but the user's request is to add a reminder for that time, so the content might be something generic like \"Reminder set for tomorrow at 5 PM\", but the function requires content. Wait, the add_reminder function's parameters require 'content' and 'reminder_timestamp'. The user hasn't specified what the reminder is for, just the",
