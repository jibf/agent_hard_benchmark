The response came back with two contacts: Fredrik Thordendal and John Petrucci, both marked as friends.\n\nNow I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants a straightforward list of their friends' names and maybe contact details. Let me check the data. Each entry has person_id, name, phone number, relationship, and is_self. Since the user is asking for friends, the relationship is already \"friend\" in both cases, so I don't need to mention that again. \n\nI should list the names and maybe their phone numbers. Wait, the user might not need the phone numbers, but it's common to include them when listing contacts. Let me make sure to format it neatly. Also, the person_id is there, but the user probably doesn't care about the IDs unless they need to modify or delete a contact later. But since the question is just \"who are my friends,\" focusing on names and phone numbers makes sense.\n\nWait, the response shows two entries. Let me verify if there's any other info. The is_self is False for both, which is correct because they're friends, not the user themselves. So no issues there.\n\nI should structure the answer as a list. Maybe say something like: \"Here are your friends in the contact list:\" followed by each name and phone number. Let me check if the phone numbers are correctly formatted. They have +1 country code, which looks valid.\n\nNo other parameters were provided in the search, so it's just these two. Alright, that's all. Time to put it together in a clear, friendly response.\n</think>\n\nHere are your friends in the contact list:\n\n1. **Fredrik Thordendal**  \n   Phone: +12453344098\n\n2. **John Petrucci**  \n   Phone: +1234560987\n\nLet me know if you'd like to modify or remove any of these contacts!",

I called the modify_contact function for each friend's person_id with the new relationship set to \"enemy\".\n\nFirst, I checked the previous interaction where the user asked for their friends, and the system returned two contacts: Fredrik and John with their respective person_ids. So I used those IDs to modify each contact.\n\nI made two separate tool calls for each person_id. The response from the tool was \"None\" for both, which probably means the modifications were successful since there's no error message. Now I need to confirm to the user that all friends have been updated.\n\nI should list both contacts and state that their relationships are now \"enemy\". Also, offer further help if needed. Let me make sure the message is clear and matches what the user requested.\n</think>\n\nAll your friends have been updated to \"enemy\" in your contacts:\n\n1. **Fredrik Thordendal**  \n   Relationship status updated to *enemy*\n\n2. **John Petrucci**  \n   Relationship status updated to *enemy*\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make further changes! 😈",
