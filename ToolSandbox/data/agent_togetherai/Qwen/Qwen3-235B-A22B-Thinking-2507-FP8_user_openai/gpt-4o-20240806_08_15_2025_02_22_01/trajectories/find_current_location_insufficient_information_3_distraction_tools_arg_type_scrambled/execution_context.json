The user is asking if I know how to use GPS or a maps app on their phone to find their location.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that I don't have access to any device's location services. My previous responses already clarified that I can't get their location directly. Now they're asking for instructions on how to find their coordinates using their own phone.\n\nThe user might not know how to get their latitude and longitude. So, I should explain the steps they can take. But wait, the tools I have are only for searching addresses from lat/lon or stock info. Since they don't have the coordinates, I can't use the search_lat_lon function. But maybe they need guidance on how to obtain those coordinates themselves.\n\nLet me think: common steps for Android and iOS. On Android, opening Google Maps, tapping the blue dot, and getting the coordinates. On iPhone, using the Maps app and long-pressing to drop a pin. Also, some devices have settings where location is shown in status bar or through other apps.\n\nI should provide a general guide without being too technical. Make sure to mention that once they get the numbers, they can share them with me so I can look up the address. Also, reassure them that I don't store any data.\n\nWait, the user said they don't have the info, so they need to find it themselves. My role is to instruct them. Let me check if there's a standard way to explain this. Maybe list steps for both major OSes briefly.\n\nAlso, avoid any assumption about their device. Keep it simple. Don't mention specific apps beyond Google Maps or Apple Maps since those are common.\n\nMake sure to end with asking them to provide the coordinates once they have them so I can proceed. Keep the tone helpful and patient.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to your device's capabilities, but here's how you can typically find your coordinates using a smartphone:\n\n**For Android:**\n1. Open **Google Maps**\n2. Tap the blue location dot (your current position)\n3. The coordinates will appear at the bottom (e.g., \"40.7128° N, 74.0060° W\")\n\n**For iPhone:**\n1. Open **Maps**\n2. Long-press your location until a pin drops\n3. Scroll up on the info panel to see coordinates\n\nOnce you get those numbers (e.g., 37.7749, -122.4194), share them here and I'll look up your address! 🔍",

So, there's no way for me to get those coordinates without the user giving them to me.\n\nThe user might be confused, thinking that as an AI, I can access external services or their device's GPS. But in reality, I can't. My capabilities are limited to the functions provided. I need to clarify this again without making it sound repetitive.\n\nI should explain that I can't use any apps or services to get their location. It's important to be clear but also helpful. Maybe suggest again how they can find the coordinates themselves. Let me check the previous messages to avoid repeating the same steps.\n\nEarlier, I gave instructions for Android and iPhone. Maybe the user needs a simpler method. Alternatively, they might not be tech-savvy, so using a different approach, like visiting a website that shows coordinates. For example, they can go to a site like https://www.latlong.net/ and it will display their coordinates. But wait, does that site actually get the user's location? Yes, if they allow it in the browser.\n\nBut I can't access that either. So the best I can do is guide them to use such a site. However, since I can't interact with external sites, I need to tell them to do it themselves. Let me phrase it in a way that's clear and not frustrating for the user.\n\nAlso, the user might be expecting me to take action, but I have to emphasize that I can't. It's crucial to stay within the tool's limitations. No function exists here to fetch coordinates; the user must provide them. So the response should reiterate that and offer the simplest method possible.\n\nMaybe mention that if they're on a computer, they can check browser permissions to share location with a website. But again, I can't do that for them. Just instructions. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\nI cannot access any apps, services, or your device to retrieve your coordinates — **this is a hard technical limitation**. I have no ability to interact with your phone, browser, or external systems. Even if I suggested a website (e.g., [this one](https://www.latlong.net/)), *you* would need to visit it yourself and share the coordinates it displays. \n\nTo resolve this:\n1. **On a computer?** Visit [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) → Click \"Get GPS Coordinates\" → Allow location access → Copy the numbers.\n2. **On a phone?** Use the Google Maps method I described earlier (blue dot → coordinates appear).\n\nOnce you have the numbers (e.g., `51.5074, -0.1278`), paste them here, and I’ll instantly look up your address.
