Let me check the available tools.\n\nFirst, there's the search_reminder function. It can search for reminders based on various criteria. The user wants to know what's on their todo later, which probably means upcoming reminders. \n\nBut the problem is, the user didn't specify any particular time frame or other details. The search_reminder function requires parameters like reminder_timestamp_upperbound or lowerbound. Without knowing what \"later\" means to the user, I can't set those timestamps.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a way to get the current time and then look for reminders after that. But to do that, I need to convert the current datetime to a timestamp. However, the current time isn't provided here. The tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp, but that requires year, month, day, etc. Since I don't have the current date, I can't generate that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system has a way to get the current timestamp, but the tools don't include a function for that. The available functions are datetime_info_to_timestamp, which needs explicit date parts. Without knowing the current date, I can't use that.\n\nThe user's query is ambiguous because \"later\" isn't defined. It could mean today, tomorrow, this week, etc. Since the function requires specific timestamp bounds, I need to ask for clarification. For example, should I look for reminders in the next hour, today, or another timeframe?\n\nLooking at the tools again, there's also shift_timestamp, which can adjust a timestamp by deltas. But without an initial timestamp, that's not helpful here.\n\nSo the correct step is to inform the user that I need more details. Since the instructions say not to make assumptions, I shouldn't guess what \"later\" means. I should ask for clarification on the time frame they're referring to.\n</think>\n\nTo check your upcoming todos, I'll need more details about the timeframe you're referring to. Could you clarify what you mean by \"later\"? For example:\n- Are you looking for reminders scheduled for today?\n- Within the next hour?\n- This evening?\n- Or another specific timeframe?\n\nThis will help me search your reminders accurately.",

But the user hasn't provided any time info.\n\nWait, the tools available include functions like timestamp_to_datetime_info and datetime_info_to_timestamp. But to get the current time, do I have a function for that? Let me check the tools again.\n\nLooking at the tools: there's timestamp_to_datetime_info, which converts a timestamp to datetime info, but that requires a timestamp. There's also shift_timestamp and timestamp_diff, but those need existing timestamps. The user doesn't know the current time, so maybe I need to generate the current timestamp somehow.\n\nWait, maybe the system has access to the current time, but the user doesn't. But as an assistant, I might need to use the current time as a reference. However, the problem is that the user hasn't provided any specific time, so I can't proceed without knowing the current time to calculate \"later.\"\n\nWait, but the user is saying they don't know the current time, which is a bit odd. Maybe they're in a situation where they can't check the time, so they want to know upcoming todos relative to whenever \"now\" is. But as the assistant, I should have access to the current time to determine what's upcoming.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant's system can get the current timestamp. But according to the problem statement, the assistant has to use the provided tools. Let me check if any of the tools can get the current time.\n\nLooking at the tools again: none of them explicitly get the current timestamp. The functions are for converting, shifting, diffing timestamps, but not for getting the current time. So maybe the assistant can't get the current time through the tools. But the user is asking about \"later,\" which implies relative to now.\n\nThis is a problem. If the user doesn't know the current time and the assistant can't get it via tools, how can we proceed? Wait, maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that it can access the current time, but the tools don't include a function for that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant should use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can generate a timestamp for \"now\" by using the current system time, but since the tools don't have a function for that, maybe the assistant has to ask the user to provide the current time.\n\nBut the user already said they don't know the time. So this is a catch-22. The user can't provide the current time, and the assistant can't get it through the tools. Therefore, the assistant needs to handle this by either making an assumption (which the instructions say not to do) or ask for more info.\n\nWait, the initial instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nIn this case, the user's request is ambiguous because they don't know the current time, so \"later\" is undefined. But the assistant needs to find a way to resolve this.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the current time as a reference, but since the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant has to simulate it. Wait, but the problem states that the assistant can only use the provided tools.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with a timestamp of 0, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should realize that without knowing the current time, it's impossible to determine \"later,\" so the correct action is to inform the user that the current time is needed.\n\nBut the user already said they don't know the time, so maybe the assistant should explain that and suggest a way forward. For example, \"Since you don't know the current time, I can't determine what's 'later.' Could you check the time and let me know, or specify a relative time like 'in 2 hours'?\"\n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should use the tools if possible. However, in this case, without a timestamp for \"now,\" the search_reminder function can't be called with the necessary parameters.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function has parameters like reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. To find reminders that are \"later,\" we'd need to set the lowerbound to the current time. But without knowing the current time, we can't set those bounds.\n\nTherefore, the assistant needs to get the current timestamp. But how? Since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, perhaps the assistant is expected to use an external method, but according to the problem statement, the assistant can only use the provided tools.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, but that requires year, month, day, etc. But the user doesn't know the current time, so they can't provide those values.\n\nThis is a dead end. The correct response here is to inform the user that without knowing the current time, it's impossible to determine what's scheduled for \"later,\" and perhaps ask them to provide the current time or specify a relative timeframe (e.g., \"in 2 hours\") which could be handled with the shift_timestamp function once a reference time is known.\n\nBut since the user said they don't know the time, maybe the assistant should suggest checking the time first. However, the user might not be able to do that, so the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the appropriate response is to explain the issue and ask for clarification, even though the user already said they don't know the time.\n\nWait, the user's second message is \"Hmm, I actually don't know what the time is right now.\" So they're indicating they can't provide the current time. Therefore, the assistant can't determine \"later\" without it. So the assistant should explain that and perhaps offer to show all upcoming reminders once the time is known, but since the time isn't known, maybe list all reminders? But the search_reminder function requires some criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can search for reminders with reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a very large number (far future) and lowerbound set to 0, but that would return all reminders, which might not be helpful. However, the user asked for \"later,\" which implies after now, but without knowing now, it's impossible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the correct action is to inform the user that without the current time, the query can't be resolved, and perhaps suggest that they check the time or provide more context. Since the tools don't allow getting the current time, the assistant can't proceed with a function call here. Therefore, the response should be a message asking for the current time or clarification.\n</think>\n\nSince you don't know the current time, I can't determine what qualifies as \"later\" (e.g., upcoming reminders depend on comparing against the current moment). To resolve this:\n\n1. Could you check your device's clock for the current time?  \n2. Or would you like me to show **all** upcoming reminders (assuming \"later\" means any future-dated reminder)?  \n\nThis will help me use the right timeframe for your search.",

They mentioned that if they knew the time, it would help, but they don't have it right now.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to proceed without the current time. Since the user can't provide the current time, maybe I can get the current timestamp from the system. Wait, but as an AI, I don't have access to real-time data. So I can't just fetch the current time. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the tools provided. There's a function called timestamp_to_datetime_info, but that requires a timestamp to convert. Without knowing the current timestamp, I can't use that. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to assume the current time is now, but since I can't access it, perhaps I need to ask the user to provide the current time or use another approach.\n\nWait, the user is stuck because they don't know the time. But maybe the system (the assistant) can generate the current timestamp using some tool. Wait, checking the tools again. The tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which converts date and time info to a timestamp, but that requires the user to input the date and time. There's also shift_timestamp, which can adjust a timestamp, but again, needs a base timestamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the current time as known by the system. But in reality, the assistant doesn't have access to real-time data. However, in the context of this problem, maybe the tools are designed to handle this. Wait, the problem states that the assistant can call the provided functions. But none of the functions can retrieve the current time. The datetime_info_to_timestamp requires the user to input year, month, etc. So without the user providing the current time, the assistant can't get it.\n\nWait, the user is saying they don't know the time, so they can't tell me what \"later\" means. But maybe the assistant can infer that \"later\" means any future time, so search for all reminders where the reminder timestamp is after the current time. But since the current time isn't known, how can we represent that?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the current time as a reference by generating it through the tools. Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp. The only way is if the user provides the current time. Since the user doesn't have it, maybe the assistant should explain that without knowing the current time, it's impossible to determine what's \"later,\" and suggest that the user check their device's time.\n\nBut the user already said they don't have the time. So the assistant needs to find another way. Wait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp of 0, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can assume that \"later\" means any upcoming reminders, regardless of the current time, but that's not possible because \"later\" is relative to now.\n\nWait, maybe the user is in a scenario where the system (the assistant) actually does have access to the current time, even if the user doesn't. But according to the problem statement, the assistant can't make assumptions. The user says they don't know the time, but maybe the assistant's system clock is available. However, in the context of the given tools, there's no function to get the current timestamp. So the assistant can't retrieve it.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that without the current time, it's impossible to determine what's \"later,\" and they need to provide the current time or check their device. But the user has already stated they don't have it. So perhaps the assistant should offer to show all reminders, or maybe search for reminders in the future based on some default.\n\nWait, but the search_reminder function allows specifying a reminder_timestamp_upperbound or lowerbound. If the user wants \"later,\" that would be reminders with reminder_timestamp greater than the current time. But without knowing the current time, the assistant can't set that lower bound.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create a timestamp for the current moment, but since the user doesn't know the time, the assistant can't input the correct year, month, etc. So this seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp of 0, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps the assistant should explain that without the current time, it's impossible, but since the user is insistent, maybe the assistant can assume that \"later\" means today's date, but again, without knowing the current date, that's not possible.\n\nWait, the user might be in a situation where they don't have a clock, but the assistant's system does. However, per the problem statement, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. The tools don't include a way to get the current time, so the assistant can't proceed without the user providing it.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to tell the user that without the current time, it's impossible to determine what's \"later,\" and they need to check their device's time. But since the user has already said they don't have it, maybe the assistant can offer to list all reminders, or perhaps search for reminders that are in the future relative to some arbitrary point, but that's not accurate.\n\nWait, looking back at the previous messages: the user asked \"What's on my todo later?\" and the assistant asked for clarification. The user said they don't know the time. The assistant then suggested checking the device's clock or showing all upcoming reminders. The user replied that if they knew the time, it would help, but they don't have it.\n\nSo the assistant's next step is to either:\n\n1. Insist that the user needs to provide the current time.\n2. Assume that \"later\" means any future reminders, but without a current time, how to define future?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the current time as known by the system. But in the context of this problem, since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, the assistant can't. Therefore, the only option is to tell the user that without the current time, it's impossible, but perhaps the user can describe the timeframe in another way (e.g., \"after lunch\" or \"in two hours\"), but the user hasn't provided that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp of 0, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps the assistant can generate a timestamp for a default time, but that's making an assumption, which the instructions say not to do.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nIn this case, the user's request is ambiguous because \"later\" is undefined without a reference time. Since the user doesn't know the current time, the assistant can't resolve \"later\" to a specific timeframe. Therefore, the correct action is to ask for clarification, but the user has already stated they don't know the time.\n\nWait, but the assistant has already asked twice for clarification. Maybe the next step is to explain that without the current time, it's impossible, but offer to show all reminders, or perhaps search for reminders with a reminder timestamp in the future, but how?\n\nWait, the search_reminder function allows specifying reminder_timestamp_lowerbound. If the assistant could set that to the current time, but since it's unknown, perhaps the assistant can't. However, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time, but since the user doesn't know it, the assistant can't input the correct values.\n\nThis seems like a catch-22. The user needs the current time to define \"later,\" but they don't have it, and the assistant can't retrieve it via the provided tools.\n\nGiven the constraints, the assistant should inform the user that without the current time, it's impossible to determine what's \"later,\" and perhaps suggest that they check their device's time or provide more context (e.g., \"reminders for today\" even if they don't know the exact time).\n\nBut the user has already said they don't have the time. So maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming that \"later\" means any reminders with a reminder timestamp greater than some default, but that's making an assumption, which is against the instructions.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant could use the timestamp_diff function, but that requires two timestamps.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to create a lower bound. For example, if the user says \"later,\" maybe \"later\" means within the next hour. But without knowing the current time, the assistant can't set the lower bound to current time and upper bound to current time + 1 hour.\n\nThis is tricky. Given the tools provided, the only way to proceed is if the user provides the current time. Since they can't, the assistant must conclude that the request can't be fulfilled without that information.\n\nBut the user is expecting an answer. Maybe the assistant can explain that and offer to list all reminders, so the user can manually check which ones are upcoming once they get the time.\n\nLooking back at the tools, the search_reminder function can be called without any parameters, which would return all reminders. Wait, the required fields for search_reminder are empty, so calling it with no arguments would return all reminders.\n\nAh! That's a possibility. The user asked for \"what's on my todo later,\" but without knowing the time, the assistant can't filter for \"later,\" but can retrieve all reminders and present them to the user. Then the user can determine which ones are \"later\" once they know the time.\n\nSo the correct action",

I tried to call the search_reminder function without any arguments, but got an error saying at least one search criteria is needed.\n\nHmm, so the search_reminder function requires at least one parameter. The user doesn't have the current time, so I can't set a timestamp lower bound. But maybe I can use another approach. Wait, the error message says \"No search criteria are given. At least one search criteria should be provided...\" So I need to include at least one parameter.\n\nBut the user doesn't know the current time, so how can I set a reminder_timestamp_lowerbound? Maybe I can't. Wait, maybe the user has some other criteria. The user said \"what's on my todo later,\" which implies future reminders. Without current time, but maybe the system can assume the current time is now. But since I can't get the current time, perhaps the assistant should use a different method.\n\nWait, the tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp, but that requires the user to input the date and time. Since the user doesn't know the time, I can't use that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function, but again, needs a base timestamp.\n\nWait, the error occurred because I called search_reminder with no arguments. The function requires at least one parameter. So I need to provide at least one. But the user doesn't have the current time. Maybe the assistant can assume that \"later\" means any reminders with a reminder timestamp in the future, but without knowing the current time, how to set that?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the current time as known by the system. But the problem states that the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. However, in reality, the assistant might have access to the current time, but according to the problem's context, the user doesn't. But the tools don't have a function to get the current time. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the current time as a reference even if the user doesn't know it.\n\nWait, but the user is the one who doesn't know the time, but the system (assistant) might. However, in the context of this problem, the assistant's tools don't include a way to get the current timestamp. So the assistant can't generate it. Therefore, the assistant can't set a reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to the current time.\n\nBut the error says that at least one search criteria is needed. So maybe the assistant has to make an assumption here, but the instructions say not to make assumptions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the user has some other criteria. For example, maybe they have a reminder with a specific content or ID. But the user hasn't provided any. The user's query is very vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default value. For example, set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to 0, which would include all future reminders, but that's not correct because 0 is a specific timestamp (1970-01-01). But if the user's reminders are all in the future relative to 1970, then it would return all. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the error message says \"At least one search criteria should be provided among ('reminder_id', 'content', 'creation_timestamp', 'creation_timestamp', 'reminder_timestamp', 'reminder_timestamp', 'latitude', 'longitude')\". Wait, the parameters listed in the function include creation_timestamp_lowerbound, creation_timestamp_upperbound, reminder_timestamp_lowerbound, reminder_timestamp_upperbound. So maybe the assistant needs to specify at least one of these.\n\nBut without knowing the current time, how can we set a lower bound for reminder_timestamp? Maybe the assistant can assume that \"later\" means any reminders, so set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to a very old timestamp, like 0, which would include all reminders that have a reminder time after 1970. But that's not helpful because all reminders are likely after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the current time as known by the system. Even though the user doesn't know it, the system might. But according to the problem statement, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. However, in practice, the assistant would have access to the current time. But given the tools provided, there's no function to get the current timestamp. So the assistant can't.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create a timestamp for the current moment, but that requires the user to input the current date and time. Since the user doesn't know it, they can't provide it. So that's not possible.\n\nThis is a problem. The user wants to know upcoming todos but can't provide current time, and the assistant can't retrieve it. The search_reminder function requires at least one parameter. The previous attempt to call it with no parameters failed.\n\nSo what's the solution here? Maybe the assistant should explain that without the current time, it's impossible, but since the user insists, perhaps the assistant can use a placeholder or assume a time. But the instructions say not to make assumptions.\n\nWait, the user said \"Sorry, if I don't have the current time I can't look up what's coming up later.\" So they're acknowledging that without the current time, it's impossible. But the assistant needs to respond.\n\nWait, the previous tool call was invalid because no parameters were given. So the assistant needs to provide at least one parameter. Maybe the assistant can use a fuzzy search on content, but the user didn't specify any content. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can set a very broad range for the reminder timestamp.\n\nWait, if the assistant sets reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to 0 and reminder_timestamp_upperbound to a very large number (like 2^63), that would effectively return all reminders. But the function's description says that the search criteria are matched with exact, fuzzy, or range. So if both lower and upper bounds are provided, it would return reminders within that range.\n\nBut the user wants \"later,\" which is future reminders. Without current time, but if the assistant assumes that \"later\" means any reminders, then setting the lower bound to 0 and upper bound to a high value would get all. However, the error was because no parameters were given. So providing both lower and upper bounds as 0 and a large number might work.\n\nWait, but the user's problem is that they don't know the current time, so they can't define \"later.\" But the assistant might know the current time. Wait, but according to the problem's context, the assistant doesn't have access to real-time data unless through the tools. Since there's no tool to get current time, the assistant can't.\n\nThis is a dead end. The correct approach is to inform the user that without the current time, it's impossible, but since the tool requires at least one parameter, perhaps the assistant can use a default. However, the instructions say not to make assumptions.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to calculate a timestamp based on some delta, but without a base timestamp, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant can ask the user to provide a reference time, but the user already said they don't have it.\n\nGiven that the tool call without parameters is invalid, the assistant must provide at least one parameter. Since the user is asking for \"later,\" which implies future reminders, the assistant needs to set a lower bound for reminder_timestamp. But without current time, the assistant can't. However, perhaps the assistant can use the current time as known by the system (even if the user doesn't know it), but how?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant's system clock is available, and the assistant can use that to generate the current timestamp. For example, using Python's time.time(), but in the context of this problem, the assistant has to use the provided tools. Since there's no tool to get the current timestamp, the assistant can't.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to explain that without the current time, it's impossible, but since the tool requires a parameter, perhaps the assistant has to make an educated guess. But the instructions say not to make assumptions.\n\nWait, the error message from the tool says \"No search criteria are given. At least one search criteria should be provided...\" So the assistant must include at least one. Maybe the assistant can use a very broad search, like content fuzzy match with an empty string, which might return all. But the content parameter is for fuzzy matching, and an empty string might not work.\n\nAlternatively, set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to 0, which would include all reminders from the beginning of time. But the user wants \"later,\" which is future, but without current time, this is all reminders.\n\nWait, the user might have meant \"later today\" or something, but without knowing the time, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the constraints, the assistant has to provide at least one parameter. The safest bet is to set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to 0 and reminder_timestamp_upperbound to a very large number to get all reminders. Even though it's not exactly \"later,\" it's the only way to satisfy the tool's requirement.\n\nSo the tool call would be search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound=0 and reminder_timestamp_upperbound=9999999999 (a large number). This would return all reminders, which the user can then check once they have the current time.\n\nLet me check the parameters: reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound are optional, but at least one search criteria is needed. So providing both lower and upper bounds would satisfy the requirement.\n\nYes, that should work. So the assistant should call search_reminder with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"search_reminder\", \"arguments\": {\"reminder_timestamp_lowerbound\": 0, \"reminder_timestamp",
