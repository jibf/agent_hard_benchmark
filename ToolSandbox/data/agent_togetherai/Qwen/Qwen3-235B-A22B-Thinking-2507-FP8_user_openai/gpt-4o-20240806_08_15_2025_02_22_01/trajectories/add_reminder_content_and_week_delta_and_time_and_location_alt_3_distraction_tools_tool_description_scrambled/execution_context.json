The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. The current timestamp is given as 1755253809.47859. Let me convert that to a date to understand what \"tomorrow\" means.\n\nUsing the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might help here. Wait, but the user already provided the current timestamp. Maybe I should first convert that to datetime info to know the current date and time.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is 1755253809.47859. Let me check what date that is. But maybe I don't need to do that manually. Since the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\", I need to calculate the timestamp for tomorrow at 17:00 (5 PM in 24h format).\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the current date. So perhaps I should call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp to get the current year, month, day, etc. Then add one day to get tomorrow's date, set the time to 17:00:00, and then convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, the tools available include datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info. So steps:\n\n1. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp (1755253809.47859) to get current datetime components.\n2. Calculate tomorrow's date by adding 1 to the day (handling month/year rollover if needed, but maybe the function handles that? Probably not, so need to be careful).\n3. Set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the POSIX timestamp for tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since the user says \"tomorrow\", which is 24 hours from now, but 5 PM might not be exactly 24 hours later if current time is after 5 PM. Wait, the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5 PM.\n\nSo if today is, say, Monday, and current time is 6 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later. So better to calculate based on date, not just adding 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, need to get current date, add one day, set time to 17:00.\n\nSo first step: convert current timestamp to datetime info.\n\nCall timestamp_to_datetime_info with timestamp 1755253809.47859.\n\nWait, the user provided the current timestamp as 1755253809.47859. Let me check what that date is. Let me compute it.\n\nWait, 1755253809 seconds since epoch. Let me see: the current time as of 2023 is around 1.6-1.7 billion, so 1.755 billion is about 2025-2026? Maybe not important, but the exact date isn't necessary as the function will handle it.\n\nSo first tool call: timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n\nThen, take the year, month, day, add 1 to day (if day is 31, handle month rollover, etc.), but maybe the function will handle that when converting back? Wait, no. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function expects valid date components, so need to make sure that adding 1 to the day is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can handle it, but to be safe, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nGet current datetime info (year, month, day, hour, min, sec).\n\nThen, set the time to 17:00:00 on the next day.\n\nSo if current day is D, then tomorrow is D+1. But need to check if D+1 is valid for the month.\n\nBut since the tool's datetime_info_to_timestamp will validate the date, perhaps we can just increment the day by 1 and let the function handle it. Wait, no, the function expects valid parameters, so if we pass an invalid day (like 32 for a 31-day month), it might error. So better to handle it properly.\n\nBut since I can't compute that here, maybe the correct step is to get the current datetime, add 24 hours to the timestamp, but adjust to 5 PM.\n\nWait, another approach: current timestamp is T. Tomorrow at 5 PM is T + (24 hours - current time part + 17 hours). Hmm, maybe complicated.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, add 24 hours, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is:\n\n1. Get current datetime components (year, month, day, hour, min, sec) via timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\n2. Compute tomorrow's date: if current hour is >=17, then tomorrow is day+1, else same day? Wait, no. \"Tomorrow 5PM\" is always the next day at 5PM, regardless of current time.\n\nWait, for example, if today is Monday 6 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later.\n\nSo regardless of current time, \"tomorrow 5PM\" is the next calendar day at 17:00.\n\nTherefore, steps:\n\n- Get current datetime (Y, M, D, h, m, s).\n\n- Set D = D + 1.\n\n- Set h = 17, m = 0, s = 0.\n\n- Convert (Y, M, D, 17, 0, 0) to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if D+1 exceeds days in month, etc. However, since the function datetime_info_to_timestamp will handle that (assuming it's a valid date), but if we pass an invalid date (like February 30), it might fail. So perhaps the correct way is to add 1 day to the current timestamp, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, adding 1 day (86400 seconds) to current timestamp gives same time tomorrow. Then, if current time is after 5 PM, that would be tomorrow at same time, which is after 5 PM, so we need to subtract the difference between current time and 5 PM? No, because user said \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is a specific time.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCompute the timestamp for today at 5 PM. If that's in the past, then use tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut the user said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day.\n\nWait, the user explicitly said \"tomorrow 5PM\", so it's definitely the next day, not today.\n\nTherefore, regardless of current time, it's (current date + 1 day) at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current datetime components.\n\n2. Increment day by 1.\n\n3. Set time to 17:00:00.\n\n4. Convert to timestamp.\n\nSo first, need to call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp (1755253809.47859) to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, create a new datetime with day+1, hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n\nThen call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nOnce we have the reminder timestamp, we need to find the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nSo next, use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But the function requires either latitude and longitude or defaults to current. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon has parameters: location (required), latitude (optional, defaults to current), longitude (optional, defaults to current).\n\nBut we don't have current latitude and longitude. Wait, the previous step gave us the current timestamp, but not the current location. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user didn't provide current location. So perhaps we need to assume that the current location is not known, but the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires latitude and longitude if not using current. But since we don't have current, maybe the function can't be called without lat/lon. Wait, the description says \"Defaults to current latitude if not provided\", but if current latitude isn't known, how can it default?\n\nThis is a problem. The function search_location_around_lat_lon requires location, and optionally lat/lon. But if lat/lon aren't provided, it uses current. However, in this scenario, we don't have the current location. So maybe the function expects that the system has access to current location, but in the context of this problem, since it's a simulation, perhaps we need to proceed by assuming that the current location is available, but in the tool call, we can omit lat/lon and let it default.\n\nWait, the function's parameters say latitude and longitude are optional, defaulting to current. So in the tool call for search_location_around_lat_lon, we can just provide the location, and omit lat/lon, so it uses current.\n\nBut in this case, the user's request is to set a reminder at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So we need to get the latitude and longitude of that location to",
