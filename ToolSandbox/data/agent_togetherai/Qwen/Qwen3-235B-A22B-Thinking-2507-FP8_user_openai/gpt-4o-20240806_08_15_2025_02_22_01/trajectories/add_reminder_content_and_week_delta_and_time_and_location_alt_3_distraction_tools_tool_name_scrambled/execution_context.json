                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions to use. The main task is adding a reminder. There's a function called reminder_0 for adding a reminder. The required parameters are content and reminder_timestamp.\n\nThe content is \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But wait, the location is Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. To set the reminder with location, I need latitude and longitude. But the user didn't provide coordinates. So maybe I need to first get the coordinates of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nLooking at the tools, there's rapid_api_search_tools_2 which searches for a location around a latitude and longitude. But since the user mentioned \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", maybe I should use that function to find the address and get the latitude and longitude.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify a current location. The function rapid_api_search_tools_2 requires a location string. The parameters are location (required), latitude, and longitude (optional, default to current). But since the user hasn't provided current coordinates, maybe I can't get the exact location. Hmm, but maybe the function can search based on the location string alone, like \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nWait, the description says: \"location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address.\" So if I use location as \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", the function should return the address and coordinates.\n\nSo first step: call rapid_api_search_tools_2 with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the latitude and longitude.\n\nThen, once I have the coordinates, I can set the reminder with reminder_0, using the content, the timestamp for tomorrow 5 PM, and the latitude/longitude from the search.\n\nBut wait, the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". I need to calculate the POSIX timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. To do that, I need the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. So maybe first call utilities_2 to get the current timestamp, then calculate tomorrow's timestamp.\n\nWait, but utilities_2 gives the current POSIX timestamp. Then, using that, I can compute tomorrow's date. Alternatively, use utilities_1 to convert tomorrow's date and time into a timestamp.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the date, just \"tomorrow\". So I need to figure out tomorrow's date based on current date.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using utilities_2.\n2. Convert current timestamp to date components using utilities_7 to find today's date.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day).\n4. Set time to 5 PM (17:00).\n5. Convert that date/time to POSIX timestamp using utilities_1.\n6. Search for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to get coordinates.\n7. Add reminder with content, timestamp, and coordinates.\n\nBut the user might not have provided current location, so maybe the search for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek will return the correct location without needing current coordinates. Let's check the function description for rapid_api_search_tools_2: \"When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" But since we don't have current location, maybe the search is still possible just by the location string. The function requires \"location\" as a parameter, which is provided as \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nSo first, call rapid_api_search_tools_2 with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the coordinates.\n\nThen, handle the timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". To get the exact timestamp, need to know current date. So need to get current timestamp first.\n\nWait, but maybe the system can handle \"tomorrow\" without current time? Probably not. So first step is to get current timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n2. Use utilities_7 to convert current timestamp to date components (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day to current day, handling month/year changes if needed).\n4. Set time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n5. Use utilities_1 to convert that date/time to POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't compute dates itself, it needs to use the tools. So first, get current timestamp with utilities_2.\n\nWait, but the user might be in a different timezone. However, the problem doesn't specify, so assume the timestamp is in the user's local time, which the system handles.\n\nSo step-by-step:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp via utilities_2.\n\nThen, convert that timestamp to date components via utilities_7 to know today's date.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date.\n\nBut the assistant can't do calculations, so it needs to use the tools. Wait, utilities_1 is for converting a date to timestamp, but to get tomorrow's date, the assistant would need to calculate it based on current date.\n\nBut the assistant can't perform date arithmetic, so perhaps the user expects the system to handle \"tomorrow\" as +24 hours from now. However, 24 hours might not account for DST changes, but maybe for simplicity, the system just adds 86400 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant should use the current timestamp, add 86400 (seconds in a day), set the time to 17:00, but that's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: get current timestamp, convert to date, increment day by 1, set time to 17:00, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant needs to use the tools for conversion.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp (let's say it's 1717020000, which is some date).\n2. Call utilities_7 with that timestamp to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Then, create a new date: tomorrow's year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Call utilities_1 with those values to get the POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do this step-by-step without user input, it has to make multiple tool calls.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to add the reminder. The assistant needs to figure out all the parameters.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- First, get current time via utilities_2.\n- Then, convert current time to date parts via utilities_7.\n- Then, calculate tomorrow's date (current day +1).\n- Then, set time to 17:00:00.\n- Convert that to timestamp via utilities_1.\n- Then, search for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to get lat/long.\n- Finally, add the reminder with content, timestamp, and lat/long.\n\nBut each of these requires sequential tool calls. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, no—the problem says \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags\". So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in sequence, but each in its own tool_call.\n\nBut the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to determine the necessary steps and make the appropriate tool calls.\n\nBut given that the assistant is supposed to respond with the tool calls needed, perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow's 5 PM.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler way. If the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", perhaps the assistant can assume that \"tomorrow\" is 24 hours from now, but that's not accurate because 5PM tomorrow is not necessarily 24 hours from now (e.g., if it's 6PM today, 5PM tomorrow is 23 hours later). So better to calculate based on current date.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Convert to date components (utilities_7).\n3. Increment day by 1, set time to 17:00:00.\n4. Convert back to timestamp (utilities_1).\n5. Search location for Whole Foods (rapid_api_search_tools_2).\n6. Add reminder with content, timestamp, and location coordinates.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations, each step requires a tool call.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the assistant should return the tool calls needed. So the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nSo first tool call: utilities_2.\n\nThen, once we have current timestamp, use utilities_7 to get date parts.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls needed to fulfill the user's request. Since the user hasn't provided current location or timestamp, the assistant needs to gather that information.\n\nBut the user's main request is to add a reminder. So the assistant must determine the reminder timestamp and location coordinates.\n\nTherefore, the first tool call should be to get the current timestamp (utilities_2), then process that to find tomorrow's 5 PM.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do the calculation itself, it needs to use the tools step by step.\n\nWait, but perhaps the assistant can assume that \"tomorrow 5PM\" can be converted by adding 1 day to the current date at 5PM. However, without knowing the current time, it's hard. For example, if it's 6PM today, tomorrow 5PM is 23 hours later.\n\nBut the correct way is to take today's date, add one day, set time to 17:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n-",
