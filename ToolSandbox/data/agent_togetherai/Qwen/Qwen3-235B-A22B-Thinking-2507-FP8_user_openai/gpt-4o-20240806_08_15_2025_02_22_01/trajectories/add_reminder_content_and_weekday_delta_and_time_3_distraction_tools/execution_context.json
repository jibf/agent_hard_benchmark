                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for \"next Friday 5PM\". But wait, what's today's date? Since I don't have real-time data, I should probably get the current timestamp first. So I'll call get_current_timestamp to know the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can convert it to datetime info to see what day of the week it is. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe use the shift_timestamp function. But to know how many days until next Friday, I need to know the current day.\n\nHmm, perhaps the steps are: get current timestamp, convert to datetime info to find the current day, calculate how many days until next Friday, then shift the timestamp accordingly.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\". If today is Friday, does \"next Friday\" mean this week's Friday or the following one? Usually, \"next Friday\" would mean the upcoming one, so if today is Friday, it would be 7 days later. But sometimes people might mean the same day. But to be safe, assuming \"next Friday\" is the next occurrence, which could be 0-6 days away.\n\nWait, but let's think. Let's say today is Tuesday. Next Friday is in 3 days. If today is Friday, next Friday is in 7 days.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp. Then convert to datetime info to get the current day of the week (isoweekday). ISO weekday is 1=Monday, 7=Sunday. So Friday is 5.\n\nSo if current isoweekday is 5 (Friday), then next Friday is 7 days later. If current is 6 (Saturday), next Friday is 6 days later, etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime_info to get current day (isoweekday).\n3. Calculate days until next Friday.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by the calculated days and set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user said 5 PM. So after finding the date of next Friday, set the time to 17:00 (24h format).\n\nAlternatively, maybe use shift_timestamp with days and hours.\n\nWait, but first, need to compute how many days to add. Let's say current isoweekday is X. Next Friday is (5 - X) mod 7. But if X is 5 (Friday), then (5-5)=0, but we want 7 days, so maybe (5 - X + 7) %7. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf today is Monday (1), next Friday is 4 days later (1 -> 5: 5-1=4).\n\nIf today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later (5+7=12, 12 mod 7=5).\n\nSo the formula is (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nDays until next Friday = (5 - current_day + 7) %7.\n\nWait, if current_day is 5 (Friday), (5-5 +7)=7, 7%7=0. But we need 7 days, so perhaps if the result is 0, it's 7 days.\n\nWait, maybe better to compute:\n\ndays_ahead = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nif days_ahead <=0, then days_ahead +=7\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday), 5-5=0. 0%7=0. So days_ahead=0. But we want 7 days, so add 7.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\ndays_ahead = (5 - current_day + 7) %7\n\nBut if current_day=5, (5-5+7)=7, 7%7=0. So days_ahead=0. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: days until next Friday is (5 - current_day) if current_day <=5, else (5 - current_day +7).\n\nWait:\n\ncurrent_day=1 (Mon): 5-1=4 days.\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Fri): 5-5=0, but next Friday is 7 days later, so 7.\n\ncurrent_day=6 (Sat): 5-6= -1, so -1 +7=6 days.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo days_ahead = (5 - current_day +7) %7\n\nWait:\n\nFor current_day=5: (5-5 +7)=7, 7%7=0. So 0, but we need 7. So perhaps if days_ahead is 0, set to 7.\n\nAlternatively, days_ahead = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nif days_ahead <=0, days_ahead +=7\n\nWait:\n\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5)=0 → 0%7=0 → days_ahead=0 → add 7 → 7.\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6)= -1 → -1%7=6 → days_ahead=6.\n\ncurrent_day=1: 4 → 4.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days_ahead = (5 - isoweekday) %7. If days_ahead <=0, days_ahead +=7.\n\nWait, no: (5 - isoweekday) %7. Wait, modulo operation for negative numbers can be tricky. Let's use:\n\ndays_ahead = (5 - isoweekday +7) %7\n\nBut if the result is 0, it means same day, so we need 7 days.\n\nWait, let's take examples:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday):\n\n(5 -5 +7)=7 → 7%7=0 → days_ahead=0 → need to add 7 days.\n\ncurrent_day=6 (Saturday):\n\n(5-6 +7)=6 → 6%7=6 → days_ahead=6.\n\ncurrent_day=1 (Monday):\n\n(5-1 +7)=11 → 11%7=4 → days_ahead=4.\n\nSo yes, days_ahead = (5 - current_day +7) %7.\n\nBut if days_ahead is 0, then it's 7 days.\n\nSo days_to_add = days_ahead if days_ahead !=0 else 7.\n\nWait, but in the case of current_day=5, (5-5+7)=7 → 7%7=0 → days_ahead=0 → so days_to_add=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo once days_to_add is calculated, then the target date is current date + days_to_add days, and time set to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nBut how to set the time to 5 PM? Because the current timestamp's time is whatever it is now.\n\nSo after adding days_to_add days, we need to set the hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. But if we shift by days_to_add days, then also shift by (17 - current_hour) hours, but that might not be accurate because if current time is after 5 PM, then adding days_to_add days and then setting to 5 PM would require adjusting.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get current date and time.\n\n3. Calculate the target date: next Friday.\n\n4. Set the time to 17:00:00.\n\n5. Convert that target datetime to timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Convert to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\n- Calculate target date (next Friday).\n\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to calculate target date?\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add the days_ahead, then adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp shifts the entire timestamp by the deltas. So if current time is, say, 10 AM on Tuesday, and we need to get to 5 PM on Friday (3 days later), we can shift by 3 days and 7 hours (from 10 AM to 5 PM is 7 hours). But that's only if the current time is before 5 PM.\n\nWait, but if the current time is after 5 PM on the day before Friday, say Thursday at 6 PM, then next Friday at 5 PM is 23 hours later.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get current isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days until next Friday (as above).\n\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_ahead days.\n\n5. Then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to set the time? The shift_timestamp function can shift by hours, minutes, etc. So after shifting by days_ahead days, we need to adjust the hour to 17.\n\nWait, but the current time after shifting days_ahead days will have the same time as now. So if today is Tuesday 10 AM, and days_ahead=3 (to Friday), then shifted timestamp is Friday 10 AM. Then we need to add 7 hours to get to 5 PM.\n\n",
