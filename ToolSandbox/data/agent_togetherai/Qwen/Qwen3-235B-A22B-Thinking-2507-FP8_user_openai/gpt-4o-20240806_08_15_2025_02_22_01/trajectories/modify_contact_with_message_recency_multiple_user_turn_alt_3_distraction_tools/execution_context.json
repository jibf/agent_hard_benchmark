But the search_contacts function doesn't have a way to list all; it requires at least one criteria. So without any criteria, it's not possible.

If they don't have any info, adding a new contact isn't the solution. The user specifically said \"change someone's phone number,\" implying an existing contact.\n\nSo the conclusion is that without any details, the system can't find the contact to modify. The assistant should state that clearly and maybe offer to help later when more info is available. No tool calls can be made here because there's no data to use.

Search for the contact using fuzzy matching (e.g., \"part of a name\" or \"last 4 digits of number\")\n2. Verify the correct entry\n3.
