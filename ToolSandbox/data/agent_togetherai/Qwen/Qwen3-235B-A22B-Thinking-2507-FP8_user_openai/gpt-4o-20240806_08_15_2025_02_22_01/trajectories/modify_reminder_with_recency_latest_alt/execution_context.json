                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out what functions to use here.\n\nThe main goal is to modify a reminder's time to tomorrow 5 PM. But to do that, I need the reminder ID. The user didn't specify which reminder, so I should probably search for the upcoming one.\n\nFirst step: find the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. I can use get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. But wait, to convert that to a POSIX timestamp, I need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But I need the exact date components.\n\nWait, maybe first get the current timestamp. Let's call get_current_timestamp. Once I have that, convert it to datetime info to find today's date. Then compute tomorrow's date. For example, if today is the 10th, tomorrow is 11th. Then set the time to 5 PM (17:00). Then convert that datetime to a timestamp.\n\nBut the user said \"upcoming reminder\". So maybe there's a reminder that's scheduled soon, and they want to move it to tomorrow 5 PM. So first, I need to search for the upcoming reminder. How do I define upcoming? Maybe the next one after the current time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (using get_current_timestamp).\n2. Search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is after current timestamp, maybe the closest one.\n3. Once found, modify its reminder_timestamp to tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user says \"push my upcoming reminder to tomorrow 5PM\". So they might have one specific upcoming reminder they want to reschedule.\n\nBut to do that, I need to first find which reminder is the upcoming one. So first, call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_upperbound as current timestamp + some buffer? Or maybe search for reminders with reminder_timestamp >= current timestamp, and take the earliest one.\n\nBut the search_reminder function allows setting lower and upper bounds for reminder_timestamp. So maybe set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to current timestamp, and get the first result.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp.\n\nCall get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current_timestamp.\n\nAssuming that returns the next upcoming reminder.\n\nOnce I have the reminder ID from the search, then modify it to the new time.\n\nBut the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". So need to calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM as a timestamp.\n\nTo calculate that, need to know today's date, add one day, set time to 17:00.\n\nSo after getting current timestamp, convert it to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info), then increment the day by 1, set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0. Then convert back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but if today is the 31st of a month, adding a day would roll over to next month. But the functions handle that, right? The datetime_info_to_timestamp should handle date arithmetic correctly.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date: day +1. If day exceeds month days, adjust month and year accordingly.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert that datetime to timestamp.\n6. Search for the upcoming reminder (the next one after current time).\n7. Modify that reminder's timestamp to the new timestamp.\n\nBut the user didn't specify which reminder, so the assistant needs to find the \"upcoming\" one, which is probably the next one.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current date/time.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to get current timestamp, then add 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's same time, but the user wants 5 PM. So if current time is, say, 10 AM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 31 hours from now. But maybe better to calculate the exact date.\n\nAlternatively, take current datetime, set time to 17:00, add one day.\n\nWait, the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\", so regardless of current time, it's 5 PM the next day.\n\nSo for example, if today is Monday 10 AM, tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Convert to datetime info.\n\n- Add one day to the date.\n\n- Set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0.\n\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day+1, 17, 0, 0.\n\nWait, but need to handle month/year rollover. But the function datetime_info_to_timestamp should handle that as long as the input is valid. So if day is 31 and month is January, adding 1 day would make it February 1.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\ntomorrow_dt = {\n  year: current_dt.year,\n  month: current_dt.month,\n  day: current_dt.day + 1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut need to check if day exceeds days in month, but the function should handle it. Wait, no, the user has to input valid date. So if current day is 31, and month has 31 days, adding 1 would be 32, which is invalid. So the function might throw an error. But perhaps the assistant should handle it by incrementing month and resetting day.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do that, maybe it's better to use the current timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds) and then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, another approach: take current timestamp, add 86400 seconds (1 day), then set the time part to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to set the time part? For example, current timestamp is 1717020000 (which is some date), adding 86400 gives tomorrow's same time. Then, to set to 5 PM, need to adjust the hours.\n\nAlternatively, take the current date, set time to 17:00, then add one day.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\ntomorrow_5pm = {\n  year: current_dt.year,\n  month: current_dt.month,\n  day: current_dt.day + 1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut if day+1 is invalid, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle it by rolling over. Wait, no, the function expects valid date components. So if day is 31 and month is April (which has 30 days), then day=31 is invalid, and the function would return an error. So the assistant needs to handle that.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform date arithmetic, perhaps a better approach is to get the current timestamp, then add the number of seconds until tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nFor example, current time is 10 AM today. Tomorrow 5 PM is 31 hours from now. So calculate the difference.\n\nBut how to compute that? Maybe:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\ntarget_dt = {\n  year: current_dt.year,\n  month: current_dt.month,\n  day: current_dt.day,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\ntarget_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(target_dt)\n\nif target_ts < current_ts:\n  # target time is today but already passed, so set to tomorrow\n  target_dt['day'] += 1\n  target_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(target_dt)\n\nBut again, handling day rollover.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, add 24 hours, then set time to 17:00.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\n# add 24 hours (86400 seconds)\ntomorrow_same_time = current_ts + 86400\n\n# convert to datetime info\ndt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(tomorrow_same_time)\n\n# set hour to 17, min/sec to 0\nnew_dt = {\n  year: dt.year,\n  month: dt.month,\n  day: dt.day,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nnew_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(new_dt)\n\nBut this might not work if adding 24 hours crosses a DST boundary, but POSIX timestamp handles that.\n\nWait, but POSIX timestamp is in UTC, so maybe the time zones are handled correctly. Assuming all timestamps are in UTC.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify time zones, so we'll proceed with the assumption that all times are in the same time zone, probably UTC.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Set time to 17:00:00 of the next day.\n   - If current time is before 17:00 today, then tomorrow 17:00 is today + (1",
