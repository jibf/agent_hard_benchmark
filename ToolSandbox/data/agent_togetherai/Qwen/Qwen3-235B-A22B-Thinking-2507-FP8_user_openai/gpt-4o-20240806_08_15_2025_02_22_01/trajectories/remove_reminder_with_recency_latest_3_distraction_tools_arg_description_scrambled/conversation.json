The response was 1755255732.549174. Then, I used search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to that timestamp to find reminders that are upcoming (i.e., timestamp is after now). But the response was an empty list, meaning there are no reminders scheduled after the current time.\n\nWait, so if there are no upcoming reminders, then there's nothing to remove. The user might have thought they had an upcoming reminder, but according to the search, there aren't any. So I should inform them that no upcoming reminders were found. But the user's instruction was to remove the upcoming reminder, so if there's none, I need to state that clearly.\n\nLet me check if I did the search correctly. The search_reminder function with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the current timestamp should return reminders that are set to trigger after now. Since the result is empty, there are no such reminders. Therefore, the correct response is to tell the user there are no upcoming reminders to remove. I don't need to call remove_reminder because there's nothing to remove. So the next step is to generate a message saying that no upcoming reminders were found.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders scheduled after the current time. Please check if you have any reminders set for a future date or time."

Let me think about what they need now.\n\nFirst, they asked to remove their upcoming reminder. I checked using the current timestamp and searched for reminders after that time. The search came back empty, so I informed them there are none. Now they're thanking me, which probably means they understand there's nothing to remove.\n\nI should make sure there's no further action needed. Since the search result was empty, there's no reminder to delete. The user might just be acknowledging the response. No tools need to be called here because the issue is resolved. They might have thought they had a reminder, but it's not there. Maybe they set it for a past date or deleted it already. Either way, the system checked and found nothing. So the appropriate response is to confirm and offer further help if needed.\n\nI should respond politely, confirming that there are no upcoming reminders and offering assistance if they need anything else. No function calls required since the problem is already addressed.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. 😊"
