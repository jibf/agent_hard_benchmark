                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the reminder they created yesterday. Hmm, first I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" means in terms of timestamps. Since the user is asking about a reminder created yesterday, I should probably get the current timestamp first to know what yesterday's date is.\n\nWait, the tools provided include get_current_timestamp, which gives the current POSIX timestamp. So I should call that first. Once I have the current timestamp, I can calculate the start and end of yesterday. But how?\n\nMaybe I need to shift the current timestamp back by one day to get yesterday's timestamp. But wait, the shift_timestamp function can adjust a timestamp by days. Let me check the parameters. Shift_timestamp requires a timestamp and deltas like days, hours, etc.\n\nSo first, get_current_timestamp to get now. Then, shift it back by one day to get the start of yesterday? Wait, but the user might have created the reminder at any time yesterday, so I need a lower and upper bound for the creation timestamp.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function has parameters for creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So I need to find the timestamp for the start of yesterday (00:00:00) and the end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nBut how to get those exact times? Let's think. If I get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get yesterday's date, but then I need to set the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound.\n\nWait, maybe using timestamp_to_datetime_info to convert the current timestamp to date parts, then adjust the date to yesterday, then convert back to timestamp. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, shift it back by one day, but then adjust the time to midnight. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Let's say the current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:00 UTC. Then yesterday would be 2023-10-04. The creation_timestamp_lowerbound would be 2023-10-04 00:00:00 UTC, and upperbound would be 2023-10-04 23:59:59 UTC.\n\nTo get those timestamps, perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert now to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Subtract one day from the current date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Set the time to 00:00:00 for lower bound and 23:59:59 for upper bound.\n5. Convert those datetime info back to timestamps.\n\nWait, but the tools don't have a function to set a specific date/time directly. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function can convert a given year, month, day, etc., into a timestamp. So maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get current date.\n- Subtract one day from the current date (maybe using shift_timestamp with days=-1 on the current timestamp to get a timestamp for yesterday at the same time).\n- But then to get the start of yesterday, we need to set hour, minute, second to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get 'now'.\n2. Use shift_timestamp to subtract one day from 'now' to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago. But that's not exactly the start of yesterday. For example, if now is 14:30, subtracting one day gives 14:30 yesterday, but we need 00:00 yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, convert 'now' to datetime info, then create a new datetime for yesterday at 00:00:00.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n- Convert that timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current year, month, day, etc.\n- Subtract one day from the current day (if day is 1, handle month/year changes, but maybe the shift_timestamp can handle that).\n- Wait, maybe better to use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp by -1 day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago, but that's not the start of the day.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, subtract the number of seconds since midnight. For example, if current time is 14:30, subtract 14*3600 + 30*60 seconds to get to midnight today, then subtract 24 hours to get to midnight yesterday.\n\nBut how to compute that? Maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Convert now to datetime info to get hour, minute, second.\n- Calculate seconds since midnight: (hour * 3600 + minute * 60 + second).\n- Subtract that from now to get today's midnight.\n- Then subtract 86400 seconds (24 hours) to get yesterday's midnight.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to calculate seconds since midnight directly. However, we can use the parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current date and time components.\n3. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create a timestamp for today at 00:00:00 by setting hour, minute, second to 0.\n4. Then subtract 86400 seconds (1 day) to get yesterday's 00:00:00 as lower bound.\n5. Similarly, add 86399 seconds (23:59:59) to get upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to create today's midnight timestamp. Let's see:\n\n- From current_ts, get datetime info: year, month, day, etc.\n- Then call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day, 0, 0, 0. That gives today's midnight.\n- Then subtract 86400 to get yesterday's midnight (lower bound).\n- Upper bound would be yesterday's midnight + 86399 seconds (23:59:59).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n2. Convert current_ts to datetime info (current_info).\n3. Create today_midnight_ts by calling datetime_info_to_timestamp with current_info's year, month, day, 0,0,0.\n4. yesterday_midnight_ts = today_midnight_ts - 86400.\n5. yesterday_end_ts = yesterday_midnight_ts + 86399.\n\nThen use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound = yesterday_midnight_ts and upperbound = yesterday_end_ts.\n\nBut to do this, I need to make multiple function calls.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that result to get the current date parts.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with those date parts but hour=0, minute=0, second=0 to get today's midnight.\n\nThen shift that by -1 day (or subtract 86400) to get yesterday's midnight.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function can shift by days. So after getting today_midnight_ts, shift by days=-1 to get yesterday_midnight_ts.\n\nThen, upper bound is yesterday_midnight_ts + 86399.\n\nBut how to compute 86399? Maybe shift_timestamp with days=0, hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on yesterday_midnight_ts with hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59 to get the upper bound.\n\nBut the user might not have created the reminder exactly at 23:59:59, but the upper bound should be inclusive. Wait, the search_reminder function's parameters are lowerbound and upperbound, which are probably inclusive or exclusive? The description says \"range matching timestamp with upperbound or lowerbound\", but not sure. To be safe, set upperbound as the end of the day.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info to get today's date.\n\nThen, create a timestamp for today at 00:00:00.\n\nThen, shift back one day to get yesterday at 00:00:00.\n\nThen, shift that by 23h59m59s to get the end of yesterday.\n\nWait, but maybe easier to calculate the lower and upper bounds as:\n\nlower = today_midnight_ts - 86400\n\nupper = lower + 86399\n\nBut 86400 seconds is a day, so 86400 -1 = 86399.\n\nSo, after getting today_midnight_ts, subtract 86400 to get yesterday's start, then add 86399 to get yesterday's end.\n\nBut how to get today_midnight_ts?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp → current_ts.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts → current_info (contains year, month, day, hour, min, sec).\n\n3. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=current_info['year'], month=current_info['month'], day=current_info['day'], hour=0, min=0, sec=0 → today_midnight_ts.\n\n4. Then, lower_bound = today_midnight_ts - 864",
