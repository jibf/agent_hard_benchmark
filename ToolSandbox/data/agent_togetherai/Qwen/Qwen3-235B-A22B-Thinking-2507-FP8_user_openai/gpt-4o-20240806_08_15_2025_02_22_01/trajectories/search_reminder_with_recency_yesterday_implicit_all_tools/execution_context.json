                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" Hmm, so they want to know their to-do list from yesterday.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are available. Looking at the tools provided, there's a search_reminder function. Reminders might be similar to todos, right? The user might be using reminders as their to-do items.\n\nThe search_reminder function allows searching by reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. Since they want yesterday's todos, I need to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday.\n\nWait, but how do I get the current timestamp? There's a get_current_timestamp function. So first, I should call that to know the current time. Then, figure out the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nBut the user didn't specify a time zone, but maybe the system uses the local time based on their location. However, the get_current_timestamp probably gives UTC. Hmm, but without knowing the user's time zone, it's tricky. But maybe the system handles it internally, so I can proceed with UTC.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Calculate yesterday's start and end timestamps. For example, if today is day X, yesterday is X-1 day. So subtract 24 hours from current timestamp to get start of yesterday, but actually, need to get the exact start (midnight) and end (next midnight) of yesterday.\n\nWait, but to get the exact start of yesterday, maybe subtract one day from current timestamp and set hours, minutes, seconds to 0. But how to do that without datetime functions?\n\nAlternatively, use the get_current_timestamp, then shift it back by one day to get a timestamp in yesterday, then find the start and end of that day.\n\nWait, there's a shift_timestamp function. So if I get current timestamp, shift it back by one day, then set the time to 00:00:00 for the start, and 23:59:59 for the end.\n\nBut how to set the time to midnight? Maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp. Wait, but to use that, I need to know the year, month, day, etc.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info, subtract one day from the date, then convert back to timestamp for start and end.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX.\n\nSuppose the current timestamp is T.\n\nThen, to find yesterday's start (midnight) and end (next midnight):\n\n- Subtract one day from T to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n- Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0 for start time.\n- Convert that datetime to timestamp for start.\n- Similarly, set hour to 23, minute 59, second 59 for end time.\n\nBut how to do this with the available functions?\n\nWait, there's datetime_info_to_timestamp which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current date and time.\n3. Subtract one day from the current date (if day is 1, adjust month and year accordingly, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle this).\n   - Alternatively, use shift_timestamp on T by -1 day to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n4. Convert that shifted timestamp to datetime info, then set time to 00:00:00 for start of yesterday.\n5. Convert that to timestamp (start_ts).\n6. Similarly, set time to 23:59:59 for end of yesterday (end_ts).\n7. Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound=start_ts and upperbound=end_ts.\n\nBut the user is asking for \"yesterday\", which is a 24-hour period. However, depending on time zones, but assuming the system uses the user's local time.\n\nWait, but the user might not have set their time zone, but the functions like get_current_location might help, but the user hasn't provided location yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's default is UTC. But the user's \"yesterday\" would be based on their local time.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then calculate the start and end of yesterday in the user's local time.\n\nBut without knowing the user's time zone, it's hard. However, the get_current_location function can provide latitude and longitude, which can be used to determine the time zone. But that's multiple steps.\n\nWait, the user's question is straightforward: \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So the assistant needs to find reminders (todos) that are set for yesterday.\n\nAssuming that the reminders have a reminder_timestamp, which is when the user wants to be reminded. So if the user set a reminder for yesterday's date, then searching for reminders with reminder_timestamp between the start and end of yesterday.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Calculate start and end of yesterday (in the user's local time).\n- Search reminders where reminder_timestamp is between start and end.\n\nBut to calculate start and end of yesterday, need to know the user's local time.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking about \"yesterday\", which is relative to their current day, maybe the system uses the device's local time, so the current timestamp from get_current_timestamp is in the user's local time.\n\nWait, but POSIX timestamps are UTC. So get_current_timestamp returns UTC. To get local time, need to adjust for time zone.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then shift it back by 24 hours to get a timestamp in yesterday, then find the start and end of that day.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current UTC time (T).\n2. Use shift_timestamp to subtract 1 day from T, resulting in T_yesterday.\n3. Convert T_yesterday to datetime_info to get the date (year, month, day).\n4. Set hour=0, minute=0, second=0 for start of yesterday (local time? But UTC).\n   - Wait, if T is UTC, then yesterday in UTC might not align with the user's local yesterday.\n   - This is a problem because the user's \"yesterday\" depends on their time zone.\n\nBut without knowing the time zone, it's impossible to accurately determine the start and end of the user's yesterday.\n\nHmm. Maybe the system assumes that the user's local time is the same as the device's time, which is handled internally. So when the user says \"yesterday\", the system interprets it in their local time.\n\nBut how to get the local time's start and end of yesterday?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the get_current_location to find the time zone, but that's multiple steps and the user hasn't provided location yet.\n\nWait, the user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on time zone, but the assistant can't assume. However, the user is likely referring to their local time.\n\nGiven the tools available, the assistant can:\n\n- Get current timestamp (UTC).\n- Get current location to determine time zone offset.\n- Adjust UTC timestamp to local time.\n- Calculate start and end of yesterday in local time.\n- Convert back to UTC timestamps for the search.\n\nBut this requires multiple function calls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's reminder timestamps are stored in UTC, but the user's \"yesterday\" is in their local time. So to find reminders set for yesterday in local time, need to convert local yesterday's start/end to UTC.\n\nThis is complex, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get current UTC time.\n\nThen, call get_current_location to get latitude and longitude.\n\nThen, use search_lat_lon to get the time zone for that location.\n\nWait, but search_lat_lon returns address information, not time zone. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the get_location_service_status might not help. Wait, there's a search_weather_around_lat_lon which includes timezone in the results. So:\n\n1. Get current location (lat, lon).\n2. Search weather around that lat, lon to get timezone.\n3. Use the timezone to adjust UTC to local time.\n\nBut this is getting too many steps, and the user just asked for yesterday's todos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system stores reminder_timestamp in the user's local time, so the assistant can calculate based on current local time.\n\nBut without knowing the time zone, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can assume that the user's device time is correct, and that \"yesterday\" refers to the previous day in the device's local time. So the current timestamp from get_current is in UTC, but the device time is local. So to get the local time, we need to know the time zone offset.\n\nBut how to get the time zone offset? Maybe by getting the current location and then using a service to find the time zone, but the tools don't have a direct function for that.\n\nAlternatively, the search_weather_around_lat_lon function returns timezone information. So:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get lat, lon.\n2. Call search_weather_around_lat_lon with those lat, lon to get the timezone.\n3. Use the timezone to convert current UTC to local time.\n4. Calculate start and end of yesterday in local time.\n5. Convert those local times back to UTC timestamps.\n6. Call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those UTC timestamps.\n\nThis is a lot, but necessary to accurately determine the user's yesterday.\n\nSo first step: get current location.\n\nBut the user's",
