They want to know the lowest temperature expected on the upcoming Friday. But looking at the tools provided, I don't see any functions related to weather data. Let me check the list again.\n\nThe available functions include things like contact management, message sending, currency conversion, location services, reminders, timestamp conversions, etc. There's search_lat_lon, which gets an address from coordinates, and calculate_lat_lon_distance, but nothing about weather. The user is asking for temperature, which would typically require a weather API, but none of the provided tools can retrieve weather information.\n\nWait, maybe there's a function I missed. Let me go through each one again. The functions are: add_contact, modify_contact, remove_contact, search_contacts, get_cellular_service_status, search_messages, send_message_with_phone_number, convert_currency, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, search_lat_lon, add_reminder, modify_reminder, remove_reminder, search_reminder, get_low_battery_mode_status, set_cellular_service_status, set_location_service_status, set_low_battery_mode_status, set_wifi_status, calculate_lat_lon_distance, datetime_info_to_timestamp, search_holiday, seconds_to_hours_minutes_seconds, shift_timestamp, timestamp_diff, timestamp_to_datetime_info, unit_conversion.\n\nHmm, unit_conversion can convert between units like Celsius to Fahrenheit, but that's only if we have the temperature value already. The user is asking for the actual temperature data, which isn't provided by any tool here. There's no function to get current weather or forecast data.\n\nSo, since none of the available tools can retrieve temperature information, I should inform the user that I can't help with that request using the provided functions. I need to point out that the necessary tool isn't available here.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to weather data or temperature information through the provided tools. None of the available functions (contact management, messaging, reminders, location services, timestamp utilities, etc.) can retrieve weather forecasts or temperature readings. Would you like me to help with something that can be addressed using the available tools?"
