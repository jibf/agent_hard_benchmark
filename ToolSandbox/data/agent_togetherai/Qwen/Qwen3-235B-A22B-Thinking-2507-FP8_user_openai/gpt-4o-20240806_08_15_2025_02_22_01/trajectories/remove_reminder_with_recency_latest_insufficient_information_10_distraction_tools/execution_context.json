                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to remove their upcoming reminder. Let me see. First, I need to figure out which reminder they're talking about. The problem is, they just said \"upcoming,\" but there might be multiple reminders. The system doesn't know which one is the upcoming one without more info.\n\nLooking at the tools available, there's the search_reminder function. Maybe I should use that to find the upcoming reminder first. Upcoming probably means the one with the nearest reminder_timestamp that's after the current time. But to do that, I need to know the current timestamp. Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get the current time. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the search_reminder can take a lower bound for reminder_timestamp. If I can get the current time as a POSIX timestamp, I could set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to that. But how do I get the current time? The user didn't provide it. Oh, but maybe the system has access to the current time implicitly. Wait, the tools don't include a function to get the current time. So maybe I need to assume that the current time is known, or perhaps the search_reminder can be used with some parameters.\n\nWait, the user says \"upcoming,\" which is vague. Without knowing which specific reminder, I can't just remove it. The remove_reminder function requires a reminder_id. So I need to first find the reminder_id of the upcoming reminder.\n\nSo the correct approach is to first call search_reminder with parameters that would find the next upcoming reminder. But to do that, I need to set a lower bound for reminder_timestamp as the current time. But since I don't have the current time, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as now. However, the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp. Wait, maybe the search_reminder can be called without specific bounds, but then it might return multiple results.\n\nWait, the user said \"upcoming,\" which is singular, so maybe they have only one upcoming reminder. But I can't assume that. The safe way is to search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is after now, and then pick the earliest one. But without knowing the current time, how?\n\nWait, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the lower bound. But since I can't compute that without a function, perhaps the search_reminder function can handle it if I don't specify a lower bound, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to ask for clarification. The initial instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because \"upcoming\" isn't specific enough. There could be multiple reminders, and without knowing which one, I can't remove it. So according to the instructions, I should ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.\n\nWait, but the user might expect the assistant to figure out the next upcoming one. However, the tools require a reminder_id for removal. Since the user hasn't provided it, and the assistant can't determine it without more info, the correct action is to ask the user to specify which reminder they want to remove, perhaps by providing the reminder ID or more details.\n\nSo the answer should be a request for clarification, not a tool call. Because the user didn't specify which reminder, and the system can't safely assume which one is \"upcoming\" without more data.\n</think>\n\nI need more information to remove your upcoming reminder. Could you please specify:\n1. The exact reminder ID, OR\n2. More details about the reminder (e.g., content, time, or location) so I can identify which one you mean?\n\nWithout this information, I cannot safely determine which reminder you want to remove.",
