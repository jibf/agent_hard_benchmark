                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. But wait, I don't know the current date. Oh, right, there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give me the current POSIX timestamp. So I should call that first to get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can calculate tomorrow's date. Tomorrow is one day from now. So using the shift_timestamp function, I can add 1 day to the current timestamp. Wait, but the user said tomorrow at 5 PM. So maybe I need to set the time to 17:00 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24-hour format). Hmm, but how do I adjust the time specifically to 5 PM tomorrow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But for that, I need the exact year, month, day, hour, etc. So if I get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then add one day, set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0. But I need to handle the date correctly, like if tomorrow is the next month or year.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach: get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, but then adjust the time to 17:00. Wait, shifting by 1 day would take the current time and add 24 hours, but the user wants exactly 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of the current time. So if it's 3 PM today, shifting 1 day would make it 3 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So that's not correct.\n\nSo perhaps the right way is to take the current date, find tomorrow's date, set the time to 17:00:00, then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nTo do that, I need to get the current datetime info. So first, call get_current_timestamp to get the current timestamp, then use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current year, month, day, etc. Then add one day to the day, making sure to handle month/year rollover. Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that datetime info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the user might not have specified the timezone, but since POSIX timestamps are UTC, but maybe the user is in their local timezone. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we assume the user's local time, but POSIX timestamps are UTC. Hmm, this could be a problem. However, the functions provided don't mention timezone handling, so maybe we proceed under the assumption that the user's local time is being used, and the conversion functions handle it appropriately. Or maybe the functions expect UTC. This is a bit ambiguous, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the given tools.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date: add 1 day to current day, handling month/year changes if needed.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0 for 5 PM.\n5. Convert that datetime info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n6. Use add_reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\" and the calculated timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if today is, say, October 5th, 10 AM, then tomorrow is October 6th at 5 PM. So regardless of the current time, we need to set the reminder for the next day at 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime_info.\n- Increment day by 1, adjusting month/year if necessary.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the day increment? For example, if current day is 31st of a month with 31 days, adding 1 day would roll over to next month.\n\nBut since the tools don't have a function to do date arithmetic directly, except shift_timestamp which can add days, but that adds 24-hour periods. Wait, shift_timestamp can add days as a parameter. Wait, the shift_timestamp function has parameters for weeks, days, hours, etc. So if I take the current timestamp, and shift it by 1 day, that would give me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of the current time.\n\nWait, no. For example, if it's 10 AM today, shifting by 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, which is 7 hours after 10 AM. So shifting by 1 day and 7 hours? But that depends on the current time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to set the time to 17:00 on the next day. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime_info.\n- Set day = day +1, then set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the day increment properly. For example, if current day is 31, month=1 (Jan), adding 1 day would be 32, which is invalid. So need to adjust month and day accordingly.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to do that. The shift_timestamp function can handle adding days correctly, considering month/year changes. Because shift_timestamp's description says it shifts the timestamp by the given amounts, so adding 1 day would correctly handle rolling over to next month.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function's parameters include days, so if I take the current timestamp, and shift it by 1 day, that would give me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, not same time tomorrow.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: get the current timestamp, then shift it to the next day at 5 PM. But how?\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, convert to datetime_info, then set the hour to 17, and add 1 day if the current time is past 5 PM. Wait, but the user said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of current time, it's tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nWait, suppose today is Monday. If the user says \"tomorrow 5 PM\", it's Tuesday 5 PM, even if it's already past 5 PM on Monday. Wait, no. If it's 6 PM on Monday, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" would be Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later. But if the user says \"tomorrow\" at 6 PM Monday, they probably mean the next day's 5 PM, which is Tuesday 5 PM.\n\nSo regardless of current time, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" is the next day at 17:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get current date and time.\n3. Set the time to 17:00:00.\n4. If the resulting datetime is before the current time (i.e., if current time is past 5 PM today), then add 1 day.\nWait, no. Because \"tomorrow\" means the next day, so even if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is the next day's 5 PM.\n\nWait, no. If it's 6 PM Monday, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" would be Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later. So regardless of current time, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" is the next calendar day at 5 PM.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- Take today's date, add 1 day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_datetime = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_timestamp)\n\ntarget_datetime = {\n  year: current_datetime.year,\n  month: current_datetime.month,\n  day: current_datetime.day +1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut need to handle if day+1 exceeds the days in the month. For example, if current day is 31, month=1 (Jan), then day+1=32, which is invalid. So need to roll over to February 1.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to do that. However, the shift_timestamp function can handle adding days correctly. So perhaps:\n\nTake current_timestamp, shift by 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, shifting by 1 day would give same time tomorrow. Then, to set the time to 17:00, we can calculate the difference between current hour and 17, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCalculate the target date as today +1 day, time 17:00:00.\n\nTo get that timestamp:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime_info.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut step 3 may result in an invalid date (e.g., day 32 in a 31-day month). However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle that by normalizing the date. Wait, but the function's description doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the shift_timestamp function is the right way to add days correctly",
