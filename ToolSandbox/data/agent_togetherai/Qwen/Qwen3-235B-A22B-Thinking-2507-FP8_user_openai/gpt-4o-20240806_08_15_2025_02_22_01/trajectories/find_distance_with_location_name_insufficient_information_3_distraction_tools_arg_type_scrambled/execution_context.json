But they didn't provide those. The tools available include calculate_lat_lon_distance, which requires two sets of coordinates. So first, I need to get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. Wait, there's also search_lat_lon, but that's for getting an address from coordinates. Maybe I should use another method to find the bridge's coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates are known. Let me think. The bridge is in San Francisco. The approximate coordinates are 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W. But I shouldn't assume; maybe I should verify. However, the user hasn't given their own coordinates. The problem is the user's location isn't provided. So I can't calculate the distance without knowing where they are. \n\nThe tools available don't include a function to get the user's current location. The user might be expecting me to ask for their coordinates. Since the question is ambiguous without their location, I should request clarification. The instructions say not to make assumptions, so I shouldn't plug in any values. Therefore, I need to ask the user to provide their current latitude and longitude so I can use the calculate_lat_lon_distance function with the bridge's coordinates. But wait, do I know the bridge's coordinates? Maybe I can look them up via another tool. Wait, the search_lat_lon function takes lat/lon to get an address, but not the other way around. There's no function to get coordinates from an address. Hmm. So perhaps I need to know the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates beforehand. Since the user is asking about distance, I need both points. But without the user's location, I can't proceed. So the correct step is to ask the user for their current latitude and longitude. Alternatively, maybe the system has access to their location, but the problem states not to assume. Therefore, the assistant should prompt the user to provide their current coordinates.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the distance from your current location to the Golden Gate Bridge, I'll need your current latitude and longitude coordinates. Could you please share your current coordinates (latitude and longitude)? \n\n<note>\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's approximate coordinates are 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W, but I require your location to compute the distance.\n</note>",

So the assistant can't get it automatically. The previous response asked for their coordinates, but they said they don't know. So the next step is to explain how they can find their coordinates, maybe via a map app or GPS device.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting a different approach. But without their coordinates, the distance can't be calculated. So the correct response is to explain they need to obtain their current latitude and longitude first, perhaps by checking their device's location services or using a mapping application.\n\nI should make sure not to assume any values. The user might not have a way to get the coordinates, but the assistant can't proceed without them. So the answer should guide them on how to find their coordinates, not make up numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine your distance from the Golden Gate Bridge, you'll need to obtain your current latitude and longitude coordinates. Here's how you can find them:\n\n1. **On a smartphone**: Open Google Maps, tap your location dot, and your coordinates will appear at the bottom.\n2. **On a computer**: Right-click your location on Google Maps and copy the coordinates from the pop-up menu.\n\nOnce you have these values (e.g., `latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194`), I can calculate the exact distance to the Golden Gate Bridge (approximately 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W). Would you like to share your coordinates once you find them?",

If you're unable to access location services, you could estimate your position by:\n\n- Sharing your **city or general area** (e.g., \"I'm in downtown San Francisco\"), and I can approximate the distance from there.\n- Using a known landmark or address near you (e.g., \"I'm at Fisherman's Wharf\"), and I can look up its coordinates first.\n\nWould you like to try either of these alternatives?",

The tools available include calculating distance between two lat/long points, but without the user's coordinates, that's impossible. The other functions like searching for a stock or holiday don't seem relevant here.\n\nThe user has already said they can't get their location through any means. Maybe they're in a situation where they're lost or don't have access to their device's location features. But without any coordinates, there's no data to plug into the calculate_lat_lon_distance function.\n\nI should check if there's a default location or if the system might have stored previous location data, but the problem states not to make assumptions. The user hasn't provided any prior location info in the conversation history.\n\nWait, the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates are known (37.8199° N, 122.4783° W). If the user could provide even a rough estimate, like being in San Francisco, I could use a central point. But they said they don't know the city either.\n\nHmm, maybe they're testing the system's limits? Or perhaps they're in a scenario where they genuinely don't know their location. In that case, the only honest answer is that without coordinates, distance can't be calculated. The assistant should inform them that it's not possible and maybe suggest alternative ways if they can get any location info later.\n\nNo tools can be called here because the required parameters (user's lat/long) are missing. The response should state that clearly and offer help if they can provide more info later.\n</think>\n\nWithout any location information (coordinates, city, or nearby landmarks), it is **not possible** to calculate your distance to the Golden Gate Bridge. The calculation requires precise latitude and longitude values for both your location and the bridge. \n\nIf you later gain access to location services or identify your general area, feel free to share those details, and I’ll compute the distance immediately!
