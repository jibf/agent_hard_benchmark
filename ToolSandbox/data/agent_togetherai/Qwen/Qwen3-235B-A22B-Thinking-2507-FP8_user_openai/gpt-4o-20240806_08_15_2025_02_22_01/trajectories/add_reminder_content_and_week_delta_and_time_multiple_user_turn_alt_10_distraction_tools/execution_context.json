                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current date and time aren't provided, I should get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nSo, I should call get_current_timestamp to know the current time. Once I have that, I can determine tomorrow's date. But wait, maybe there's a function that can help convert the date and time into a timestamp. Let me check the tools available.\n\nLooking at the functions, there's datetime_info_to_timestamp which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But to use that, I need to know tomorrow's date details. Alternatively, there's shift_timestamp which can add days to the current timestamp. Since the user said \"tomorrow,\" that's +1 day.\n\nWait, but to use shift_timestamp, I need the current timestamp. So first step: get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day and set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting by 1 day might not set the time to 5 PM. Hmm. Let's think.\n\nSuppose current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:00. Tomorrow at 5 PM would be 2023-10-06 17:00:00. So, shifting the current timestamp by 1 day would get to the same time tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM specifically. So maybe I need to calculate the exact timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe get the current timestamp, then use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but then adjust the time to 17:00:00. Wait, but shift_timestamp allows adding days, hours, etc. So if I take the current timestamp, add 1 day, then subtract the current hours, minutes, seconds, and add 17 hours. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use get_current_timestamp, then convert that to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Then, take that info, add 1 day to the day, set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0, then convert back to timestamp with datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nLet me check the available functions. Yes, timestamp_to_datetime_info can get the current date components. Then, modify the day and hour, then convert back.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add 1 to the day (but handle month/year rollover, but maybe the function handles that? Wait, no, the user has to handle it, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle adding days correctly. Wait, shift_timestamp can add days, so maybe better to use that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach: get current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, but then set the time to 17:00:00. However, shifting by 1 day would keep the same time. For example, if current time is 14:30, shifting +1 day gives tomorrow 14:30. But the user wants 17:00, so need to adjust the time.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the timestamp for today at 17:00, then if that's in the past, add 1 day. But the user said \"tomorrow,\" so regardless of current time, it's tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nWait, perhaps the safest way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = day + 1, hour = 17, minute = 0, second = 0.\n- Then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if day +1 exceeds the days in the month, etc. But the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that correctly, assuming the input values are valid. So, for example, if today is the 31st of October, adding 1 day would roll over to November 1st.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current date/time components.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute and second to 0.\n5. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new values.\n\nBut wait, the user said \"tomorrow,\" which is exactly 24 hours from now, but if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours from now. But the user probably means the next occurrence of 5 PM, which would be tomorrow if current time is before 5 PM today, or the day after if it's after. Wait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM,\" which is unambiguous as the next day's 5PM regardless of current time. Wait, no—if today is Monday and it's 6 PM, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" would be Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later. But maybe the user just means the next day at 5 PM, regardless of current time.\n\nBut the problem is, the user's instruction is to add a reminder for \"tomorrow 5PM\". So regardless of when today is, it's the next day at 17:00.\n\nSo the correct approach is to take today's date, add one day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Add 1 to day.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle month/year rollover. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should accept the incremented day and handle it correctly. For example, if current day is 31 (October), adding 1 would make it 32, but the function might not handle that. Wait, no—datetime_info_to_timestamp expects valid date components. So if the current day is 31 (October has 31 days), adding 1 would be invalid. So we need to properly increment the date.\n\nWait, perhaps using shift_timestamp is better. Let's see: get current timestamp, then shift by 1 day. But that would give the same time tomorrow. Then, if we want 5 PM, we need to adjust the time. For example, if current time is 14:30, shift +1 day gives tomorrow 14:30. Then, to get to 17:00, add 2 hours and 30 minutes. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the timestamp for today at 17:00. If that's in the past, add 24 hours. But the user said \"tomorrow,\" so it's definitely the next day's 5 PM.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp. This gives today at 5 PM.\n- If that timestamp is less than current timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's 5 PM.\n\nBut the user said \"tomorrow,\" so regardless of current time, it's tomorrow. So even if it's 4 PM today, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" is 25 hours from now. Wait, no—if it's 4 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 25 hours later. But the user probably means the next day's 5 PM, which is 24 hours plus 1 hour from current time.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's instruction is ambiguous in terms of exact calculation, but as per common understanding, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" means the 5 PM of the next calendar day.\n\nSo, for example, if today is Monday, 5 PM is Monday 17:00. Tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 17:00.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to take the current date, increment the day by 1, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute and second to 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if incrementing day goes beyond the month's days. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that correctly as long as the input is valid. Wait, but if the current day is 31 (October), adding 1 would be 32, which is invalid. So we need to properly increment the date. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives the current date components, and when we increment day by 1, we have to check if it's valid. But since the function datetime_info_to_timestamp expects valid date components, perhaps the better approach is to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to the current timestamp, then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, here's an alternative:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by 1 day to get T+1d.\n- Convert T+1d to datetime info.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut shifting by 1 day gives the same time tomorrow. So if current time is 14:30, T+1d is tomorrow 14:30. Then, changing the hour to 17",
