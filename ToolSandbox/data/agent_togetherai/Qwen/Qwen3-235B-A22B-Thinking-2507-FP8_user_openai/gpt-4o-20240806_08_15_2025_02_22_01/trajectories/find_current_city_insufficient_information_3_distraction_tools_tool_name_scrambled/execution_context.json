Let me check the tools available.\n\nFirst, there's the rapid_api_search_tools_1 function which takes latitude and longitude to get the address. But to use that, I need the coordinates. The user hasn't provided them yet. They mentioned \"Use your tools to figure it out,\" but without the coordinates, I can't call that function.\n\nThen they said, \"Try using location services or GPS on your device.\" Hmm, but as an AI, I don't have access to the user's device location. I can't activate GPS or location services. My tools require the user to input the coordinates manually.\n\nI need to explain that I can't access their location directly. The only way is if they provide the latitude and longitude. Maybe they don't realize that I need those numbers. So I should prompt them again to share the coordinates so I can use the tool to find their city.\n\nWait, the user might think I can somehow get the location through other means, but according to the tools given, there's no function for that. Only the two tools: one for geolocation lookup (needs coords) and one for stock info. So I have to stick to requesting the coordinates.\n\nI should make it clear that I can't use location services myself and need them to provide the numbers. Maybe give an example again to help them understand what to share.\n</think>\n\nI don’t have access to your device’s location services, GPS, or any personal data. As an AI, I **cannot** retrieve your coordinates automatically. \n\nTo proceed, you’ll need to **manually share your latitude and longitude** (e.g., \"37.7749, -122.4194\") so I can use the geolocation tool to identify your city. Without this input, I cannot complete the request. \n\nLet me know if you’d like guidance on how to find your coordinates! 🌍",

Hmm, I need to remember that I don't have access to their device's GPS. The tools provided require latitude and longitude inputs. \n\nIn the previous messages, I explained that I can't access their location and need them to provide the coordinates. They're still insisting I \"try turning on GPS,\" which I can't do. Maybe they don't understand that I can't access their device.\n\nI should reiterate that I need them to manually give the coordinates. Maybe they don't know how to get them. Should I offer instructions on finding their latitude and longitude? Like checking phone settings or using Google Maps?\n\nWait, the user might be frustrated. They want a quick answer, but without the coordinates, I can't use the tool. I need to be clear but helpful. Let me check the tools again. The first function is rapid_api_search_tools_1, which needs lat and long. \n\nSince the user isn't providing the numbers, I can't call the tool. My response should stress that I need those specific numbers. Maybe give an example again. Like, \"If you're in New York, your coordinates might be 40.7128, -74.0060.\" But I shouldn't assume their location.\n\nAlso, the user might not know how to get their coordinates. Maybe add a tip: \"Open Google Maps, tap and hold your location, and the coordinates will appear.\" But I have to be careful not to give incorrect instructions for their device.\n\nWait, the main point is I can't proceed without the numbers. So the response should be firm but helpful, repeating the need for lat and long. No tool calls can be made here because the required parameters aren't provided. So the assistant should prompt again for the coordinates.\n</think>\n\nI understand you're asking me to determine your location, but **I cannot access GPS, location services, or any device data**—this is a technical limitation of my design. To use the geolocation tool (`rapid_api_search_tools_1`), I **require explicit latitude and longitude values** (e.g., `37.7749, -122.4194`). \n\nIf you’re unsure how to find your coordinates:\n1. **On Google Maps**: Tap and hold your location → Coordinates appear in the search bar.\n2. **On iPhone**: Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services (ensure it’s on), then use Maps to find your pin.\n3. **On Android**: Open Google Maps > Tap your blue location dot → Coordinates appear at the bottom.\n\nOnce you share the numbers, I’ll immediately look up your city! 🌍",

No tool calls can be made because the required parameters aren't provided.\n\nNo function can be called here since the user hasn't given lat/long.
