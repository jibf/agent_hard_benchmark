                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked \"Who are my friends?\" and I called the search_contacts function with relationship set to \"friend\". The response came back with two contacts: Fredrik Thordendal and John Petrucci.\n\nNow I need to present this information clearly. Let me check the data. Both have person_id, name, phone number, relationship as friend, and is_self is False. So they are friends of the user, not the user themselves.\n\nI should list their names and maybe phone numbers. The user might want to know who their friends are in the contact list. Since the question is straightforward, a simple list should suffice. Let me format it as a response.\n\nWait, should I include phone numbers? The user didn't specify, but since it's about contacts, maybe including the numbers is helpful. Let me see. The original function response includes phone numbers, so it's safe to include them. But maybe the user just wants names. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the user's question: \"Who are my friends?\" They might just need the names. However, in a contacts context, phone numbers are part of the contact info. Maybe present both names and numbers. Let me check the example response from the tool. The tool response includes both, so I should probably include them.\n\nSo, structure the answer as a list of friends with their names and phone numbers. Make it clear and concise. Also, confirm that these are the friends found. Let me write that out.\n</think>\n\nYour friends in contacts are:\n- **Fredrik Thordendal** (+12453344098)\n- **John Petrucci** (+1234560987)",

I need to make sure I handle this correctly.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the previous interaction, the user had two contacts: Fredrik and John, both with person IDs. When they wanted to change them to enemies, I called modify_contact for each ID with relationship \"enemy\". Now, they want to revert that.\n\nSo, the same person IDs should be used again. The user didn't specify any new information, so I should use the same IDs as before. The response from the tool calls was \"None\", which probably means the updates were successful. Now, updating back to \"friend\" requires two modify_contact calls with each person_id and relationship set to \"friend\".\n\nI need to check if there are any other parameters needed, but the required one is person_id. The relationship is being changed, so including that in the arguments is necessary. No other fields are mentioned, so just those two parameters per call.\n\nWait, the user said \"update them back to friends\", so only the relationship needs to change. The other fields like name or phone number aren't mentioned, so we don't need to include them. Just the person_id and the new relationship.\n\nI should generate two tool calls, one for each person_id, setting relationship to \"friend\". The previous tool calls for changing to enemies used those IDs, so they should still be valid.\n\nMake sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the right person IDs. Let me double-check the IDs from the earlier tool_response. Yes, they were '9e137f06...' and 'a22e1984...'.\n\nNo other parameters are required except person_id, but since we're modifying the relationship, including it in the arguments is necessary. The function allows for optional parameters, so specifying relationship here is correct.\n\nAlright, the tool calls should be correct. Let me structure the response with the two modify_contact functions.\n</think>\n\nYour contacts have been reverted. **Fredrik Thordendal** and **John Petrucci** are now marked as *friends* again in your contacts list. 😊",
