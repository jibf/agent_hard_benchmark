                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to postpone their most recent reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"most recent reminder\" means. That probably refers to the reminder with the latest creation timestamp. So I should search for reminders, maybe sort them by creation time to find the most recent one.\n\nThe function search_reminder can help here. But to get the most recent, I might need to set parameters that retrieve all reminders and then sort them. Wait, the search_reminder function allows specifying lower and upper bounds for creation_timestamp. But without knowing the exact timestamps, maybe I should retrieve all reminders and then process them.\n\nWait, but the user says \"most recent,\" so maybe the one with the highest creation_timestamp. So I need to get all reminders, order them by creation_timestamp descending, and take the first one.\n\nBut the search_reminder function doesn't have a parameter for sorting. Hmm. The description says \"Search results contains all reminder entries that matched all criteria.\" So maybe without any criteria, it returns all reminders. Then the system would return all, and I can pick the most recent.\n\nSo first step: call search_reminder with no parameters to get all reminders. Then find the one with the latest creation_timestamp.\n\nOnce I have that reminder's ID, I need to modify it to set the reminder_timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut how do I get tomorrow's 5 PM as a timestamp?\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then calculate tomorrow's date. Wait, but 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_time).\n2. Find the most recent reminder (highest creation_timestamp).\n3. Calculate new reminder time: tomorrow at 5 PM. So current_time + 1 day + (17 hours - current hour, but need to handle date properly).\n\nWait, better to use shift_timestamp. If current timestamp is, say, today at 3 PM, then adding 1 day would be tomorrow 3 PM, but we need 5 PM. So maybe shift by 1 day and then adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, set the time to 17:00 (5 PM) of the next day.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on current_ts to get current date and time.\n- Then, create a new datetime for tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n- Convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle \"tomorrow\"? If today is the 15th, tomorrow is 16th. So increment day by 1, but handle month/year rollover.\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by 1 day, then adjust the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day might not account for DST or other time changes, but maybe the shift_timestamp function handles that.\n\nWait, shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc. So to get tomorrow at 5 PM:\n\nIf current time is, say, 2023-10-05 14:30:00, then tomorrow 17:00:00 is 2023-10-06 17:00:00.\n\nSo the difference is (1 day + 2 hours + 30 minutes). But that's specific to current time.\n\nBut the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", regardless of current time. So it's always the next day at 17:00.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift by 1 day to get tomorrow's date at same time.\n- Then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? Maybe set the hour to 17, minute and second to 0.\n\nWait, but shifting by days and then modifying the time components.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, add 1 day, then set the time part to 17:00:00.\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, but to set the exact time, maybe need to calculate the target timestamp.\n\nAnother approach: get the current timestamp, convert to datetime info, increment the day by 1, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems more precise.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime components.\n3. Increment day by 1 (handle month/year if needed, but the function might handle that).\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert that new datetime to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut wait, incrementing day by 1 could cause issues if the current day is the last day of the month. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that when converting back.\n\nSo:\n\n- current_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n- new_day = current_info['day'] + 1\n- But need to check if new_day exceeds days in month, etc. But maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp will handle it when converting. Wait, no. If you have, say, January 31, adding 1 day would be February 1. But if the user just adds 1 to the day, it would be 32, which is invalid. So better to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- current_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n- tomorrow_ts = shift_timestamp(current_ts, days=1)\n- Then, convert tomorrow_ts to datetime_info, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to set the time components?\n\nAlternatively, take current_ts, add 1 day, then subtract the current time part (hours, minutes, seconds), then add 17 hours.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\ncurrent_ts -> datetime_info gives (y, m, d, h, min, sec)\n\ntarget_ts = current_ts + (24*3600) - (h*3600 + min*60 + sec) + 17*3600\n\nBut that's a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to get to midnight of tomorrow, then add 17 hours.\n\nWait, midnight of tomorrow is current_ts + 1 day - current time part.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Shift by 1 day to get tomorrow same time.\n3. Then shift by (17 - current hour) hours, but that might not be accurate if current hour is after 17.\n\nWait, no. The user wants tomorrow at 5 PM regardless of current time. So even if it's 6 PM now, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours from now.\n\nWait, but \"tomorrow 5PM\" is a specific time: the next occurrence of 5 PM after the current time.\n\nSo if current time is 2023-10-05 16:00, then tomorrow 5PM is 2023-10-06 17:00.\n\nIf current time is 2023-10-05 18:00, then tomorrow 5PM is still 2023-10-06 17:00, which is 23 hours from now.\n\nSo the correct way is to set the date to tomorrow (current date +1 day) at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = day +1.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut handling day+1 correctly (e.g., month rollover).\n\nSo first, get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date and time.\n\nThen, increment day by 1.\n\nBut need to handle cases where day+1 exceeds the number of days in the month. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that when converting back. Wait, no. If you have, say, January 31, and you set day=32, the datetime_info_to_timestamp would probably throw an error. So better to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\n\ntomorrow_midnight = shift_timestamp(current_ts, days=1, hours=-current_hour, minutes=-current_minute, seconds=-current_second)\n\nBut how to get current_hour, etc.?\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncurrent_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts)\n\ntarget_info = {\n  year: current_info.year,\n  month: current_info.month,\n  day: current_info.day + 1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut if day+1 is invalid, the datetime_info_to_timestamp will handle it? Or will it cause an error?\n\nFor example, if current day is 31 (January), then day+1=32. But datetime_info_to_timestamp might automatically roll over to February 1.\n\nAssuming that the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can handle that, then it's safe.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute and second to 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp",
