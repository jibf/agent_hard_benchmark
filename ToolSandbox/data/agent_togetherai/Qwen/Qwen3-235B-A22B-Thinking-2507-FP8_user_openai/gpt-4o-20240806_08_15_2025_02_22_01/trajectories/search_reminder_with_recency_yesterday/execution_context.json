                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what \"yesterday\" refers to. Since the user didn't specify a date, I should probably use the current date to calculate yesterday's date. To do that, I'll need the current timestamp. The get_current_timestamp function can provide that.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can shift it back by one day to get yesterday's timestamp. Wait, but the user is asking about reminders set for yesterday. Wait, maybe they want reminders that were scheduled for yesterday. So I need to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp is within yesterday's date range.\n\nWait, the user says \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So they want to know what reminders they had set for yesterday. So first, I need to find the start and end timestamps for yesterday. To do that, I need the current time, then subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then find the start (midnight) and end (next midnight) of that day.\n\nBut how to calculate that. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Let's call that now.\n\nThen, shift now back by one day to get a timestamp that's in yesterday's day. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), I need to adjust the time to 00:00:00 of that day.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Shift now back by 1 day to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n3. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get the year, month, day.\n4. Then create the lowerbound as the start of that day (00:00:00) and upperbound as the start of the next day (00:00:00 of today).\n\nWait, but how to get the exact timestamps for yesterday's start and end.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a timestamp that's yesterday at the same time, but then adjust to midnight.\n\nWait, maybe using the shift_timestamp function with days=-1, but also set hours, minutes, seconds to 0. Hmm, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, but to get the start of the day, perhaps better to convert the current timestamp to datetime info, subtract one day from the date, then set time to 00:00:00, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut the tools provided don't have a function to convert datetime info back to timestamp. Wait, the tools have timestamp_to_datetime_info, which converts timestamp to date info, but not the other way. So maybe the process is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert now to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Subtract one day from the date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Then set the time to 00:00:00 for yesterday's start, and 23:59:59 for end.\n\nBut how to get the timestamps for yesterday's start and end.\n\nAlternative approach: Use shift_timestamp to get a timestamp that's at the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Shift now back by 1 day, then set hours, minutes, seconds to 0 to get start of yesterday.\n- But the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()\n\nstart_of_yesterday = shift_timestamp(current_timestamp, days=-1, hours=0, minutes=0, seconds=0) Wait no, shifting by days=-1 from current time would give a time 24 hours ago. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe better to:\n\ncurrent_time = get_current_timestamp()\n\nConvert current_time to datetime info. Let's say today is 2023-10-05 14:30:00.\n\nThen, subtract 1 day to get 2023-10-04. Then set time to 00:00:00 for start, and 23:59:59 for end.\n\nBut how to compute the timestamps for start and end.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert now to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Subtract 1 from the day to get yesterday's date.\n4. Create a timestamp for yesterday 00:00:00 (lowerbound) and 23:59:59 (upperbound).\n\nBut to do that, need to convert yesterday's date at 00:00:00 to timestamp. However, the tools don't have a function to convert date info to timestamp. So maybe:\n\nUse shift_timestamp to get the start of today, then subtract one day.\n\nWait, how to get start of today:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()\n\nConvert to datetime info, then shift back hours, minutes, seconds to 0.\n\nBut without a function to set time, maybe:\n\nTake current_timestamp, shift it back hours=current_hour, minutes=current_minute, seconds=current_second to get start of today.\n\nBut how to get current_hour, etc. So:\n\nCall timestamp_to_datetime_info on current_timestamp to get current hour, minute, etc.\n\nThen shift current_timestamp by hours=-current_hour, minutes=-current_minute, seconds=-current_second to get start of today.\n\nThen start of yesterday is start_of_today minus 24 hours.\n\nSimilarly, end of yesterday is start_of_today minus 1 second.\n\nWait, start_of_today is 00:00:00 today.\n\nSo start_of_yesterday = start_of_today - 24 hours.\n\nend_of_yesterday = start_of_today - 1 second.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert now to datetime info to get current hour, minute, second.\n3. Shift now by -hours, -minutes, -seconds to get start of today.\n4. Shift start_of_today by -24 hours to get start_of_yesterday.\n5. Shift start_of_today by -1 second to get end_of_yesterday.\n\nBut the tools have shift_timestamp function which can shift by days, hours, etc.\n\nWait, to get start_of_today:\n\ncurrent_time = get_current_timestamp()\n\ndatetime_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_time)\n\nhours = datetime_info['hour']\n\nminutes = datetime_info['minute']\n\nseconds = datetime_info['second']\n\nstart_of_today = shift_timestamp(current_time, hours=-hours, minutes=-minutes, seconds=-seconds)\n\nThen start_of_yesterday = shift_timestamp(start_of_today, days=-1)\n\nend_of_yesterday = shift_timestamp(start_of_today, seconds=-1)\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nSo the process requires multiple steps:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen convert to datetime info to get current time components.\n\nShift current time to start of today.\n\nThen shift start of today back 1 day for start of yesterday.\n\nShift start of today back 1 second for end of yesterday.\n\nThen use those as reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound in search_reminder.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nThen call shift_timestamp for start_of_today.\n\nThen shift again for start_of_yesterday and end_of_yesterday.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for reminders that were set for yesterday, so the reminder_timestamp should be between start_of_yesterday and end_of_yesterday.\n\nSo the search_reminder function needs reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those values.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current time.\n3. Shift current timestamp back by hours, minutes, seconds to get start of today.\n4. Shift start of today back 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n5. Shift start of today back 1 second to get end of yesterday.\n6. Search reminders with reminder_timestamp between start_of_yesterday and end_of_yesterday.\n\nBut each shift requires a function call.\n\nSo first, need to get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that timestamp to datetime info to get the current hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, shift the current timestamp by negative hours, minutes, seconds to get start of today.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function allows shifting by deltas. So to get start of today, subtract the current hour, minute, second.\n\nFor example, if current time is 14:30:45, then shift by hours=-14, minutes=-30, seconds=-45.\n\nSo the parameters would be hours= -current_hour, etc.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, call shift_timestamp with timestamp=current_timestamp, hours=-current_hour, minutes=-current_minute, seconds=-current_second to get start_of_today.\n\nThen, call shift_timestamp on start_of_today with days=-1 to get start_of_yesterday.\n\nThen, call shift_timestamp on start_of_today with seconds=-1 to get end_of_yesterday.\n\nThen, use start_of_yesterday as reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and end_of_yesterday as upperbound in search_reminder.\n\nSo let's outline the tool calls needed:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp() → returns current_ts\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=current_ts) → returns datetime_info\n3. shift_timestamp(timestamp=current_ts, hours=-datetime_info.hour, minutes=-datetime_info.minute, seconds=-datetime_info.second) → start_of_today\n4. shift_timestamp(timestamp=start_of_today, days=-1) → start_of_yesterday\n5. shift_timestamp(timestamp=start_of_today, seconds=-1)",
