                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So first, I need to figure out what yesterday's date is based on the current timestamp.\n\nThe user's current timestamp was provided as 1755254239.669515, which when converted using utilities_7 gives the date 2025-08-15 (since year 2025, month 8, day 15). So today is August 15, 2025. Therefore, yesterday would be August 14, 2025.\n\nNow, to find reminders from yesterday, I need to set up a search for reminders created or set for that day. The reminder_3 function allows searching with timestamp ranges. But I need to determine whether the user is asking about reminders created yesterday or reminders that were scheduled for yesterday.\n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous. \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" could mean either reminders that were set to trigger yesterday or reminders created yesterday. However, typically, when someone asks what was on their reminder yesterday, they probably mean reminders that were scheduled to go off yesterday.\n\nSo, I need to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp is within yesterday's date range. To do that, I need the POSIX timestamps for the start and end of August 14, 2025.\n\nFirst, let's get the start of yesterday (August 14, 00:00:00) and the end of yesterday (August 14, 23:59:59.999...). To get these timestamps, I can use the current timestamp and shift it back by one day.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp is 2025-08-15 06:37:19. So yesterday is 2025-08-14. Let's calculate the start and end timestamps for that day.\n\nAlternatively, use utilities_1 to convert August 14, 2025, 00:00:00 to a timestamp, and August 14, 2025, 23:59:59 to another timestamp.\n\nBut since the user might not have specified the time, maybe the reminder is set for the entire day. So, the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound would be the start of the day (midnight) and upperbound would be the end of the day (just before midnight next day).\n\nSo, first, I need to create the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's date.\n\nLet me use utilities_1 to get the timestamp for August 14, 2025, 00:00:00.\n\nParameters for utilities_1: year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, the upper bound would be August 14, 2025, 23:59:59. So utilities_1 with hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to calculate the start of the day and then add 24 hours for the end. Alternatively, use utilities_5 to shift the start timestamp by 24 hours to get the end.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, call utilities_1 for the start of yesterday:\n\nyear=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, get that timestamp, and then the upper bound would be that timestamp + 86399 seconds (23h59m59s), but perhaps it's easier to calculate the next day's start and subtract a second.\n\nAlternatively, use utilities_5 to shift the start timestamp by 1 day to get the start of the next day, then set upper bound as that minus 1 second.\n\nBut maybe the simplest way is to use utilities_1 for both start and end.\n\nWait, but the user's current date is 2025-08-15. So yesterday is 2025-08-14.\n\nSo, let's call utilities_1 for 2025-08-14 00:00:00 to get the lower bound.\n\nThen, utilities_1 for 2025-08-14 23:59:59 to get the upper bound.\n\nWait, but utilities_1 requires all parameters. So for the lower bound, it's 2025, 8, 14, 0, 0, 0.\n\nFor the upper bound, 2025, 8, 14, 23, 59, 59.\n\nSo I need to make two calls to utilities_1 to get both timestamps.\n\nWait, but maybe I can calculate the upper bound by adding 86399 seconds to the lower bound. But perhaps it's safer to use utilities_1 for both.\n\nAlternatively, once I have the lower bound timestamp, I can use utilities_5 to add 23 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds.\n\nBut let's see. Let's first get the lower bound.\n\nSo first, call utilities_1 with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, get that timestamp, say T_start.\n\nThen, the upper bound would be T_start + 86399 (since 24*3600 -1 = 86399).\n\nBut maybe the system expects the upper bound to be exclusive, so up to but not including the next day's start. So if the reminder is set for the entire day, the upper bound would be the start of the next day.\n\nWait, the reminder_timestamp_upperbound is the upper bound of the POSIX timestamp for when the reminder should be reminded. So if the reminder is set for yesterday (all day), then the reminder_timestamp should be between 2025-08-14 00:00:00 and 2025-08-15 00:00:00.\n\nTherefore, the lowerbound is 2025-08-14 00:00:00, upperbound is 2025-08-15 00:00:00.\n\nSo to get the upper bound, it's the start of today (August 15, 00:00:00).\n\nSince the current date is August 15, 06:37:19, the start of today is August 15, 00:00:00.\n\nSo perhaps it's easier to get the start of today and subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since we know today's date from the previous step (2025-08-15), we can compute yesterday's start as today's date minus one day at 00:00:00.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp is 2025-08-15 06:37:19. So the start of today is 2025-08-15 00:00:00.\n\nTo get the start of yesterday, subtract 24 hours from today's start.\n\nBut perhaps using utilities_5 on the current timestamp to shift back by one day, but adjusted to midnight.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, get the start of today (August 15, 00:00:00) by using utilities_1 with year=2025, month=8, day=15, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, the start of yesterday is that timestamp minus 86400 seconds (24 hours).\n\nBut maybe it's better to directly calculate yesterday's start.\n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is 1755254239.669515, which converts to 2025-08-15 06:37:19.\n\nSo, to get yesterday's date, we can subtract 24 hours from the current timestamp, but that would give 2025-08-14 06:37:19, which is not the start of the day.\n\nBut we need the entire day of yesterday, so from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 on August 14.\n\nSo the correct approach is to get the timestamp for August 14, 00:00:00 as lowerbound and August 15, 00:00:00 as upperbound.\n\nTherefore, to get lowerbound: utilities_1 with 2025,8,14,0,0,0.\n\nUpperbound: utilities_1 with 2025,8,15,0,0,0.\n\nSo I need to make two calls to utilities_1.\n\nFirst, for lowerbound: year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, for upperbound: year=2025, month=8, day=15, hour=0, minute=0, second",
