The response came back as 14705.152.\n\nNow I need to present this answer clearly. Let me check if the amount makes sense. Current exchange rates are around 7.2 USD to 1 CNY, so 2048 * 7.2 is roughly 14745.6. The response is 14705.15, which is close, maybe the rate was slightly different. \n\nI should format the answer to two decimal places since it's currency. So 14,705.15 CNY. Also, mention the exchange rate if possible, but the tool response didn't provide it. Maybe just state the converted amount clearly.\n\nMake sure to specify the currencies and the amount. The user might want to know it's approximate or the exact figure. Since the tool gave a precise number, present it as is but rounded to standard currency format.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is equivalent to **14,705.15 CNY** (Chinese Yuan) based on the current exchange rate. \n\n*Note: Currency conversion rates fluctuate frequently, so this value reflects the rate at the time of the query.*"
