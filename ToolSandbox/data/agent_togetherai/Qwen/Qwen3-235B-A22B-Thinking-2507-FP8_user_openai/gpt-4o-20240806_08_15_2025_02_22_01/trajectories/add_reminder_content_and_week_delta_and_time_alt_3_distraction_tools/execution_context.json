                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current time isn't given, I should probably get the current timestamp first. Wait, there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give me the current POSIX time. Let me call that.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I need to shift it to tomorrow at 5 PM. Tomorrow is one day from now, but 5 PM is a specific time. Maybe I should convert the current timestamp to datetime info to see what the current date and time is, then set the time to 17:00 (5 PM) the next day. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day and adjust the time.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if today is, say, Monday, then tomorrow is Tuesday at 5 PM. So I need to calculate that exact time.\n\nAnother approach: Use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, etc. So maybe first get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then add one day, set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (tomorrow), set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n4. Convert that new datetime info back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but what if tomorrow is the next month or year? For example, if today is the 31st of December, adding a day would roll over to January. But the timestamp_to_datetime_info would handle that correctly when we increment the day.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day and then adjust the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting by days would add 24 hours, but if the current time is after 5 PM, adding a day would take it to the next day same time, but the user wants exactly 5 PM tomorrow. So maybe better to calculate the exact time.\n\nLet me think. Suppose current time is 3 PM today. Tomorrow at 5 PM is 26 hours from now. But if current time is 6 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours from now. So shifting by 1 day (24 hours) would get to 6 PM tomorrow, which is not 5 PM. So shifting by days isn't sufficient; need to set the exact time.\n\nTherefore, better approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).\n3. Add 1 day to the date (so tomorrow).\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to add 1 day to the date? Maybe using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the adjusted values.\n\nWait, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp requires specific year, month, day, etc. So steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date/time components.\n- Add 1 to the day. If day exceeds the number of days in the month, it would roll over, but the function should handle that? Wait, no, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives the current components, but if I just add 1 to the day, I might get an invalid date (e.g., 31st of April). So perhaps better to use shift_timestamp to add 24 hours, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, maybe another way: take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day (24 hours), then set the time to 17:00. But how to set the time? Maybe shift_timestamp can't do that directly. Alternatively, take the current timestamp, convert to datetime info, add 1 day, set hour to 17, then convert back.\n\nLet me try this step by step.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX.\n\nSuppose the current timestamp is T.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info(T) to get {year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday}.\n\nThen, tomorrow's date would be adding 1 day. But if day+1 exceeds the days in the month, the actual date would increment the month. However, when we construct the new datetime info, we need to make sure the day is valid. But since we're getting the current date via timestamp_to_datetime_info, adding 1 to the day might not be safe. For example, if today is 31st March, adding 1 day would be 32nd March, which is invalid. But the correct way is to use a function that handles date arithmetic, but since we don't have that, perhaps using shift_timestamp to add 24 hours, then adjust the hour to 17.\n\nWait, but shifting by 24 hours would give the same time tomorrow. Then, if the current time is, say, 3 PM, shifting 24 hours gives 3 PM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So we need to adjust the time.\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, shift it to midnight of tomorrow, then add 17 hours.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Shift T to midnight of the same day: subtract current hour*3600 + minute*60 + second.\n3. Add 1 day (86400 seconds) to get midnight of tomorrow.\n4. Add 17 hours (17*3600) to get 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nBut how to get the current hour, minute, second? By converting T to datetime info.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get T via get_current_timestamp.\n- Convert T to datetime_info to get current hour, min, sec.\n- Calculate seconds since midnight: hour*3600 + min*60 + sec.\n- Subtract that from T to get midnight today.\n- Add 86400 (1 day) to get midnight tomorrow.\n- Add 17*3600 to get 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way using the shift_timestamp function.\n\nWait, shift_timestamp allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So:\n\nIf I take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? For example, if current time is 14:30, shifting by 1 day gives 14:30 tomorrow. To get to 17:00, need to add 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut the user just says \"tomorrow 5PM\", regardless of current time. So the exact timestamp is tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- Determine tomorrow's date at 17:00:00 as a POSIX timestamp.\n\nTo do this:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Add 1 to the day.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut adding 1 to the day may cause overflow (e.g., 31st +1 = 32nd), but when converting back via datetime_info_to_timestamp, it should handle it correctly (i.e., roll over to next month).\n\nWait, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp function expects valid date components. So if I have year=2023, month=12, day=32, it would be invalid, but in reality, when you add 1 day to 2023-12-31, it becomes 2024-01-01. However, the user's function datetime_info_to_timestamp probably expects valid inputs, so if I just increment day by 1 without checking, it might fail.\n\nTherefore, safer to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, here's another approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Use shift_timestamp to add 1 day: T + 86400.\n- Convert that shifted timestamp to datetime_info.\n- Now, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but how? Because shifting by 1 day gives the same time tomorrow. Then, to set to 5 PM, need to adjust the hour.\n\nWait, no. If current time is 10 AM, shifting by 1 day gives 10 AM tomorrow. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, need to add 7 hours to the shifted timestamp.\n\nBut the user wants exactly 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time. So the correct timestamp is tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime_info (current_date).\n3. Create a new datetime_info where:\n   - year = current_date.year\n   - month = current_date.month\n   - day = current_date.day + 1\n   - hour = 17\n   - minute = 0\n   - second = 0\n4. But need to handle day overflow. For example, if current",
