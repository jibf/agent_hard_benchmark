                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what they're asking for. They want to know their to-do items from yesterday. But the tools provided are about reminders, not todos. Wait, maybe in this context, \"todo\" refers to reminders. The search_reminder function can look up reminders based on criteria like timestamps.\n\nSo, to find reminders from yesterday, I need to determine the timestamp range for yesterday. But the user didn't specify a time zone, which could be a problem. However, maybe the system uses the user's local time zone, but since it's not specified, I'll assume UTC for now, though that's a bit risky. But maybe the functions handle time zones implicitly.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp. Wait, but there's no function to get the current time. Hmm. Wait, the user is asking about yesterday, so I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nWait, but to calculate that, I need to know the current date. Since I don't have the current time, maybe I need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, perhaps the system expects me to use the current time as now, but since I can't get it directly, maybe I need to use another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should first convert \"yesterday\" into a date range. Let's think: if today is October 5, 2023, then yesterday is October 4, 2023. The start of yesterday would be 00:00:00 on October 4, and the end would be 23:59:59 on October 4.\n\nBut to get those timestamps, I need to know today's date. Since I don't have the current time, perhaps I need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp. Wait, but how do I get the current timestamp? The tools don't include a function to get the current time. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the user's question implies that \"yesterday\" is relative to the current system time. But without a function to get the current time, I can't compute the exact timestamps. Wait, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can help. If I could get the current timestamp, then subtract a day. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the current time is available. Wait, the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp, so maybe the system expects me to use another method. Alternatively, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used with the current date, but I don't know the current date.\n\nThis is a bit of a catch-22. The user is asking for yesterday's todos, but without knowing the current date, I can't compute yesterday's date. However, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the reference point, even if I can't explicitly get it. Wait, but the tools don't provide a way to get the current time. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant is supposed to ask for clarification. The user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't specified. But the user might be referring to their local time, which the system might know, but since it's not provided in the tools, perhaps I need to proceed by calculating based on a hypothetical current time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the reference. Let's assume that \"now\" is the current timestamp. But since I can't get it, perhaps I need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with a timestamp that's not provided. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first determine the start and end timestamps for yesterday. To do that, I need to:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp (but no function for that).\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to find today's date.\n3. Subtract one day to get yesterday's date.\n4. Create start and end timestamps for yesterday.\n\nBut without a function to get the current timestamp, step 1 is impossible. Therefore, the user's query is ambiguous because it doesn't specify the date, and the system can't determine \"yesterday\" without knowing the current date.\n\nWait, but maybe the system has access to the current time implicitly. For example, when the user asks \"yesterday,\" the system knows the current date. However, in the context of this problem, since the tools don't include a function to get the current time, perhaps I need to use the shift_timestamp function with a reference timestamp. But without a starting point, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the current time as now, and proceed to calculate. Let's try to outline the steps:\n\n- Assume current time is now (timestamp T).\n- Yesterday's start is T minus 1 day, at 00:00:00.\n- Yesterday's end is T minus 1 day, at 23:59:59.\n\nBut to get T, I need the current timestamp. Since there's no function to get it, perhaps this is a flaw in the tool setup, but as an assistant, I need to proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used with the current date, but I don't know the current date. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's question is ambiguous, and I should ask for clarification. The instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user said \"yesterday,\" but without knowing the current date, it's ambiguous. However, in most contexts, \"yesterday\" refers to the day before the current day, so the system should know the current date. But since the tools don't provide a way to get the current timestamp, maybe the assistant is expected to proceed by calculating based on the current time.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think differently. Maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current time, but since it's not provided, perhaps it's assumed that the current timestamp is available. Wait, no, the tools don't have a function to get the current time.\n\nThis is a problem. The user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" is time-dependent, and without the current date, we can't determine it. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for their todo from yesterday. Maybe the system stores reminders with creation timestamps or reminder timestamps. The search_reminder function can search based on reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nSo, to find reminders for yesterday, we need the reminder timestamp to be within yesterday's date.\n\nBut to get that range, we need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nAssuming that the current time is known (even though the tools don't have a function to get it), perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed by using the current time as a reference.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But how to get the current date?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system expects the assistant to use the current time as the reference point and calculate accordingly. Let's try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the current date (year, month, day).\n2. Subtract one day to get yesterday's date.\n3. Calculate the start timestamp (00:00:00 of yesterday) and end timestamp (23:59:59 of yesterday).\n4. Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to these values.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, step 1 is impossible. Therefore, the query is ambiguous, and the assistant should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. The user said \"yesterday,\" which is relative, so without knowing the current date, it's ambiguous. However, in practice, \"yesterday\" is always relative to the current day, so the system should know the current date. But since the tools don't provide a way to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant is expected to proceed under the assumption that the current time is available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with a timestamp that represents now, but since it's not provided, this is not possible.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Given the tools provided, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday based on the current time, but since we can't get the current time, we need to use another method.\n\nWait, maybe the shift_timestamp function can be used if we have a reference timestamp. But without a starting timestamp, we can't shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But how to get the current date?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Given the problem constraints, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that \"yesterday\" requires calculating the date range, which involves converting \"yesterday\" into timestamps. To do that, we need to know today's date, which we can get by converting the current timestamp to datetime info. But since we don't have the current timestamp, maybe the system expects us to assume that the current timestamp is available, and proceed to calculate.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the current time as the reference, even if it's not explicitly provided. For example, in real systems, the server has a current time. So, assuming that the current timestamp is T, then:\n\n- Yesterday's start: T - 1 day, at 00:00:00\n-",
