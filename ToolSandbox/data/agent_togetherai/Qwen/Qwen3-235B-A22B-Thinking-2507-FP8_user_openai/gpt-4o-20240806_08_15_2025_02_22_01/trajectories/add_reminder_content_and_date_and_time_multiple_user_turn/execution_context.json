There's add_reminder and datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nFirst, the add_reminder function needs content and a timestamp. The user didn't specify when, so I need to ask for the time. Wait, the instructions say not to assume values. So I can't just pick a time. I should ask the user when they want to be reminded.\n\nBut maybe the user expects me to use the current time? No, the problem says not to make assumptions. So I need to clarify the timestamp. Let me check the parameters again. The required fields for add_reminder are content and reminder_timestamp. The timestamp has to be a POSIX timestamp, which is a number.\n\nSince the user didn't provide a date or time, I can't generate the timestamp. So I should prompt them to specify when they want the reminder. Maybe they meant right now, but the instructions say not to assume. So I need to ask for the exact time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, but that requires year, month, day, etc. Without those, I can't convert. So the correct step is to ask the user for the specific date and time they want the reminder set for.\n</think>\n\nTo set your reminder, I need to know when you'd like to be reminded. Could you please specify the date and time (e.g., \"tomorrow at 3pm\", \"next Monday at 9am\")?",

I used the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the provided date parts. The response was 1711141200.0, which I then passed to add_reminder along with the content. The add_reminder function returned a UUID, 'ce4ce4ea-ee02-47e5-9a98-627c50e269e7', which is probably the reminder ID.\n\nNow, I need to confirm to the user that the reminder was set. I should mention the date and time in a friendly way. Since the timestamp was converted correctly, March 22, 2024, at 5 PM is the correct time. I should present it clearly. Also, maybe add a note about the reminder being set successfully and perhaps mention the ID if the user needs to reference it later. But the user didn't ask for the ID, so maybe just a confirmation message without the UUID unless it's standard practice here. The example response from the tool just gives the UUID, but the user might not need it. So the final answer should be a confirmation that the reminder is set for that date and time.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to buy chocolate milk has been set for **March 22, 2024 at 5:00 PM**. I'll make sure you're notified on time! 🥛",
