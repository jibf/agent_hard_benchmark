    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the components required for the add_reminder function. The required parameters are content and reminder_timestamp. Optional ones are latitude and longitude.\n\nThe content is straightforward: \"buy chocolate milk\". But the location is Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So I need to get the latitude and longitude for that location. Wait, the user didn't provide coordinates, so I should use the search_location_around_lat_lon function to find the coordinates of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"tomorrow 5PM\". I need to convert that into a POSIX timestamp. So first, get the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. Wait, maybe I should use get_current_timestamp to find the current time, then calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. Alternatively, use datetime_info_to_timestamp by figuring out the exact date.\n\nWait, the user says \"tomorrow\". Let's assume today's date. Let's say today is October 25, 2023. Then tomorrow is October 26. But since I don't have the current date, maybe I need to get the current timestamp first. Hmm, but the functions available include get_current_timestamp. So maybe I should first call get_current_timestamp to know the current time, then compute tomorrow 5 PM from there.\n\nWait, but the user might not have specified the current time zone. However, the functions probably handle that. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the reminder timestamp: tomorrow at 5 PM. To convert that to a POSIX timestamp, I need the exact year, month, day, hour, etc. So perhaps I need to:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp to determine what \"tomorrow\" is.\n2. Convert that current timestamp to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day).\n4. Set the time to 17:00 (5 PM in 24h format).\n5. Convert that datetime info to a timestamp.\n\nBut looking at the available functions, there's datetime_info_to_timestamp which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So to use that, I need to know those values for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use get_current_timestamp first, then add 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's same time, but adjust the hour to 17:00. Wait, but if it's 6 PM today, adding 24 hours would be 6 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So better to calculate the exact date.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Get current timestamp (using get_current_timestamp)\n- Convert that timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info)\n- Extract year, month, day, then add 1 day to get tomorrow's date\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0\n- Convert that datetime info to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp\n\nBut since the user didn't specify the current time zone, maybe the system assumes the user's local time zone. However, the functions probably handle that internally.\n\nSo first, I need to get the current timestamp to know what \"tomorrow\" is. Let's call get_current_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user's message is \"tomorrow 5PM\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5 PM. So perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (handling month/year rollover if needed).\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do date math directly, it needs to use the provided functions. Wait, the available functions include datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info. So maybe:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that timestamp to datetime info to get current date and time.\n\nThen, calculate tomorrow's date by adding 1 to the day, adjusting month/year as necessary.\n\nBut the assistant can't perform the date math itself; it has to use the functions. Wait, no—the assistant has to generate the correct parameters for the functions. Wait, the assistant is supposed to call the functions step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n- Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current date components.\n- Then, compute tomorrow's date (day +1, handling month/year changes).\n- Then, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Then, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nBut since the assistant can't compute the date math, it has to infer based on the current date. However, the assistant can't actually do the math; it has to generate the correct function calls. Wait, no—the assistant is supposed to decide which functions to call, but the actual computation is done by the tools. Wait, no: the assistant generates the tool calls with the necessary parameters.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.\n\nThe user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". To get the timestamp for that, the assistant needs to know what tomorrow is. Since the current date isn't provided, the assistant must first get the current timestamp.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nOnce we have the current timestamp, we can convert it to datetime info to find today's date, then calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\nBut the assistant can't do the calculation itself; it has to use the tools. Wait, no—the assistant has to generate the parameters for the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. So after getting the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then adjust the date.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Then, compute tomorrow's date (day +1), making sure to handle month/year rollover (e.g., if today is the last day of the month).\n4. Then, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the computed date and time.\n\nBut the assistant can't compute step 3; it has to generate the correct parameters. However, since the assistant doesn't have the current date, it needs to get it via the tools.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use that timestamp in timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nThen, based on the result, determine tomorrow's date.\n\nBut since the assistant is generating the tool calls, it needs to do this step by step.\n\nWait, but the user's message is a single request. The assistant needs to make multiple tool calls to resolve it.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, based on the response, call timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date (but how? The assistant would have to infer, but since it's a language model, it can simulate the date math).\n\nWait, but in reality, the assistant would generate the first tool call, then the system would provide a response, then the assistant would generate the next tool call based on that response. However, in this scenario, the assistant has to plan all the tool calls needed in one go, but according to the problem statement, for each function call, return a json object within tool_call tags. But the user's question requires multiple steps.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo the assistant should output the first necessary tool call, then presumably the system would respond, and then the assistant would proceed. But in this context, since it's a single turn, the assistant needs to figure out all the necessary tool calls in sequence.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should make one or more function calls. However, given that some functions depend on the output of others, the assistant needs to make them in order.\n\nBut the user's message is a single query, so the assistant must determine the sequence.\n\nLet's outline the steps needed:\n\n1. Determine the location (Whole Foods on Stevens Creek) to get latitude and longitude.\n   - Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But latitude and longitude are optional; since they're not provided, it defaults to current location. Wait, but the user didn't specify current location, so maybe the search should be around the user's current location. However, the problem is that without knowing the current lat/lon, the search might not be accurate. But the function defaults to current if not provided. So perhaps call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods\", and maybe \"Stevens Creek\" as part of the location string.\n\nWait, the location parameter is a surface form query, so \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" is appropriate.\n\nSo first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the coordinates.\n\n2. Determine the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\n   a. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n   b. Convert to datetime info to get current date.\n   c. Calculate tomorrow's date (day +1).\n   d. Set time to 17:00:00.\n   e. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut steps 2a to 2e require multiple tool calls.\n\nHowever, the assistant needs to decide the order.\n\nBut the problem is that the assistant can't know the current timestamp without calling get_current_timestamp first.\n\n"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wanted to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I used the search_location_around_lat_lon function to find the coordinates of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. The response gave me the latitude and longitude: 37.3235879 and -122.0396177.\n\nNext, I needed to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. So I called get_current_timestamp, which returned 1755253930.418035. Converting that to datetime info showed it's August 15, 2025, at 6:32 AM. \n\nSince the user said \"tomorrow,\" I added one day to get August 16, 2025. Then set the time to 5 PM (17:00). Using datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values gave me 1755378000.0.\n\nFinally, I called add_reminder with the content, the coordinates from the search, and the calculated timestamp. The response was a reminder ID, so it worked. Now I should confirm the reminder was added successfully.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to buy chocolate milk has been successfully added! 🥛  \n**When:** Tomorrow (August 16, 2025) at 5:00 PM  \n**Where:** Whole Foods Market (20955 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA)  \n**Reminder ID:** 7988751c-aa3a-4e6a-9975-735931483917  \n\nLet me know if you'd like to modify or check this reminder! 😊"
