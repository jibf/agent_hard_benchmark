Then I used reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to that current timestamp to find reminders scheduled for later. But the response was an empty list.\n\nHmm, maybe there are no reminders set after the current time. But maybe the user meant something else by \"later,\" like within a certain timeframe. Wait, the user didn't specify a date or time range, so the initial approach makes sense. But the result is empty. Should I check if there are reminders with a reminder timestamp equal to the current time? Or maybe the user has reminders but they're all in the past?\n\nWait, the function reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to current time would get reminders from now onwards. If the result is empty, then there are no upcoming reminders. But maybe I should check if there's a mistake in the parameters. Let me think: the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound is the lower bound for the reminder time, so reminders with timestamp >= lowerbound. Since we set it to current time, it should include all future reminders.\n\nBut the response was empty. So the answer is there are no todos scheduled for later. But maybe the user expects some default timeframe, like today or this week. Wait, the user didn't specify, so according to the problem statement, I shouldn't make assumptions. The correct response is to inform them that there are no reminders scheduled after the current time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's \"later\" refers to a specific time they have in mind, but since they didn't specify, the assistant can only check from now onwards. Since the result is empty, the answer is there's nothing on their todo later.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders scheduled after the current time. Your todo list for later appears to be empty. Would you like to set a new reminder?",

Since they're saying it's okay and thanking, they probably don't need anything else. \n\nI should check if there's anything else they might need, but they seem satisfied. Maybe a polite reply to their thanks. The previous interaction was about checking reminders, and they decided not to set a new one. So the appropriate response is to say you're welcome and offer further help if needed.\n\nI need to make sure not to call any more functions because the user isn't asking for anything else. Just a friendly sign-off. So the response should be something like, \"You're welcome! Let me know if you need any further assistance. Have a great day!\" That's it.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome!
