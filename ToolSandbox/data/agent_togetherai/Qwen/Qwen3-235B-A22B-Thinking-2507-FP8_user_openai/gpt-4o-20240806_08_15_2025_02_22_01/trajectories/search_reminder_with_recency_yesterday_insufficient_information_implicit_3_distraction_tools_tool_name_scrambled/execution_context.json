Since the current date isn't provided, I might need to calculate yesterday's date based on the current time. But the tools available don't include a function to get the current timestamp. Wait, maybe I can use utilities_1 to convert a specific date to a POSIX timestamp, but I need to know the current date for that.\n\nWait, the user is asking about their todo from yesterday. So the reminders are probably stored with a reminder timestamp. To find todos from yesterday, I need to get the timestamp range for yesterday.\n\nLet me think. To find reminders that were supposed to be reminded yesterday, I need the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nBut to calculate that, I need to know today's date. Since I don't have the current time, maybe the system assumes that the current time is available, but the tools don't have a function to get the current timestamp. Hmm.\n\nWait, there's utilities_5 which can shift a timestamp by deltas, but I need a starting timestamp. Maybe I need to first get the current timestamp using another method, but the tools don't have a function for that. Wait, perhaps the system expects me to use the current time as known, but since it's not provided, maybe I need to ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't specified. The assistant shouldn't assume the current date. The instructions say not to make assumptions about values to plug into functions and to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous.\n\nSo in this case, the user didn't specify a date, so \"yesterday\" is relative to when? The system might not know the current date, so the assistant should ask for clarification. For example, \"Could you specify the date you're referring to as 'yesterday'?\" or \"Please provide the current date so I can determine yesterday's date.\"\n\nBut according to the problem statement, if the request is ambiguous, I should ask for clarification instead of making assumptions. Since the user didn't provide a specific date, and the system doesn't have access to the current date (as there's no function to get it), I can't compute yesterday's timestamp. Therefore, I need to ask the user to clarify which date they consider as yesterday, or provide the current date.\n</think>\n\nThe request \"What's my todo yesterday?\" is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't specified. Since I don't have access to real-time data or your current date context, I need clarification:\n\n**Please specify the reference date for \"yesterday\"** (e.g., \"What were my todos for June 4th, 2024?\") or confirm if you'd like me to assume today's date based on your timezone.",

Wait, the tools available include utilities to convert dates to POSIX timestamps, but without knowing the current date, how can I calculate yesterday?\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to assume that \"yesterday\" is relative to today's date. But since I don't have access to the current date, I need to ask for clarification. However, the user already asked a similar question before, and the assistant asked for the reference date. Now the user is rephrasing the question, maybe expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, looking at the tools, there's utilities_1 which converts date-time to POSIX timestamp, and utilities_5 which shifts a timestamp. But without knowing the current timestamp, I can't compute yesterday's date. Unless there's a way to get the current time through another tool, but the tools provided don't include a function to get the current time. \n\nSo, the problem is that \"yesterday\" is relative and requires knowing today's date. Since the system doesn't have that info, the correct step is to ask the user to specify the date they're referring to. The previous response from the assistant did ask for clarification, and now the user is repeating the question, perhaps expecting me to proceed with an assumption. But the instructions say not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, I should again request the user to specify the date for \"yesterday\" or confirm if they want to proceed with a particular reference date. However, the user might be expecting that the system can infer the current date. But since the tools don't provide a way to get the current time, it's impossible. So the correct action is to ask for clarification again.\n</think>\n\nThe request \"What's in my reminder from yesterday?\" remains ambiguous because \"yesterday\" requires a reference date to calculate the correct timestamp range. Since I cannot determine your current date/time context:\n\n**Please specify the exact date you're referring to** (e.g., \"What reminders did I have on June 4th, 2024?\") or confirm if you'd like me to proceed with a specific reference date/time. \n\nWithout this clarification, I cannot accurately query your reminders.",

The previous responses pointed out that \"yesterday\" is ambiguous without knowing the current date. But maybe the user expects the system to use the current date as the reference.\n\nWait, the tools provided include utilities_1 which converts date-time to POSIX timestamp, and utilities_7 which converts a timestamp back to date-time info. But the assistant doesn't have access to real-time data. However, maybe the user assumes that the system knows today's date. But according to the problem statement, the assistant can't make assumptions. The user hasn't provided a specific date, so the assistant needs to ask for clarification.\n\nBut the user keeps asking the same question. Maybe they're expecting the assistant to use the current date as \"today\" to calculate yesterday. However, the instructions say not to make assumptions. So the correct action is still to ask for the specific date. But the user might be frustrated after three times. Wait, looking at the history: the first message was \"What's my todo yesterday?\" and the assistant asked for clarification. Then the user rephrased to \"What's in my reminder from yesterday?\" and again the assistant asked for clarification. Now the third time, \"Can you find my reminder from yesterday?\".\n\nThe problem is that without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute yesterday's date. Since the assistant can't access real-time data, it's impossible to determine what \"yesterday\" refers to. Therefore, the correct response is still to request the user to specify the date. However, maybe the user expects the system to use the current date (as in, when the query is made), but since the assistant can't know that, it's stuck.\n\nWait, but maybe the tools can help. For example, if the assistant could get the current timestamp via some function, but looking at the tools provided: there's no function to get the current time. The utilities functions are for converting or shifting timestamps, but not for getting the current time. So the assistant can't determine \"yesterday\" without the user providing a reference.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to again ask for the specific date. But the user has been asked twice already. However, the instructions say not to make assumptions, so even if the user is persistent, the assistant must not assume. So the answer should again request clarification.\n\nBut the user might be expecting that \"yesterday\" is relative to when they're asking, which in a real scenario would be the current date. However, since the assistant can't access that, it's impossible. Therefore, the only correct action is to ask for the date.
