                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact date and time for \"next Friday 5PM\". But wait, what's today's date? Since the user didn't specify, I should probably get the current timestamp to calculate next Friday.\n\nSo, I'll start by calling get_current_timestamp to know the current time. Once I have that, I can determine what day of the week it is. Let's say today is Tuesday. Then next Friday would be in 3 days. But if today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. Wait, but the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday, not the same day if it's already Friday. Hmm, but maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, maybe there's a function that can help convert datetime info to a timestamp. But first, I need to know the current date. Let me use get_current_timestamp. Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info to find the current day.\n\nWait, the tools provided include timestamp_to_datetime_info. So, first step: get current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to know the current day, then calculate next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me check the functions again. There's shift_timestamp which can add days, but I need to know how many days to add to get to next Friday.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, etc.) to find the current day of the week.\n3. Calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Monday, next Friday is 4 days later. If today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later.\n4. Use shift_timestamp to add the required days to the current timestamp to get the reminder time.\n5. Then call add_reminder with the content and the calculated timestamp.\n\nBut the user said \"next Friday 5PM\". So, regardless of the current time, the reminder should be set for 5 PM on the next Friday.\n\nWait, but 5 PM is 17:00 in 24-hour format. So after calculating the date for next Friday, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nHmm, but how to handle that. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, get current timestamp. Let's say current timestamp is T.\n\nConvert T to datetime info to get current day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday maybe? Or 1=Monday? Wait, depends on the system. But the exact mapping might not matter as long as I can calculate the days to next Friday.)\n\nAssuming that datetime_info has a 'weekday' field. Wait, but looking at the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp, it includes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info function returns those fields, including the day of the week as a number.\n\nWait, the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp are year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So when converting a timestamp to datetime info, it should return those values. But how to get the day of the week? Maybe the 'day' here is the day of the month, not the day of the week. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the function timestamp_to_datetime_info probably returns the date components (year, month, day, hour, etc.), but not the day of the week. So to find out what day of the week it is, I need to calculate it from the date.\n\nBut without knowing the current day of the week, how can I compute how many days until next Friday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach. Let's think: the user says \"next Friday\". So if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days from now. If today is Saturday, next Friday is 6 days from now, etc.\n\nSo, first, get current timestamp. Then, convert to datetime info to get the current day of the week. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the timestamp_to_datetime_info function returns the day of the week as part of the info. Let me check the function description. The function timestamp_to_datetime_info has parameters that include timestamp, and the required parameter is timestamp. The description says it returns datetime info, which would include year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But does it include the day of the week? The parameters listed for the function are just the timestamp, and the output isn't specified. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAssuming that when you convert a timestamp to datetime info, you get the day of the week as a number (e.g., 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday), but the function's parameters don't specify that. Wait, the function's parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp require year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So maybe the output of timestamp_to_datetime_info includes those fields, but not the day of the week. So to find the day of the week, I need to compute it from the date.\n\nBut since I don't have a function that directly gives the day of the week, maybe I need to calculate it. However, without knowing the current day of the week, how can I compute the days until next Friday?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's say I get the current timestamp, then shift it by 0 days to get today's date, then calculate how many days to add to reach Friday.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time T.\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n3. Determine what day of the week today is. For example, if today is Tuesday (2), then Friday is 5, so days to add = (5 - 2) = 3. If today is Friday (5), days to add = 7. If today is Saturday (6), days to add = 6 (since next Friday is 6 days later: Saturday -> Sunday (1), Monday (2), ..., Friday (6 days later? Wait, Saturday to next Friday is 6 days: Sat(0), Sun(1), Mon(2), Tue(3), Wed(4), Thu(5), Fri(6). Wait, no. From Saturday to next Friday is 6 days? Let's count: Saturday is day 0, Sunday 1, Monday 2, Tuesday 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6. So yes, 6 days. Wait, but if today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nWait, the formula for days until next Friday: (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. But if current_day is Friday (5), then (5-5 +7) %7 =7%7=0, which would be same day. But user said \"next Friday\", which would be 7 days later. So maybe the formula is (5 - current_day + 7) %7, but if it's 0, add 7.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7\nif days_to_add ==0, then days_to_add=7.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nIf current_day is Friday (5): (5-5 +7)%7=7%7=0 → days_to_add=7.\n\nIf current_day is Saturday (6): (5-6 +7)=6 → 6%7=6 → days_to_add=6.\n\nIf current_day is Sunday (0): (5-0 +7)=12 → 12%7=5 → days_to_add=5.\n\nYes, that works. So days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7\nif days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nBut how do I get current_day (the day of the week as a number where 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday)?\n\nAssuming that the timestamp_to_datetime_info function returns the day of the week as a number. Wait, but the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp are year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So perhaps the output of timestamp_to_datetime_info includes the day of the week. Let's assume that when you convert a timestamp to datetime info, it includes a 'weekday' field, which is an integer from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).\n\nBut the function's description doesn't specify that. Hmm, this is a problem. The user instructions say not to make assumptions, so maybe I need to clarify. But since I can't ask the user, perhaps I have to proceed with the tools given.\n\nWait, the tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which takes year, month, day, etc., and returns a timestamp. But to get the day of the week, perhaps I need to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift_timestamp function can help. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's get the current timestamp, then calculate the timestamp for next Friday 5 PM directly.\n\nBut how? Let's say today is October 10, 2023, which is a Tuesday. Next Friday is October 13. But if today is October 12 (Thursday), next Friday is October 13. Wait, no: if today is Thursday, next Friday is tomorrow.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current date and time.\n3. Set the time to 17",
