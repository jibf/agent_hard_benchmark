                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the user didn't specify a timezone, I'll assume it's the current timezone. But to get the exact POSIX timestamp, I need the current date and time. Wait, maybe I should use the get_current_timestamp function first to know the current time, then calculate tomorrow's 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user says \"tomorrow\", so if today is, say, October 5th, tomorrow is October 6th. But I need to convert 5 PM of tomorrow into a timestamp. However, without knowing the current date, I can't compute tomorrow's date. So maybe I need to get the current timestamp first.\n\nSo step 1: Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time in POSIX. Then, using that, figure out tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the tools available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, etc. So maybe after getting the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, add a day, set the time to 5 PM, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if today is October 5th, 2023, and current time is 3 PM, then tomorrow at 5 PM is October 6th, 5 PM. But if current time is 6 PM, then tomorrow would still be October 6th, but maybe the user means the next day at 5 PM regardless.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add one day to the current date to get tomorrow's date.\n4. Set the time to 5 PM (17:00 in 24h format).\n5. Convert that datetime info back to a POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but there's a function called datetime_info_to_timestamp which takes year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So after getting current datetime, add 1 day, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut how to handle adding a day? For example, if current date is 2023-10-31, adding a day would be 2023-11-01. But since the tool doesn't handle date arithmetic, I need to do that manually. Wait, but as an assistant, I can compute it. Wait, but the assistant can't perform calculations; it has to use the tools provided. Hmm, no, the assistant can process the data. Wait, the assistant is supposed to generate the correct parameters for the functions.\n\nWait, the assistant needs to figure out the correct timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. To do that, it needs to know the current date and time. So first, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get the current year, month, day, etc. Then, add one day to the day, handling month and year rollovers if necessary. Then set the hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0. Then convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the result to get current datetime components.\n3. Increment the day by 1, adjusting month and year if needed.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date and time.\n6. Then, find the location of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek using search_location_around_lat_lon, but since latitude and longitude aren't provided, maybe the user expects to search for \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" as the location parameter. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires a location string, and optionally latitude and longitude. Since the user mentioned \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", the location parameter should be \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" or just \"Whole Foods\". But the user specified the address as \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", so the location string is \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon has parameters: location (required), latitude, longitude (optional, default to current if not provided). But since we need the latitude and longitude of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to set in the reminder, we need to first search for that location.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- First, get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow's 5 PM.\n- Then, search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get its latitude and longitude.\n- Then, create the reminder with the calculated timestamp and the location's lat/lon.\n\nWait, but the user says \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", so the reminder should be triggered when the user is at that location. So the reminder needs the latitude and longitude of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nSo the process:\n\n1. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the lat/lon of that store.\n2. Get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow 5 PM.\n3. Convert current timestamp to datetime, add 1 day, set time to 17:00:00, convert to timestamp.\n4. Use that timestamp and the lat/lon from step 1 to add the reminder.\n\nWait, but the user might not have specified the exact address, so \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" could refer to a specific store. The search_location_around_lat_lon function will return the location's lat/lon.\n\nSo first, need to call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nThen, get the current timestamp to compute the reminder time.\n\nWait, but the order might not matter. Let's outline the required function calls:\n\na. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get latitude and longitude.\n\nb. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nc. Convert current timestamp to datetime info, add 1 day, set time to 17:00:00, convert to new timestamp.\n\nBut wait, the assistant can't perform date calculations, so it needs to use the tools. Wait, the tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nSo step-by-step:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current POSIX time (e.g., 1717020000).\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\n3. Add 1 to the day, handling month/year overflow (but as the assistant, I need to compute this). For example, if current day is 31, adding 1 would go to next month.\n\nBut since the assistant can process this, it can generate the correct parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the assistant has to generate the correct arguments for the functions. So after getting the current datetime components, increment day by 1, then if day exceeds the number of days in the month, adjust month and year accordingly. But since the assistant can't compute that, perhaps it's better to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can assume that \"tomorrow\" is current day +1, and set the time to 17:00:00. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then tomorrow is 2023-10-06 17:00:00.\n\nBut the assistant needs to generate the correct parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo, after getting current datetime info (from timestamp_to_datetime_info), add 1 to the day. If the day is invalid (like 32 in a 31-day month), adjust month and year. But since the assistant can't do that, perhaps it's better to use the current timestamp and add 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's same time, then set the hour to 17.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is a specific time, not 24 hours from now. So if it's 3 PM now, tomorrow 5 PM is 26 hours from now. But the correct way is to take today's date, add 1 day, set time to 5 PM.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the correct approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Convert to datetime info.\n\n- Add 1 day to the date.\n\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle adding a day? For example, if current date is 2023-10-31, adding a day would be 2023-11-01.\n\nThe assistant, as an AI, can compute this. So in the tool calls, after getting the current datetime components, the assistant would generate the new date components.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the result from step 1.\n\n3. Use the datetime info to compute tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the computed date and time.\n\n5. Call search_location_around_lat_lon to get the lat/lon of Whole Foods on",
