Since the current timestamp is 1755252749.217384, which I should convert to a date to know the current day. Wait, maybe I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current date details.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\". If today is, say, Wednesday, next Friday is two days later. But if today is Friday, then next Friday would be seven days later. So I need to know the current day of the week.\n\nSo first step: convert the current timestamp to datetime info to get the current day. Let me call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp provided (1755252749.217384).\n\nWait, but the user already provided the current timestamp via the get_current_timestamp response. So I should use that timestamp to find out what day it is.\n\nSo, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with timestamp 1755252749.217384. The response will include isoweekday, which is 1-7 (Monday to Sunday).\n\nOnce I have the current day, calculate how many days until next Friday. Let's say isoweekday is 3 (Wednesday), then next Friday is 2 days later. If it's Friday (5), then next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nThen, set the reminder timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. But need to convert that date and time into a POSIX timestamp.\n\nWait, maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, etc. So first, get current date info, compute the target date, then convert to timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, shift the current timestamp by the required days and time. But need to calculate the correct shift.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current datetime info from the timestamp 1755252749.217384 using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\n2. Determine the number of days to add to reach next Friday.\n\n3. Calculate the target date (year, month, day) for next Friday.\n\n4. Set the time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\n6. Then call add_reminder with that timestamp and the content.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a holiday on that Friday? The user didn't mention, but maybe not necessary. The problem is just about next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add the necessary days and hours. But need to calculate how many days to shift.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose current day is Wednesday (3), next Friday is 2 days later. If current day is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nSo the formula is: days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) % 7. But if current_weekday is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7) %7 =7%7=0, but we want 7 days. So maybe (5 - current_weekday) %7, but if it's 0, add 7.\n\nWait, isoweekday: Monday is 1, Sunday is 7.\n\nSo Friday is 5.\n\nIf current isoweekday is x, then days to next Friday is (5 - x + 7) %7. But if x is 5, then (5-5 +7)=7, 7%7=0, which would be same day. But the user said \"next Friday\", which if today is Friday, it's the following Friday, so 7 days later. So the formula should be (5 - x + 7) %7, but if the result is 0, add 7.\n\nWait, example:\n\nx=3 (Wednesday): (5-3)=2 → 2 days.\n\nx=5 (Friday): (5-5)=0 → 0, but need 7 days. So days_to_add = (5 - x + 7) %7. If the result is 0, then 7.\n\nWait, (5 - x) mod 7. If x=5, (0) mod7=0 → add 7.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - x + 7) %7. If result is 0, then 7.\n\nWait, (5 - x) mod7 gives the days until next Friday. If x=5, 0 days, but user wants next Friday, so 7 days.\n\nThus, days_to_add = (5 - x) %7. If 0, then 7.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - x + 7) %7. Wait, maybe better to compute as:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - x + 7) %7\n\nBut if x=5: (5-5 +7)=7 → 7%7=0 → but we need 7, so perhaps days_to_add = (5 - x + 7) %7 or 7 if 0.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nx=3 (Wednesday): (5-3)=2 → 2 days.\n\nx=5 (Friday): (5-5)=0 → 0, but need 7. So days_to_add = 7 if (5 -x) ==0 else (5 -x).\n\nWait, but if x=6 (Saturday), (5-6)= -1, which mod7 is 6. So days_to_add=6. Which is correct: Saturday to next Friday is 6 days.\n\nWait, maybe better to calculate as (5 - x +7) %7.\n\nFor x=5: (5-5 +7)=7 →7%7=0 → but we need 7 days. So perhaps days_to_add = (5 -x +7) %7. If the result is 0, then 7.\n\nWait, (5 -x +7) %7 gives the number of days to add to get to the next Friday. For x=5, it's 7 days.\n\nWait, (5 -5 +7)=7 →7%7=0. Hmm, maybe the formula is (5 -x) mod7, but if negative, add 7.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\ntarget_weekday =5 (Friday)\n\ncurrent_weekday = x\n\ndays_to_add = (target_weekday - current_weekday) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0:\n\ndays_to_add =7\n\nSo for x=5: (5-5)%7=0 → days_to_add=7\n\nx=3: 2 → 2\n\nx=6: (5-6)= -1 → -1%7=6 → 6 days.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo once I have current_weekday from timestamp_to_datetime_info, compute days_to_add as (5 - current_weekday) %7. If 0, set to 7.\n\nThen, the target date is current date + days_to_add days, at 17:00.\n\nBut need to handle month/year rollover, etc. So perhaps better to use shift_timestamp.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is 1755252749.217384. Let's convert that to datetime to see what date it is.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to know the exact date, just compute the shift.\n\nWait, steps:\n\n1. Get current datetime info (year, month, day, hour, etc.) from current timestamp.\n\n2. Calculate days_to_add as per above.\n\n3. Then, the target date is current date + days_to_add days, time set to 17:00.\n\nBut to get the exact timestamp, perhaps:\n\n- Take current timestamp, shift by days_to_add days, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would set the date, but the time would remain the same as current. So need to adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nAlternatively, compute the target date's timestamp by:\n\ncurrent_date + days_to_add days, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe:\n\n- Get current datetime info.\n\n- Add days_to_add to the day.\n\n- If the day exceeds the month's days, adjust month and year accordingly.\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n1. Current timestamp: 1755252749.217384.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current hour, minute, second.\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add as per weekday.\n\n4. Shift the timestamp by days_to_add days, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to set the time? Maybe:\n\n- Shift by days_to_add days, which gives the same time of day on the target day.\n\n- Then, subtract the current hour, minute, second, and add 17 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.\n\nBut this might be error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting days_to_add days, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the new date, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems feasible.\n\nSo steps:\n\n",
