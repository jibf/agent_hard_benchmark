                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are available. There's add_reminder, which requires content and reminder_timestamp. But the user didn't specify a time, so I need to get the current timestamp to set a default or ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the user didn't mention a specific time. The reminder needs a timestamp. Maybe I should check if there's a function to get the current timestamp. Oh, there's get_current_timestamp. So I can call that first to get the current time, then use that to set the reminder timestamp. But the user might want it for a specific time, but since they didn't specify, maybe set it to the current time or ask for the time.\n\nWait, the add_reminder function requires reminder_timestamp. So without a timestamp, I can't proceed. The user didn't provide a time, so I need to either assume a default (like now) or ask for clarification. But the instructions say not to make assumptions. So maybe I should ask the user when they want the reminder.\n\nWait, but the user said \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" They didn't specify a time. So the assistant should probably ask for the time. However, looking at the tools, there's also search_location_around_lat_lon which can find the location of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. Because the reminder might need latitude and longitude for location-based reminders.\n\nSo steps: 1. Find the location (lat/lon) of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. 2. Get the current timestamp to set a default time, but since user didn't specify, maybe the reminder is location-based, so when they arrive there. But the add_reminder function requires a timestamp. Hmm.\n\nWait, the add_reminder function has parameters: content, reminder_timestamp, and optional lat/lon. So the timestamp is required. Since the user didn't specify a time, perhaps the reminder is supposed to trigger when they are near the location. But the function requires a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is the time they want to be reminded, regardless of location. Or maybe the location is for geofencing, but the timestamp is still needed.\n\nWait, the problem is the user didn't specify when. So the assistant needs to ask for the time. But according to the problem statement, if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. However, the user might expect the reminder to be set for when they are at that location, which would require the location's coordinates. So first, find the location of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to get lat/lon, then maybe set the reminder with that location, but still need a timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reminder is time-based, but the user mentioned the location, so perhaps it's a location-based reminder. But the function requires a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is the time they expect to be there, but since it's not given, the assistant should ask.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because they didn't specify a time. So the correct action is to ask for clarification on when they want the reminder. However, maybe the system can infer that it's a location-based reminder, so the timestamp might not be the primary trigger, but the function still requires it. Wait, looking at the add_reminder parameters: reminder_timestamp is required. So even for location-based reminders, a timestamp is needed. That's confusing. Maybe the timestamp is a fallback if location isn't available.\n\nBut given that, the user didn't provide a time, so the assistant must ask for the time. Alternatively, maybe the system uses the current time as the timestamp, but the instructions say not to make assumptions. So the correct step is to ask the user when they want to be reminded.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", which is a location, so perhaps the reminder is supposed to trigger when they arrive there, which would require the location coordinates. So first, search for the location to get lat/lon, then set the reminder with that location, but still need a timestamp. However, the timestamp is required. Maybe the timestamp is the time they plan to go, but since it's not given, perhaps the assistant should ask for the time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the timestamp can be set to a default, but the instructions say not to assume. So the right move is to ask for the time. But the user might not know they need to specify a time. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the add_reminder function: required parameters are content and reminder_timestamp. So without a timestamp, can't call the function. Therefore, the assistant must get the timestamp. Since the user didn't provide it, the assistant needs to ask for when the reminder should be set.\n\nBut the user's message is \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" So they probably want the reminder when they are at that location, but the function requires a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is the time they expect to be there, but it's not specified. So the assistant should ask for the time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can use the current timestamp as a placeholder, but the instructions say not to assume. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user to specify the time for the reminder.\n\nWait, but maybe the location search is needed first. Let's see: the reminder should be tied to the location (Whole Foods on Stevens Creek), so need to get the lat/lon of that place. So first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But wait, the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon require \"location\" as a string, and optionally lat/lon. Since the user didn't provide lat/lon, but the function can search around current location if lat/lon not provided. However, the assistant doesn't have the current location. Wait, the function's description says: \"When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" But the assistant doesn't have access to the user's current location. So perhaps the function will handle it, but as a tool call, we just need to provide the location string.\n\nSo first step: call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the address and coordinates.\n\nThen, once we have the coordinates, we can set the reminder with that lat/lon, but still need a timestamp. Since the user didn't specify a time, we need to ask for it.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. The ambiguity here is the missing timestamp. So even after getting the location, the timestamp is still required. Therefore, the assistant should first get the location, but since the timestamp is missing, perhaps the main ambiguity is the time.\n\nWait, but the user might intend the reminder to trigger when they arrive at the location, which would require the location coordinates, but the function still needs a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is a secondary condition. However, the function requires it, so it's mandatory.\n\nGiven all that, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Since the user didn't specify a time, ask for when they want the reminder.\n\nBut the user mentioned a location, so maybe the reminder is location-based, but the timestamp is still needed. Alternatively, the system might use the location to set a geofenced reminder, but the timestamp is a required parameter regardless.\n\nGiven the function's requirements, the assistant must have a timestamp. Therefore, the user's request is ambiguous because the time is missing. So the assistant should ask for the time.\n\nHowever, another angle: maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for the current time, but the instructions say not to assume. So better to ask.\n\nWait, but looking at the tools, there's get_current_timestamp. Maybe the assistant can get the current timestamp and use that as the reminder time. But the user might not want it right now. For example, they might want it tomorrow when they go shopping.\n\nSo the safe move is to ask for the time. Therefore, the assistant should respond with a request for the specific time the user wants the reminder.\n\nBut the problem says to use the tools if needed. However, in this case, since the timestamp is missing, and the user didn't provide it, the assistant can't proceed without it. So the correct action is to ask for clarification on the time.\n\nWait, but the user's message is to \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" The location is specified, but not the time. So the assistant needs to know when. So the response should be asking for the time.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. So the assistant should say something like, \"When would you like to be reminded? Please specify the date and time.\"\n\nHowever, the problem might expect using the tools to get the location first, then handle the timestamp. But without the timestamp, add_reminder can't be called. So perhaps the assistant should first get the location coordinates, then ask for the time.\n\nWait, but the add_reminder function requires reminder_timestamp, which is a POSIX timestamp. So even if we have the location, we still need the time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get lat/lon.\n\n2. Ask the user for the reminder time.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided time, so the assistant must ask. However, the problem says to use the tools if needed. Since the location is part of the reminder, we need to get the lat/lon for the reminder's location parameters.\n\nWait, the add_reminder function has optional lat/lon parameters. So the",

The user initially wanted to be reminded to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. Since they didn't specify a time at first, the assistant had to figure out the necessary details.\n\nFirst, the assistant called get_current_timestamp to know the current time. Then, converted that timestamp to datetime info to understand the current date and time (August 15, 2025, 3:36 AM). The user then specified \"tomorrow at 5 PM,\" so the assistant needed to calculate the timestamp for August 16, 2025, 5 PM. They used datetime_info_to_timestamp with the correct parameters to get 1755378000.0.\n\nNext, the assistant searched for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" using search_location_around_lat_lon. The response provided the latitude and longitude (37.3235879, -122.0396177) for the store in Cupertino.\n\nFinally, the add_reminder function was called with the content, the obtained coordinates, and the calculated timestamp. The response was a reminder ID, confirming the reminder was set.\n\nNow, the user's last message is the tool response with the reminder ID. The assistant needs to inform the user that the reminder has been successfully created, including the time and location details. They should mention the specific time (tomorrow at 5 PM), the location (Whole Foods Market on Stevens Creek Blvd), and maybe the reminder ID if relevant. Since the user might not need the ID, but it's good to confirm success. Also, check if they need anything else.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to buy chocolate milk has been set for **tomorrow at 5:00 PM** at **Whole Foods Market (20955 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA)**. The reminder will trigger when you're near this location. Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything! 🛒",
