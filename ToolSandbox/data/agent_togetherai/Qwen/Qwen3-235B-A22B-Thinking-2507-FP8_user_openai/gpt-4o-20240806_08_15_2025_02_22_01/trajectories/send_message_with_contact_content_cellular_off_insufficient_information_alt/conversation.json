The tools provided are get_cellular_service_status, send_message_with_phone_number, and set_cellular_service_status.\n\nHmm, the user is asking to send a message to Fredrik. So the relevant tool here is probably send_message_with_phone_number. But wait, the function requires a phone number and content. The user didn't provide a phone number for Fredrik. Oh, right, the problem statement says not to make assumptions about values. So I can't just guess his phone number. \n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because there's no phone number given. The function needs both phone_number and content. Since the phone number isn't specified, I should ask for clarification. But wait, maybe the system expects me to use another tool first? Let me check the other tools. The get_cellular_service_status and set_cellular_service_status don't seem related to sending a message. \n\nSo the correct action here is to point out that the phone number is missing. The user needs to provide it before I can send the message. Therefore, I shouldn't call any function yet and instead ask for the phone number.\n</think>\n\nThe request to send a message to Fredrik Thordendal requires a phone number, which was not provided. Please specify the recipient's phone number so I can assist with sending the message."

There's send_message_with_phone_number, which needs a phone number and content. But the user said they don't have the number.\n\nSo, without the phone number, I can't use that function. The other tools are get_cellular_service_status and set_cellular_service_status, but those don't help here. The user isn't asking about service status.\n\nHmm, maybe the user expects me to know the phone number, but I can't assume that. The instructions say not to make assumptions. So I should inform them that without the phone number, I can't send the message. Also, maybe suggest alternative ways to contact him, like through social media or official channels, but since the tools don't support that, I can only state the limitation.\n\nWait, the previous response already asked for the phone number, and the user replied they don't know it. So now I need to respond that it's not possible without the number. No other functions can help here. So the correct response is to explain that I can't send the message without the phone number and maybe suggest they find it through official sources.\n</think>\n\nWithout the recipient's phone number, I cannot send a message using the available tools. You may need to obtain Fredrik Thordendal's official contact information through his record label, social media, or official website to communicate with him directly. Let me know if you'd like assistance with anything else!"
