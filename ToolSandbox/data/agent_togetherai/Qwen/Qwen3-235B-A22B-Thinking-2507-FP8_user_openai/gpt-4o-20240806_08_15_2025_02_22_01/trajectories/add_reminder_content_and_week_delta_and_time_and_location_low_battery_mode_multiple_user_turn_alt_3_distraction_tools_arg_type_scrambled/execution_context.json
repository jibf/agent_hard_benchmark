                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are required. The main action here is adding a reminder, so the add_reminder function is necessary. The parameters needed for that are content, reminder_timestamp, and optionally latitude and longitude.\n\nThe content is straightforward: \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\". But the reminder_timestamp is a POSIX timestamp. The user didn't specify a time, so I need to ask for clarification. Wait, but maybe the user expects a default time? However, the function requires it, so I can't proceed without it. Wait, the user's message doesn't mention when they want the reminder. So I need to ask them when they want to be reminded. But the problem says not to make assumptions. Hmm.\n\nWait, the tools provided include datetime_info_to_timestamp and get_current_timestamp. Maybe I can use get_current_timestamp to get the current time and then set the reminder for a specific time? But the user didn't specify a time. Alternatively, maybe they want it immediately, but that doesn't make sense for a reminder. Wait, no—reminders usually have a specific time. Since the user didn't specify, I need to ask for the time. But according to the instructions, if the request is ambiguous, I should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the user said \"Add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods.\" They didn't mention when. So the reminder_timestamp is missing. The add_reminder function requires content and reminder_timestamp. So I can't call the function without knowing the timestamp. Therefore, I need to prompt the user to specify the time for the reminder.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user expects the reminder to be location-based. The function also allows latitude and longitude. To get the location of Whole Foods, I might need to use search_location_around_lat_lon. But first, I need the current location to search around. So steps would be:\n\n1. Get current location (get_current_location) to know where to search.\n2. Search for Whole Foods near current location (search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods\").\n3. Use the coordinates from the search result to set the reminder's latitude and longitude.\n4. But the user still needs to specify the time for the reminder.\n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided the time, so even if I get the location, the timestamp is missing. So the main issue is the missing timestamp. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user when they want the reminder. But the problem states that if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. Since the timestamp is required and not provided, I should ask for the time.\n\nWait, but maybe the user expects the reminder to trigger when they arrive at Whole Foods, which would be a location-based reminder. In that case, the reminder_timestamp might not be a specific time but tied to location. However, looking at the add_reminder function parameters, it requires reminder_timestamp as a POSIX timestamp. So even for location-based reminders, they still need a timestamp. That's confusing. Maybe the timestamp is the time when the reminder should be set, but if it's location-based, perhaps the timestamp is optional? Wait, no—the required fields are content and reminder_timestamp. So regardless of location, the timestamp is required.\n\nTherefore, the user must provide a time. Since they didn't, I need to ask for clarification. So the correct response is to prompt the user to specify the date and time for the reminder.\n</think>\n\nTo add your reminder, I need to know when you'd like to be reminded. Could you please specify the date and time for the reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods? For example: \"tomorrow at 3pm\" or \"next Monday at 10am\".",

The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods, set for tomorrow at 5 PM, and they want to make sure it's the correct Whole Foods.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. But to convert that into a POSIX timestamp, I need the current date and time. Wait, the user didn't specify the current date, but maybe I should get the current timestamp first. However, the function datetime_info_to_timestamp requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So I need to know today's date to calculate tomorrow.\n\nWait, maybe I should use get_current_timestamp first to find out the current time, then calculate tomorrow's date. But the user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\", so if today is, say, October 5th, then tomorrow is October 6th at 17:00.\n\nBut how do I get the current date? The get_current_timestamp function can give me the current POSIX timestamp, which I can then convert to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Then add one day to get tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the user might have said \"tomorrow\" relative to their current time. So steps needed:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to know today's date.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day, handling month/year rollover if needed).\n4. Set the time to 5 PM (17:00).\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp for the reminder.\n\nBut the user also mentioned \"Make sure it's the right Whole Foods.\" So they want the reminder to be location-based, probably at a specific Whole Foods store. To do that, I need the latitude and longitude of the correct Whole Foods.\n\nSo first, I need to find the current location (get_current_location) to use as a reference for searching nearby Whole Foods. Then use search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods\" to find the nearest one. Then use that location's lat/lon for the reminder.\n\nWait, the user said \"Make sure it's the right Whole Foods.\" So maybe they have a specific one in mind, but without more info, the best approach is to search around their current location to find the nearest Whole Foods and use that as the location for the reminder.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current location (latitude and longitude).\n2. Search for \"Whole Foods\" around that location.\n3. Take the first result (assuming it's the correct one) to get its lat/lon.\n4. Calculate the reminder timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n5. Add the reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\", timestamp, and the lat/lon from step 3.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the current time, so I need to get the current timestamp first. Wait, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp requires specific date parts. Maybe I should first get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then compute tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current POSIX timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current date and time.\n\nThen, calculate tomorrow's date: add 1 day to the current day. If the current day is the last day of the month, handle month rollover, etc. But since we're using the datetime functions, maybe the system can handle that, but since we're doing it manually here, perhaps we need to assume that adding 1 day is straightforward. However, the user might be in a timezone where tomorrow's date could be different, but POSIX timestamps are in UTC, so maybe we need to consider timezone, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's \"tomorrow at 5PM\" is in their local time, so we need to get the current local time, add one day, set to 17:00, then convert to POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut to do that accurately, we need the current local datetime. However, the tools provided don't have a function to get the current local time directly; we have get_current_timestamp which gives UTC time as a POSIX timestamp. So converting that to local time would require knowing the timezone, which we don't have. But maybe the system handles that internally, so when we convert the current timestamp to datetime info, it's in the user's local time.\n\nAssuming that timestamp_to_datetime_info returns the datetime in the user's local timezone, then:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n- Add 1 day to the day, adjusting month/year if necessary.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that datetime to POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut the problem is that adding 1 day might not be as simple as day+1, because of different month lengths. However, for the sake of this problem, maybe we can assume that the user's system can handle that, and the datetime_info_to_timestamp function will correctly compute the timestamp even if the day rolls over.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that to get current datetime.\n3. Increment the day by 1.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nThen, for the location:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get lat/lon.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods\", using the current lat/lon.\n3. Take the first result's lat/lon to set as the reminder's location.\n\nWait, but the user said \"Make sure it's the right Whole Foods.\" So maybe they want to confirm which one, but since the user didn't specify further, the assistant should proceed to use the nearest one.\n\nSo, first, get current location, then search for Whole Foods around there, get the coordinates, then set the reminder with those coordinates.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any specific details about which Whole Foods, so the assistant has to assume the nearest one is the correct one.\n\nSo the tool calls needed are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp (to calculate tomorrow's timestamp)\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info (to get current date parts)\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp (to convert tomorrow's date to timestamp)\n- get_current_location (to find current lat/lon)\n- search_location_around_lat_lon (to find Whole Foods near current location)\n\nWait, but the user said \"Tomorrow at 5PM\", so the timestamp calculation is necessary. Let's outline the sequence:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time in POSIX.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date: day + 1, adjusting if necessary (but maybe the functions handle it).\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert that datetime to POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut to do step 2, we need to call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n\nThen, for the location:\n\n6. Call get_current_location to get current lat/lon.\n7. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods\" and the current lat/lon to find the store.\n\nThen, add_reminder with content, timestamp from step 5, and lat/lon from step 7.\n\nSo the tool calls would be:\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nThen, datetime_info_to_timestamp with the adjusted date.\n\nThen, get_current_location.\n\nThen, search_location_around_lat_lon.\n\nBut the user's message is \"Tomorrow at 5PM. Make sure it's the right Whole Foods.\"\n\nSo the assistant needs to make multiple tool calls. However, in the response, the assistant should output the tool calls step by step.\n\nWait, the user's latest message is providing the time, so the assistant needs to proceed to set up the reminder.\n\nSo first, to get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow.\n\nBut the assistant can't assume the current date, so it needs to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that to datetime info.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the assistant can't do calculations itself; it has to use the tools. Wait, the tools include datetime_info_to_timestamp and timestamp_to_datetime_info, which can be used to convert between timestamp and date parts.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current date/time components.\n3. Modify the date components to be tomorrow at 5 PM.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the modified components to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nThen, for location:\n\n5. Call get_current_location to get current coordinates.\n6. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods\" to find the store.\n\nThen, add_reminder with the content, timestamp, and location coordinates.\n\nSo the tool calls needed are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp\n- timestamp_to_datetime_info (with the result of get_current_timestamp)\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp (with modified date)\n- get_current_location\n- search_location_around_lat_lon (with location \"Whole Foods\")\n- add_reminder (with all the gathered info)\n\nBut the assistant has to make these calls step by step. However, in the context of the problem, the assistant is supposed to output the tool calls in the order they need to be made.\n\nWait, but the user's message is the second part: \"Tomorrow at 5PM. Make sure it's the right Whole Foods.\"\n\nThe assistant needs to generate the necessary tool calls to fulfill",
