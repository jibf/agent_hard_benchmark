The add_reminder function requires content and reminder_timestamp. The content is \"buy chocolate milk\", but I don't have a timestamp yet. The user didn't specify when they want the reminder. Hmm, the problem says not to make assumptions, so I should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects a default time, but the instructions say not to assume. So I need to ask when they want the reminder. Let me check the tools again. There's get_current_timestamp, but that's for the current time. Maybe the user meant now, but they might want a specific time. Since the required parameters for add_reminder include reminder_timestamp, I can't proceed without it. So I should prompt the user to specify the date and time for the reminder.\n</think>\n\nTo set up your reminder to buy chocolate milk, I'll need to know when you'd like to be reminded. Could you please specify the date and time (e.g., \"tomorrow at 3pm\", \"next Monday at 9am\")? This will help me schedule the reminder accurately."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to convert \"tomorrow at 5PM\" into a POSIX timestamp. But wait, I don't know the current date. Maybe I should get the current timestamp first to determine what \"tomorrow\" is. Let me check the available tools.\n\nThere's a function called get_current_timestamp that gives the current POSIX timestamp. So I should call that first. Once I have the current timestamp, I can calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\". Assuming today is, say, October 5th, tomorrow would be October 6th. But without knowing the current date, I can't be precise. So getting the current timestamp is essential.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can use shift_timestamp to add one day and set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shift_timestamp can add days, hours, etc. Let me see. If the current time is, for example, 10 AM today, adding 1 day would make it 10 AM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So maybe I need to adjust hours as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to find out today's date, then set the reminder for tomorrow at 17:00 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24-hour format). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst step: Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current year, month, day, etc. Then, calculate tomorrow's date by adding one day. But if today is the last day of the month, adding a day would roll over to the next month, etc. However, the tools provided might handle that if I use shift_timestamp.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function can shift by days. So if I take the current timestamp and add 1 day, that would give me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM, which might not be the same as the current time. For example, if it's currently 3 PM, adding 1 day would be 3 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So I need to adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to take the current timestamp, shift it to tomorrow at 5 PM. How?\n\nAlternatively, use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But to use that, I need the specific year, month, day, hour, etc. So first, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, then increment the day by 1, set hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get current date and time components.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (tomorrow).\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new values to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nBut wait, what if tomorrow is in the next month or year? The timestamp_to_datetime_info would handle that, but when incrementing the day, I need to make sure it's correctly calculated. However, using shift_timestamp might be easier. Wait, shift_timestamp can add days. Let's see:\n\nSuppose current timestamp is T. If I add 1 day, that's T + 86400 seconds. But that would be the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM, regardless of the current time. So if the current time is 10 AM, adding 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow. But user wants 5 PM, so need to adjust the time.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = current day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems right. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Create new datetime info for tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n4. Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the day increment? For example, if today is the 31st of a month with 31 days, tomorrow would be the 1st of the next month. The timestamp_to_datetime_info would handle that when converting, but when manually incrementing, I need to be careful. However, using the shift_timestamp function might handle the rollover correctly.\n\nWait, maybe use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then adjust the time to 5 PM. Let's think.\n\nSuppose current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:00 (2:30 PM). Adding 1 day gives 2023-10-06 14:30:00. But user wants 17:00:00 on the 6th. So need to subtract 14.5 hours and add 17 hours? Wait, no. Maybe better to set the time to 17:00:00 on the next day.\n\nAlternative approach: Take the current timestamp, shift it to the start of tomorrow (midnight), then add 17 hours.\n\nBut how to get the start of tomorrow? Maybe:\n\ncurrent_timestamp -> get current datetime info.\n\ntomorrow_midnight = current year, month, day+1, 0,0,0.\n\nBut if day+1 exceeds days in month, it should roll over. But perhaps using shift_timestamp to add 1 day and then set the time.\n\nWait, maybe the easiest way is:\n\ncurrent_timestamp -> get current datetime info.\n\nnew_datetime = {\n  year: current_year,\n  month: current_month,\n  day: current_day +1,\n  hour:17,\n  minute:0,\n  second:0\n}\n\nBut if current_day is 31 and month is April (30 days), this would be invalid. So better to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then adjust the time.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Shift T by +1 day to get T_tomorrow_same_time.\n3. Convert T_tomorrow_same_time to datetime info.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut that would give tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nWait, no. If T is today at 14:30, T_tomorrow_same_time is tomorrow at 14:30. Converting to datetime info gives year, month, day, 14, 30, 0. Then set hour=17, so it becomes 17:30:00? Wait, no. Wait, if I take T_tomorrow_same_time, which is tomorrow at 14:30, and then change the hour to 17, it would be tomorrow at 17:30. But the user wants 17:00. So perhaps better to take the start of tomorrow (midnight) and add 17 hours.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift to tomorrow at midnight: shift current timestamp by +1 day, then set time to 00:00:00.\n- Then add 17 hours.\n\nBut how to get midnight? Maybe:\n\ncurrent_timestamp -> get datetime info.\n\nmidnight_tomorrow = datetime_info_to_timestamp with day=current_day+1, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut again, handling month/year rollover.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then subtract the current time's hours, minutes, seconds to get to midnight, then add 17 hours.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date/time components.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date by adding 1 to the day, handling month/year rollover (but the tool might handle it when converting back).\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new values.\n\nBut the problem is step 3: how to increment the day correctly. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives the current day, so adding 1 to the day might not account for month boundaries. For example, if today is January 31, adding 1 day would be February 1. But if we just increment day to 32, it's invalid. So perhaps the correct way is to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, here's a better plan:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by +1 day to get T_tomorrow (same time as now, but tomorrow).\n- Convert T_tomorrow to datetime info.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, no. Because T_tomorrow is same time tomorrow. For example, if now is 14:30, T_tomorrow is 14:30 tomorrow. Converting to datetime info gives hour=14, minute=30. If we set hour=17, minute=0, then the new time is 17:00 tomorrow. But the difference between "
