They just said \"he's in my contacts.\" Maybe they expect me to ask for the name of the contact. But the user hasn't provided the name yet. So I need to prompt them for the contact's name to search the contacts database.\n\nLet me check the tools again. The search_contacts function allows searching by name (fuzzy match), phone number (exact), relationship, etc. Since the user doesn't have the phone number, but knows the person is in contacts, I should use search_contacts with the name. But the user hasn't given the name yet. So I need to ask for the contact's name to proceed.\n\nWait, the user's message says \"I don't know his phone number, just that he's in my contacts.\" So they know the person's name, probably. But they didn't state it. So the next step is to ask for the contact's name to search for their phone number.\n\nTherefore, I should respond by requesting the name of the contact so I can look up their phone number using search_contacts. Once I have the phone number, then I can send the message.\n</think>\n\nTo send the message to your contact, I'll need to look up their phone number from your contacts. Could you please provide the **name of the contact** you want to message?

Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, they didn't know the phone number, so I used search_contacts with the name Fredrik Thordendal. Found the contact with phone number +12453344098. Then tried to send the message, but got an error about cellular service not being enabled.\n\nNext, I called get_cellular_service_status, which returned False. So cellular is off. The user needs to enable it to send the message. The available functions include set_cellular_service_status with a boolean 'on' parameter.\n\nSo the next step is to prompt the user if they want to enable cellular service. If they agree, call set_cellular_service_status with on=True. Then retry sending the message.\n\nWait, the user might not know they need cellular on. Since the error is because cellular is disabled, the assistant should explain that and ask for permission to turn it on. Let me check the tools again. Yes, there's set_cellular_service_status. So the correct action is to inform the user, ask if they want to enable cellular, and if yes, enable it and then send the message.\n\nIn the current state, after getting the status as False, the assistant should generate a response asking the user to confirm enabling cellular. Then, if confirmed, make the tool call to set it to on, then send the message again.\n</think>\n\nTo send the message, cellular service must be enabled. Would you like me to **turn on cellular service** now? This is required to send SMS messages.  \n\n*(I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding)*",

The user initially wanted to send a message but didn't know the phone number, only that the contact was in their contacts. They provided the contact name, Fredrik Thordendal.\n\nFirst, I used the search_contacts function to find Fredrik's details. The response gave the phone number. Then, I tried to send the message using send_message_with_phone_number, but got a ConnectionError because cellular service wasn't enabled.\n\nNext, I checked the cellular service status with get_cellular_service_status, which returned False. So, I asked the user if they wanted to enable it, and they agreed. I called set_cellular_service_status with on: true. After that, I tried sending the message again, and it worked, returning a message ID.\n\nNow, the user probably wants confirmation that the message was sent successfully. The final step is to inform them that the message was sent and maybe provide the message ID for reference. I should make sure to mention that cellular service is now on, in case they need to know for future actions.\n</think>\n\nThe message has been successfully sent to Fredrik Thordendal! 🎸  \n**Message ID:** `5b42a7a3-3a6e-4002-8cf8-fae7a89d5cdc`  \n*(Cellular service remains enabled to support ongoing communication)*",
