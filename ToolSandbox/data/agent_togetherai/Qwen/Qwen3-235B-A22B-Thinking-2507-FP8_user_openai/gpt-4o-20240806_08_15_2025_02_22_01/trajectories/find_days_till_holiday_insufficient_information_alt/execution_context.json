The response was 1766638800.0, which is a POSIX timestamp.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what that timestamp corresponds to. Let me check what date that is. Converting 1766638800 to a human-readable date. Let me calculate. POSIX timestamps are seconds since January 1, 1970.\n\nLet me see, 1766638800 divided by 60 is minutes, then by 60 again for hours, then by 24 for days. But maybe it's easier to use a converter. Wait, maybe I can recall that 1766638800 is December 25, 2025, at 00:00:00 UTC? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the current year when the user asked might be important. The user didn't specify a year, so the function defaults to the current year. But the response is 1766638800. Let me verify the date.\n\nLet me check an online converter or calculate. Let's see, the timestamp for December 25, 2024, would be 1735102800 (since 2024-12-25 00:00:00 UTC is 1735102800). Wait, 1766638800 is higher. Let's see, 1766638800 - 1735102800 = 31536000, which is exactly one year (365 days * 86400 seconds). So 1766638800 would be December 25, 2025. Wait, but if the current year is 2023, then the function defaults to 2023, but the response is 2025? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the current year when the user asked is 2024? Wait, perhaps the system's current year is 2024, so when the user didn't specify a year, it defaults to 2024, but the response is 1766638800, which is 2025-12-25. Wait, that would mean the user is asking in 2024, and Christmas is in 2025? But Christmas is December 25 every year. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the timestamp 1766638800. Let's convert it. Let's take the current date. Suppose today is October 26, 2023. The timestamp for December 25, 2023, would be 1703481600 (approx). But 1766638800 is way higher. Let me calculate the year.\n\nThe number of seconds in a year is about 31536000 (non-leap year). Let's divide 1766638800 by 31536000. 1766638800 / 31536000 ≈ 56. So 1970 + 56 = 2026. Wait, but that's approximate. Let me do it more accurately.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2023 is 53 years. 53 * 31536000 = 1,671,408,000. 1,766,638,800 - 1,671,408,000 = 95,230,800 seconds. 95,230,800 / 86400 ≈ 1102 days. 1102 days is about 3 years (3*365=1095). So 2023 + 3 = 2026. Wait, but 1102 - 1095 = 7 days. So 2026-01-07? That doesn't make sense. Maybe better to use a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 1700000000 is around October 13, 2023. So 1,766,638,800 is 66,638,800 seconds after that. 66,638,800 / 86400 ≈ 771 days. 771 days from October 13, 2023, is roughly October 13, 2023 + 2 years and 15 days (since 730 days is 2 years), so about October 28, 2025. But the timestamp is for Christmas Day, which is December 25. Hmm, maybe my approach is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function returned the timestamp for December 25, 2025. Let's check: December 25, 2025, 00:00:00 UTC. Let's compute that timestamp.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2025 is 55 years. Number of leap years between 1970 and 2025: 1972, 1976, ..., 2024. That's (2024-1972)/4 +1 = (52)/4 +1=13+1=14. So total days: 55*365 +14 = 20075 +14=20089 days. Total seconds: 20089 *86400 = 1,735,689,600. Wait, but December 25 is the 359th day of 2025 (since 2025 is not a leap year). Wait, January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 25.\n\nCalculating days up to December 25, 2025:\n\n31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+25 = let's add step by step:\n\nJan:31, total 31\n\nFeb:28, total 59\n\nMar:31, 90\n\nApr:30, 120\n\nMay:31, 151\n\nJun:30, 181\n\nJul:31, 212\n\nAug:31, 243\n\nSep:30, 273\n\nOct:31, 304\n\nNov:30, 334\n\nDec 25: 334 +25=359.\n\nSo total days from 1970-01-01 to 2025-12-25 is (2025-1970)*365 + number of leap years up to 2025 - days before 2025.\n\nWait, maybe better to use a known reference. For example, January 1, 2024, is 1704067200. Then December 25, 2024, would be 1703481600? Wait, no. Wait, January 1, 2024, 00:00:00 UTC is 1704067200. Then December 25, 2024, is 359 days into the year (since 2024 is a leap year, but December 25 is before February 29, so days up to Dec 25 is 359? Wait, 2024 is a leap year, so February has 29 days. Let's recalculate for 2024:\n\nJan:31, Feb:29, Mar:31, Apr:30, May:31, Jun:30, Jul:31, Aug:31, Sep:30, Oct:31, Nov:30, Dec 25.\n\n31+29=60, +31=91, +30=121, +31=152, +30=182, +31=213, +31=244, +30=274, +3",
