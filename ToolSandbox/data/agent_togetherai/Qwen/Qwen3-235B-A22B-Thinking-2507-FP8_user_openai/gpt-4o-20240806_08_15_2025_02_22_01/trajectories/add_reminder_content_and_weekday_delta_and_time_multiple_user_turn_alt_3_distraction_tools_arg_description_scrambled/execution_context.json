                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder for next Friday at 5 PM. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what \"next Friday\" means. Since the current timestamp is given as 1755239791.429001, which I should convert to a date to know the current day. Wait, maybe I should use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current date and time.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"next Friday\". If today is, say, Wednesday, next Friday would be in two days. But if today is Friday, then next Friday is seven days later. So I need to find out the current day of the week.\n\nSo first, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp to get the current date components, especially the isoweekday (which is 1-7, Monday to Sunday). Let me check the functions available. Yes, there's timestamp_to_datetime_info that returns year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and isoweekday.\n\nSo step 1: Convert current timestamp to datetime info to know the current day.\n\nOnce I have the current day, calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Monday (isoweekday 1), next Friday is 4 days later. If today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\", which typically means the upcoming Friday, even if today is Friday. So if today is Friday, next Friday is in 7 days. If today is Saturday, next Friday is in 6 days, etc.\n\nSo the formula would be: target_weekday = 5 (since Friday is 5 in isoweekday). Current weekday is current_day.\n\nDays until next Friday = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If current_day is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7) %7 = 7%7=0, but we want 7 days, so maybe adjust. Wait, (5 - current_day) %7. If current_day is 5, then 0, but we need 7. So maybe (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Let's test:\n\nIf current_day is 5 (Friday), (5-5 +7)=7, 7%7=0. Hmm, but we need 7 days. So perhaps if the result is 0, add 7. So days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. If that's 0, then 7, else the result.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): (5-5)=0 → 0, but next Friday is 7 days later. So days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If 0, then 7. So days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Wait, (5 -5 +7)=7 → 7%7=0. So maybe days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. If 0, then 7, else the value.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. If it's 0, then 7. Otherwise, the result.\n\nSo once I have days_to_add, I can calculate the target date.\n\nBut first, I need to get the current datetime info.\n\nSo first tool call: timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp (1755239791.429001).\n\nLet me simulate that. Suppose the current timestamp is 1755239791.429001. Let me convert that to a date. Wait, but maybe I don't need to know the exact date, just the weekday.\n\nBut for the function, I need to pass the timestamp to get the isoweekday.\n\nSo the next step is to call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp to get the current day of the week.\n\nOnce I have that, compute the days until next Friday, then set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday 5PM\". So the time is 17:00 (5 PM in 24h format).\n\nSo after calculating the date for next Friday, set the hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info) to find current day.\n\n2. Calculate days to next Friday.\n\n3. Calculate the target date (current date + days_to_add).\n\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n\n6. Call add_reminder with content and the timestamp.\n\nBut to do step 3 and 4, I need to adjust the current date by days_to_add and set the time.\n\nWait, but how to construct the target datetime.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce I have the current datetime components (year, month, day, etc.), calculate the target day.\n\nFor example, if current day is Monday (1), days_to_add is 4 (to get to Friday 5). So target_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle month and year rollover, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle adding days.\n\nWait, there's a shift_timestamp function that can shift a timestamp by days, hours, etc.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (already done, 1755239791.429001).\n\n- Get current datetime info to find current weekday.\n\n- Calculate days_to_add to next Friday.\n\n- Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, and set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would get to the correct date, but the time would still be the current time. So need to adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nHmm, maybe better to:\n\n1. Calculate the target date as next Friday at 17:00:00.\n\nTo do that:\n\n- From current datetime, find how many days until next Friday.\n\n- Then, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse datetime_info_to_timestamp to construct the target datetime.\n\nBut for that, I need the year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current datetime info (year, month, day, isoweekday).\n\n- Calculate days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) %7. If 0, then 7.\n\nWait, example:\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=5 (Friday), days_to_add = (5-5 +7)%7=7%7=0 → so days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=6 (Saturday), days_to_add=(5-6 +7)=6 → 6 days.\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=4 (Thursday), days_to_add=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) %7.\n\nIf the result is 0, set to 7.\n\nWait, (5 - current_isoweekday) %7 gives the days to next Friday, but if current is Friday, it's 0, which would mean same day, but user said \"next Friday\", so it should be 7 days later.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) %7.\n\nIf days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nWait, (5 - current_isoweekday +7) %7:\n\nIf current_isoweekday=5 → (5-5+7)=7 → 7%7=0 → days_to_add=0. But we need 7, so days_to_add = 7 if 0 else days_to_add.\n\nYes.\n\nSo once days_to_add is calculated, target_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle month/year changes, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle adding days.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (already done, 1755239791.429001).\n\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add as above.\n\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, and set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_to_add days would move the date to next Friday, but the time would still be the current time. So need to adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting by days_to_add days, set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach:\n\n- Take the current timestamp.\n\n- Shift it by days_to_add days to get to the correct date (but time is current time).\n\n- Then, shift it by (17 - current_hour) hours, but if current_hour is after 17, need to subtract, but this complicates.\n\nWait, maybe better to:\n\nOnce we have the target date (next Friday), set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nTo do that, perhaps:\n\n- Use the current datetime info to get year, month, day.\n\n- Add days_to_add to the day.\n\n- Then, set hour=17, minute",
