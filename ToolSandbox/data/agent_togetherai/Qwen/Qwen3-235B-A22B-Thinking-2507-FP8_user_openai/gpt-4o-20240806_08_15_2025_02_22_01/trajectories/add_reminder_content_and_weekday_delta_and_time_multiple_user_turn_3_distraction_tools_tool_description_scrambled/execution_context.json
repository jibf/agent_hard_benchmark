The user didn't specify when, so I should ask for clarification. Wait, the instructions say not to make assumptions. So I can't just pick a time. But maybe the user expects a default time, like today at a certain hour? Hmm, but the rules say don't assume. So I need to ask when they want the reminder.\n\nWait, the tools include get_current_timestamp and datetime_info_to_timestamp. Maybe the user expects me to set it for a specific time, but since they didn't specify, I need to prompt them. Let me check the user's message again: \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk\". No time mentioned. So I should ask for the time. But the assistant is supposed to use the tools. Wait, maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for now? But that doesn't make sense because a reminder is for the future. So I need to clarify the time.\n\nWait, the problem says if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. So I should respond by asking when they want to be reminded. But the user might expect the assistant to use a tool. Wait, but without the timestamp, I can't call add_reminder. So the correct step is to ask the user for the time they want the reminder. Therefore, I shouldn't make a tool call yet.

First, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for that time.\n\nI should use the get_current_timestamp function to know the current time. Then, determine what \"next Friday\" means. If today is, say, Tuesday, next Friday would be in 3 days. But if today is already Friday, it might mean the following Friday. Wait, the user said \"next Friday\", which usually refers to the upcoming Friday, even if today is Friday. Hmm, but sometimes people mean the next occurrence after today. So if today is Friday, \"next Friday\" would be in 7 days. But I need to calculate that.\n\nWait, maybe using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function would help, but I need to know the exact date. Alternatively, shift_timestamp could be used once I have the current timestamp. Let me check the available tools.\n\nThe tools include get_current_timestamp, which gives the current POSIX timestamp. Then shift_timestamp can adjust it by weeks, days, etc. But to get to next Friday at 5PM, I need to calculate the days until the next Friday.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp. Then find the day of the week. Suppose current day is Monday (1), then Friday is 5, so 4 days later. If current day is Friday (5), then next Friday is 7 days later. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp by calculating the correct year, month, day, hour, etc. But without knowing the current date, I can't compute the exact date for next Friday. So first, I need to get the current timestamp.\n\nWait, the user said \"Next Friday at 5PM\". So first, get the current timestamp. Then determine the next Friday. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to find the current day of the week.\n3. Calculate how many days to add to reach next Friday.\n4. Set the time to 5 PM (17:00).\n5. Create the timestamp for that date and time.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to get the day of the week directly. Wait, there's timestamp_to_datetime_info which can convert a timestamp to year, month, day, hour, etc. So steps would be:\n\n- Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n- Convert that to datetime info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current timestamp).\n- From the datetime info, get the current weekday (assuming the function returns it, but the parameters for timestamp_to_datetime_info don't specify. Wait, the parameters for timestamp_to_datetime_info are just the timestamp, and it returns the datetime info. The description says it returns a float POSIX timestamp, but the parameters require a timestamp. Wait, no: the function timestamp_to_datetime_info takes a timestamp and returns the datetime components. So the response would include year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and probably the day of the week.\n\nAssuming that, once I have the current datetime info, I can compute the days until next Friday.\n\nFor example, if today is Wednesday (3), then Friday is in 2 days. If today is Friday (5), then next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current day of week.\n3. Calculate days to add: (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If current_day is Friday (5), then (5-5 +7)%7 = 7%7=0, but we want 7 days, so maybe (5 - current_day + 7) %7, but if 0, add 7. Wait, perhaps better to do: days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7; if days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nWait, let's say current_day is 5 (Friday), then (5-5)=0, 0 +7=7, 7%7=0. So days_to_add is 0, but we need 7 days. So maybe days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7; if days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7; if days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nOnce days_to_add is calculated, then set the time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nBut also, need to adjust the hour and minute. So after adding the days, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n- Current timestamp → current datetime.\n- Compute target date: current date + days_to_add days.\n- Set time to 17:00:00.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to do this with the available tools?\n\nThe tools have shift_timestamp, which can shift by weeks, days, hours, etc. So perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info to find current day of week (call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current timestamp).\n3. Calculate days to add to reach next Friday.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by the calculated days, and set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp allows shifting by days, hours, etc. So if we need to add, say, 3 days and set the time to 17:00, but the current time is, for example, 10:00 AM, then shifting by 3 days would keep the same time (10 AM), so we need to adjust the time as well.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting the days, adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nBut how? Maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift by days_to_add days.\n- Then shift by (17 - current_hour) hours, but if current_hour is after 17, then days_to_add +1 and set to 17.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is:\n\nOnce we have the current datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second), compute the target date:\n\ntarget_day = current_day + days_to_add\n\nBut need to handle month and year rollover, which is tricky. Alternatively, use the shift_timestamp function to add the necessary days, then adjust the time.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So for example, if today is Wednesday, and we need to get to Friday (2 days later), then shift by 2 days. Then, set the time to 17:00.\n\nBut how to set the time? Because shifting by days keeps the same time. So if the current time is 10 AM, shifting by 2 days would be Friday at 10 AM. We need to change the time to 5 PM.\n\nSo after shifting days, we need to adjust the hours. For example, if current hour is 10, we need to add 7 hours (17-10=7). But if current hour is 18 (6 PM), then adding days_to_add +1 days and set to 17:00.\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Maybe the best way is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current hour, minute, etc.\n3. Calculate the target date and time as next Friday at 5 PM.\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create the timestamp for that date and time.\n\nBut to do that, we need to know the exact year, month, day for next Friday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, weekday).\n- Determine how many days to add to reach next Friday.\n- Add those days to current day, adjusting month and year if necessary.\n- Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that datetime to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the problem is, without knowing the current date, I can't compute the exact date for next Friday. So first, I need to get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current date and time components.\n\nThen calculate the target date.\n\nFor example, suppose current datetime is 2023-10-05 (Thursday), then next Friday is 2023-10-06.\n\nWait, no: if today is Thursday (4), next Friday is tomorrow (1 day later). If today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nSo the calculation is: days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) %7. If current_weekday is Friday (5), then (5-5 +7)=7, 7%7=0, so days_to_add=0, but we need 7 days. So days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) %7; if days_to_add ==0, then 7, else days_to_add.\n\nOnce days_to_add is calculated, add that to current day.\n\nThen, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo the target datetime is current_date + days_to_add days, time 17:00:00.\n\nOnce that's calculated, use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the POSIX timestamp.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1.
