                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"How many km to Golden Gate Bridge?\" So, I need to figure out what they're really asking for. They probably want to know the distance from their current location to the Golden Gate Bridge in kilometers.\n\nFirst, I should check if I have the necessary tools to get this information. Looking at the provided functions, there's a few related to location. The get_current_location function can retrieve the user's current latitude and longitude. Then, the search_location_around_lat_lon function can search for a location like the Golden Gate Bridge. Once I have both coordinates, I can use calculate_lat_lon_distance to find the distance between them.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify their current location. So the first step is to get their current coordinates. I'll need to call get_current_location. Once I have that, I can search for the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates using search_location_around_lat_lon with the location parameter set to \"Golden Gate Bridge\". But wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function requires a location string, which is provided. However, it also takes optional latitude and longitude parameters, which default to current if not provided. But since I need the exact coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge, maybe I should first get the current location, then search for the bridge's coordinates.\n\nWait, actually, the search_location_around_lat_lon function might return the bridge's latitude and longitude. So steps would be:\n\n1. Get current location (lat, lon) via get_current_location.\n2. Search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" using search_location_around_lat_lon. But the parameters for that function require a location string, and optionally lat/lon to search around. However, if I don't provide lat/lon, it defaults to current. But since the user is asking for the distance from their current location to the bridge, maybe the search will return the bridge's coordinates. Wait, but the search_location_around_lat_lon function's description says it searches around a given lat/lon for a location. So if I use the user's current lat/lon, it might not find the bridge if they're far away. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon can be used without current location to find the bridge's coordinates. Wait, the parameters say that if latitude and longitude are not provided, it defaults to current location. But if the user is not near the bridge, searching around their current location might not find it. So maybe another approach is needed.\n\nWait, there's also the search_lat_lon function, which takes latitude and longitude to get the address. But that's the opposite; we have the address and need the coordinates. So perhaps the correct way is to use search_location_around_lat_lon with the location set to \"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without providing lat/lon, but the function requires location as a parameter. Wait, the required parameter is \"location\", so we can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", and since lat/lon are optional, maybe it will search globally. But the description says \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location\", so if we don't provide lat/lon, it defaults to current. But if the user is not near the bridge, this might not work. However, maybe the function can still find the bridge even if it's far, but the description says \"around\", which implies proximity. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can be called with just the location parameter, and it will return the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge regardless of the user's current location. Let's assume that. So first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" to get its latitude and longitude. Then, get the user's current location, and then calculate the distance between the two points.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the distance from their current location to the bridge. So steps:\n\n1. Get user's current lat/lon via get_current_location.\n2. Get Golden Gate Bridge's lat/lon via search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\".\n3. Use calculate_lat_lon_distance with the two sets of coordinates to get the distance in kilometers.\n\nBut the problem is, the search_location_around_lat_lon function's parameters require location, and optionally lat/lon. If we don't provide lat/lon, it defaults to current. But if the user is in New York, searching around their current location for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" might not return anything. So perhaps the correct approach is to call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without specifying lat/lon, but the function might not return the correct coordinates if it's designed to search only around the current location. This is a bit of a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another function. Wait, looking back, there's also search_lat_lon, but that's for getting address from lat/lon, which isn't helpful here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the intended way is to first get the current location, then search for the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates. Wait, but how? The search_location_around_lat_lon function's description says it can take a location string like a business name. So perhaps even without current lat/lon, providing the location as \"Golden Gate Bridge\" would return its coordinates. Let me check the function description again:\n\n\"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nAh, so if latitude and longitude are not provided, it defaults to current location. But if the user is not near the Golden Gate Bridge, searching around their current location might not find it. However, maybe the search is global, and \"around\" is just the starting point. Or perhaps the function is designed to find the location regardless, but the description is a bit unclear.\n\nGiven that the user is asking for the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a well-known landmark, it's safe to assume that the search_location_around_lat_lon function can find it even if the user is far away. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get user's current lat/lon.\n2. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" (without lat/lon, so it defaults to current, but maybe the function can still find it globally).\n3. From the search result, extract the bridge's lat/lon.\n4. Use calculate_lat_lon_distance with user's current and bridge's coordinates to get the distance.\n\nBut wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon might return multiple results, but the Golden Gate Bridge is unique enough that it should return the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function requires the lat/lon to search around, but since we don't have that for the bridge, perhaps we need to use another method. Wait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can be called with just the location parameter, and it will return the coordinates of the location regardless of the user's current position. The description says \"When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" So if we don't provide lat/lon, it uses current. But if the user is in San Francisco, it would find the bridge. If they're elsewhere, maybe it still finds the bridge as the primary result. Maybe the function is designed to find the most relevant location even if it's not nearby.\n\nAssuming that, the plan is:\n\n- Get current location (lat, lon) of user.\n- Search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" using search_location_around_lat_lon (without providing lat/lon, so it uses current, but perhaps the search is global).\n- From the search result, get the bridge's coordinates.\n- Calculate the distance between user's current and bridge's coordinates.\n\nWait, but if the user is not near the bridge, searching around their current location might not return the bridge. For example, if the user is in London, searching around London for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" probably won't find it. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be called without lat/lon parameters, but the description says they default to current. So perhaps there's no way to search globally. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the function search_location_around_lat_lon is intended to search for locations near a given point, but if you want to find a specific location like the Golden Gate Bridge, you need to know its coordinates already. But the user doesn't have that. So maybe there's another function.\n\nWait, looking again, there's the search_lat_lon function, but that's for getting an address from coordinates, not the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can be used with a location name to get its coordinates, even without current lat/lon. Wait, the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon require \"location\" as a required parameter, and lat/lon are optional. So perhaps even if lat/lon are not provided, it can still search for the location globally. The description says \"When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" So if we don't provide lat/lon, it uses current, but the search might still return the Golden Gate Bridge if it's the top result, even if it's far away. But that's not how location searches usually work; typically, they prioritize nearby results.\n\nThis is a bit of a dead end. Maybe the correct approach is to first get the current location, then search for the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon function",

Then I searched for the Golden Gate Bridge and found its coordinates at 37.8199109, -122.4785598. Using the calculate_lat_lon_distance function, the distance came out to approximately 67.98 kilometers.\n\nWait, but the user probably expects the answer in a more user-friendly format. Let me check if the distance makes sense. San Francisco is where the Golden Gate Bridge is, and the current location's coordinates (37.33, -122.01) are near San Jose, which is about 60-70 km south of San Francisco. So 67.98 km sounds right.\n\nI should present the answer clearly, rounding to a reasonable decimal place, maybe two. So 68.0 km or 67.98 km. Since the user asked for kilometers, and the function returned a precise number, but typically people might round it. Let me confirm the calculation. The Haversine formula gives the great-circle distance, which this function likely uses. The result seems accurate.\n\nSo the final answer is approximately 68 kilometers. I'll state that clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe distance from your current location to the Golden Gate Bridge is approximately **68.0 kilometers**.",
