First, I tried to turn on cellular service using set_cellular_service_status with on: true. But got a PermissionError saying it can't be turned on in low battery mode.\n\nSo, next step was to check the low battery mode status. I called get_low_battery_mode_status, and the response was True. That means low battery mode is active, which is preventing the cellular service from turning on.\n\nNow, the user probably needs to disable low battery mode to enable cellular. But wait, maybe they want to know why it's not working. The error message says it's because of low battery mode. So, I should inform them that low battery mode is on, which is blocking cellular. Then, ask if they want to turn off low battery mode to enable cellular service.\n\nBut the user's original request was to get the cellphone signal on. Since low battery mode is on, the solution is to disable low battery mode first. However, the user might not know about this dependency. So, I need to explain the situation and get their permission to turn off low battery mode.\n\nWait, the tools available include set_low_battery_mode_status. So, if the user agrees, I can call that function with on: false. But first, I need to check if they want to proceed. Since the assistant can't make decisions for the user, it's necessary to prompt them.\n\nSo the next step is to tell the user that low battery mode is active, which is preventing cellular from turning on. Then ask if they want to disable low battery mode to enable cellular service. If they say yes, then call set_low_battery_mode_status with on: false, and then try setting cellular again.\n\nBut in the current context, after getting the low battery mode status as True, the assistant should respond with this information and ask for confirmation. So the next tool call isn't automatic; it requires user input. Therefore, the assistant should generate a message explaining the issue and requesting permission to proceed.\n</think>\n\nLow battery mode is currently enabled, which is preventing cellular service from turning on. Would you like me to disable low battery mode to restore cellular signal? This may increase battery usage."
