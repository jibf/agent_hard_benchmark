But wait, the user didn't provide a phone number for Fredrik. Hmm, that's a problem. The function needs the phone number to send the message.\n\nWait, maybe Fredrik's phone number is stored somewhere else, but the user hasn't given it here. The tools don't have a function to look up contacts by name. The search_messages function can search by sender or recipient IDs or phone numbers, but that's for existing messages, not for finding contact info.\n\nSo, since the user didn't specify the phone number, I can't use send_message_with_phone_number because it's required. The function requires both phone_number and content. Without the phone number, I can't proceed. \n\nI should check if there's another function that might help. Maybe get_current_location or something else, but that doesn't seem relevant here. The user is trying to send a message, so the only applicable function is send_message_with_phone_number, but it's missing the phone number.\n\nTherefore, I need to ask the user for Fredrik's phone number before I can send the message.

But they don't know his phone number.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to send a message to him. The available functions include sending a message with a phone number, but the user doesn't have the number. So, maybe I should check if there's another way to find his contact info.\n\nLooking at the tools, there's a search_messages function. Maybe they can search for existing messages from Fredrik to get his phone number. But the user hasn't provided any message details. The search_messages function requires parameters like sender_phone_number, message_id, etc. Without any info, it's hard to search.\n\nWait, the user might have previous messages from Fredrik. If they use search_messages with sender's name or part of the content, but the function parameters don't include sender name. The sender_person_id or sender_phone_number are required for exact match. Since the user doesn't know the phone number, maybe they can't search effectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to know Fredrik's phone number, but as an AI, I don't have access to personal contact info. So the correct step is to inform them that without the phone number, I can't send the message. But the user already said they don't know the number.\n\nWait, the tools don't have a function to look up contact info by name. The search_messages might help if there are existing messages. Let me check the parameters again. The search_messages has sender_person_id, sender_phone_number, etc. If the user has previously messaged Fredrik, maybe searching by name in content? But content is fuzzy matched. If the user sent a message to Fredrik before, maybe the recipient_phone_number is stored. But the user is the sender here.\n\nWait, the user wants to send a message to Fredrik, so they need his phone number. If they don't have it, they can't send it. The system can't retrieve it without existing data. Since the user doesn't have the number and there's no function to look up contacts by name, the only option is to tell them they need the phone number.\n\nBut maybe check if there's another function. The get_current_location or others don't seem relevant. So the answer should be that without the phone number, I can't send the message. But the user already said they don't know it, so I should state that clearly.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to personal contact information like Fredrik Thordendal's phone number. To send a message, you'll need to provide the recipient's phone number. Would you like to try searching your message history for his contact information? (Note: This would require knowing at least part of his name/number or having previously exchanged messages with him)",

They tried searching their message history using the full name \"Fredrik Thordendal\" but found nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are other ways to find the contact info. The user mentioned they don't know his phone number and the search came up empty. Maybe they can try a different search term, like just \"Fredrik\" or \"Thordendal\" separately. But the user already tried the full name and maybe variations, but the response says they tried with the full name and found nothing.\n\nWait, the user's last message says they tried searching with his full name but found nothing. So the search_messages function was called with \"Fredrik Thordendal\" and returned an empty list. Now, without the phone number or any previous messages, the system can't proceed to send the message.\n\nThe available functions include send_message_with_phone_number, which requires the phone number and content. Since the phone number isn't available, the user can't use that function. The other option was to search messages, but that didn't work.\n\nPossible next steps: The user needs to provide the phone number directly. Since they don't have it, maybe suggest alternative methods like checking other contacts, social media, or official sources. But as an assistant, I can't access external data. So the only thing left is to inform the user that without the phone number, sending the message isn't possible and maybe ask if they have another way to get the number.\n\nWait, the user's last message says they can't proceed without the phone number or previous message info. So the assistant should confirm that and maybe offer to help with other tasks if needed. But the user's original request was to send a message to Fredrik. Since the necessary info is missing, the assistant should state that it's not possible and perhaps suggest alternatives if any.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's no function to look up phone numbers by name externally. The search_messages only checks existing messages. So without prior messages, there's no way to get the number through the tools given.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to inform the user that without the phone number, the message can't be sent, and maybe ask if they want to try something else.\n</think>\n\nWithout access to Fredrik Thordendal's phone number or any prior message history with him, I cannot send the message. Since we've confirmed there are no existing messages to reference, your options are:\n\n1. **Manually obtain his phone number** through official channels (e.g., band website, social media)\n2. **Try an alternative search** (e.g., just \"Fredrik\" or \"Meshuggah\" if he's associated with the band)\n3. **Cancel the request** if you're unable to locate the number\n\nWould you like to attempt any of these options, or is there another task I can assist with?",
