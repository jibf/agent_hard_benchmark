                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions to use. The main task is adding a reminder, so the add_reminder function is probably needed. But to set the reminder timestamp correctly, I need to convert \"tomorrow 5PM\" into a POSIX timestamp. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"tomorrow 5PM\". So I need to calculate the exact date and time. But I don't know the current date. Oh, right, there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give the current time. So first, I should call get_current_timestamp to know the current time, then figure out tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another function. There's datetime_info_to_timestamp which requires year, month, day, hour, etc. But to use that, I need to know the specific date for tomorrow. So first, get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to find today's date, then add one day for tomorrow, set the time to 17:00 (5 PM), then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date by adding 1 day to the current day. Need to handle month/year rollover, but maybe the function handles that? Wait, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function just takes the numbers, so I have to compute the correct date manually. But since the assistant can't do date math, maybe the system expects using the current timestamp and adding 24 hours? Wait, but \"tomorrow 5PM\" is not necessarily 24 hours from now if current time is after 5 PM today. Wait, no—if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours later. Hmm, but the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but to calculate that, I need to know today's date. So first, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, then set day to day +1, hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. But need to handle if day+1 exceeds the days in the month, etc. But since the assistant can't compute that, maybe the system expects using the current timestamp and adding 24 hours? But that's not accurate if the current time is after 5 PM. For example, if today is Monday 6 PM, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours later, not 24.\n\nWait, the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is a specific time, so it's the next day at 5 PM, regardless of current time. So if today is Monday, 10 AM, tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM. If today is Monday 6 PM, tomorrow 5 PM is still Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later.\n\nBut to get the correct timestamp, I need to know the exact date of tomorrow. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Increment the day by 1. If day exceeds the number of days in the month, adjust month and year accordingly. But since the assistant can't do that, maybe the system expects using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the next day's date. However, without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the current timestamp, add 24 hours, but set the time to 5 PM. Wait, no. Because if current time is 3 PM, adding 24 hours would get to 3 PM next day, but user wants 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM by taking the current date, adding one day, and setting the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform date calculations, the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info, then compute tomorrow's date and time, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, set the day to day +1. If day exceeds the days in the month, adjust month and year. But since the assistant can't do that, maybe the system expects that the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can handle it? Wait, no. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function just takes the numbers, so if you pass day=32 for a month with 31 days, it might not handle it correctly. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the current timestamp, add 24 hours, but then set the hour to 17. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the current timestamp, find the date part, add one day, set time to 17:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nBut without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nOnce we have the current timestamp, we can convert it to datetime info to get today's date, then compute tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user also mentioned the location: Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So we need the latitude and longitude for that location to include in the reminder.\n\nSo another step: search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get its latitude and longitude.\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon can be used, but it requires a location string. The parameters are location (required), and optionally latitude and longitude. Since we don't have the current location, but the user is asking for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, probably in a specific city. But without knowing the city, maybe the search will still work if the location string is specific enough.\n\nSo, need to call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nAssuming that returns the correct latitude and longitude for that store.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (to calculate tomorrow 5 PM)\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM (17:00)\n4. Convert that to POSIX timestamp\n5. Search for location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get lat/lon\n6. Add reminder with content, timestamp, and lat/lon\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations, each step needs to be done via function calls.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the result to get current date/time.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day+1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut need to handle if day+1 is beyond the month's days. However, the assistant can't do that, so perhaps the system expects that the datetime_info_to_timestamp function handles it, but according to the function description, it just takes the numbers. So if the day is invalid, it might not work. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to add 24 hours to the current timestamp and then adjust the time to 5 PM. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds), then set the time part to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to do that without knowing the current time? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then convert to datetime info, then compute the target datetime as tomorrow 5 PM, then convert back.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, tool call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n\nThen, tool call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=current_year, month=current_month, day=current_day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nBut if current_day +1 is beyond the month's days, this would be invalid. However, the assistant can't handle that, so perhaps the system expects that the user's \"tomorrow\" is correctly calculated by the datetime functions. Maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function is designed to handle overflow, like if day=32 in a 31-day month, it rolls over to next month. But the function description doesn't specify that, so it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to add 24 hours to the current timestamp, but then set the hour to 17. However, that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe the user's \"tomorrow 5PM\" is exactly 24 hours from now if current time is before 5 PM today, but if current time is after 5 PM, then it's 24 hours plus the difference. But no, \"tomorrow 5PM\" is always the next day at 5 PM, regardless of current time.\n\nFor example, if it's Monday 6 PM, tomorrow 5 PM is Tuesday 5 PM, which is 23 hours later.\n\nSo the correct way is to take today's date, add one day, set time to 17:00.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get today's date.\n3. Set day = day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo first, call get_current",
