                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current time isn't provided, maybe I should get the current timestamp first. Wait, there's a function called get_current_timestamp. But maybe I can calculate it if I assume the current date, but the user didn't specify. Hmm, but the problem says not to make assumptions. So I should probably use get_current_timestamp to find the current time, then calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". So I need to convert that into a POSIX timestamp. To do that accurately, I need to know the current date to determine what \"tomorrow\" is. So first, I should call get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then add 24 hours (or 86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's date. But wait, maybe the user is in a timezone where daylight saving changes, but since the functions don't mention timezone, maybe it's all in UTC? Or maybe the system handles local time. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but the functions like datetime_info_to_timestamp probably expect the parameters in the user's local time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp by figuring out the date for tomorrow. But to do that, I need to know today's date. So first, call get_current_timestamp, then convert that to datetime info to find today's year, month, day, then add one day for tomorrow, set hour to 17 (5 PM), minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nWait, the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if today is, say, October 5th, then tomorrow is October 6th at 17:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to know today's date.\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day, handle month/year rollover if needed).\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert that datetime to POSIX timestamp.\n6. Then, find the latitude and longitude of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to set the location for the reminder.\n\nWait, the reminder can have latitude and longitude. The user mentioned \"at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", so I need to get the coordinates of that location.\n\nSo first, search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" using search_location_around_lat_lon. But since we don't have current latitude/longitude, maybe the function defaults to current location, but the user didn't provide that. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires \"location\" as a parameter, and latitude/longitude are optional. If not provided, it defaults to current location. But since we don't have current location, maybe we can't get the exact coordinates. Wait, but the user is specifying the location as \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", so perhaps we can search for that location string.\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon takes a \"location\" parameter which is a surface form query. So we can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", and since latitude and longitude are not provided, it will search around the current location. But without current location, maybe it's still possible to get the address. However, there might be multiple Whole Foods on Stevens Creek (maybe in different cities), but the user probably means a specific one. However, the function might return the correct one based on context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use search_lat_lon if we had coordinates, but we don't. So first step is to find the coordinates of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n1. Use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the address and coordinates.\n2. From the search result, extract latitude and longitude.\n3. Calculate the reminder timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut to calculate the timestamp, need to know tomorrow's date. So:\n\na. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\nb. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\nc. Add one day to get tomorrow's date.\nd. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with tomorrow's date at 17:00:00 to get the POSIX timestamp.\n\nWait, but adding one day isn't as simple as adding 86400 seconds because of daylight saving time. However, the functions might handle that, but since we're using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, which takes year, month, day, hour, etc., we can calculate tomorrow's date correctly by incrementing the day and adjusting month/year if necessary.\n\nBut how to do that without knowing the current date? So first, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, then compute tomorrow.\n\nSo steps in order:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (day +1, handle month/year changes).\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with tomorrow's date at 17:00:00 to get the reminder timestamp.\n5. Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get coordinates.\n6. Use add_reminder with content, timestamp, and coordinates.\n\nBut the problem is that the assistant needs to make multiple function calls. However, each turn the assistant can make multiple tool calls. Wait, the user message is a single request, so the assistant should generate the necessary tool calls step by step.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo the assistant should output the tool calls needed, in order.\n\nFirst, to get the current timestamp, because we need to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, once we have current timestamp, convert it to datetime info to find tomorrow.\n\nBut since the assistant can't process the response, it has to plan the sequence.\n\nWait, but in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls needed to fulfill the user's request, without seeing the responses. So it has to anticipate the necessary steps.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to know today's date.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to extract year, month, day.\n3. Compute tomorrow's date (day +1, handle month/year).\n4. Convert tomorrow 5 PM to timestamp.\n5. Search for Whole Foods location to get coordinates.\n6. Add reminder with content, timestamp, and coordinates.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do calculations, it has to call the functions in sequence.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on the result to get current date components.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with tomorrow's date and 17:00.\n\nBut the assistant has to generate the tool calls in the correct order, assuming that each step depends on the previous.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, the assistant is to output the necessary tool calls for the current step. Since the user hasn't provided any prior context, the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user's request is to set a reminder for tomorrow 5 PM. To compute that timestamp, we need to know the current date. So the first tool call should be get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, once we have that, convert it to datetime info to find tomorrow.\n\nBut since the assistant can't process the response, it has to generate the next tool call based on the previous.\n\nBut in this scenario, the assistant is supposed to output all necessary tool calls in one go? Or step by step?\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo for the user's query, the assistant needs to determine which functions to call, and output each tool_call.\n\nBut since some functions depend on the output of others, the assistant has to sequence them.\n\nHowever, in this case, the assistant can't know the current timestamp without calling get_current_timestamp first. So the first tool call is get_current_timestamp.\n\nAfter that, we need to convert that timestamp to datetime info, so call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the timestamp obtained.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date, then call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date and time.\n\nAdditionally, search for the location to get coordinates.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info (with the result of 1)\n3. datetime_info_to_timestamp (with tomorrow's date at 17:00)\n4. search_location_around_lat_lon for \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\"\n5. add_reminder with the timestamp from step 3 and coordinates from step 4.\n\nBut since the assistant can't execute these steps, it has to generate the tool calls in order, assuming that each subsequent call uses the result of the previous.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, the assistant is to output the tool calls needed for the current step. Since the user hasn't provided any prior information, the first necessary step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a function that can directly compute tomorrow's date without getting current timestamp first? No, because \"tomorrow\" is relative to now.\n\nTherefore, the first tool call must be get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, based on that, convert to datetime info.\n\nBut the assistant has to output the tool calls one after another. However, in the response, the assistant can output multiple tool_call blocks in",
