                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out which functions to use here.\n\nSo, the main task is modifying a reminder's time. But to do that, I need to know the reminder ID. The user didn't specify which reminder, so maybe I need to search for it first. The user says \"upcoming reminder,\" which probably means the next one that's scheduled. \n\nI should start by using the search_reminder function. But what parameters do I need? Since it's \"upcoming,\" maybe look for reminders where the reminder_timestamp is after the current time. But the search function requires specific criteria. Wait, the search_reminder allows using lower and upper bounds for timestamps. \n\nFirst, I need the current timestamp to know what \"upcoming\" means. So I should call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, maybe search for reminders with reminder_timestamp greater than the current timestamp. But the search function's parameters include reminder_timestamp_lowerbound. So set that to the current timestamp. But the user says \"upcoming,\" which might be the next one, so maybe the earliest one after now.\n\nWait, but the search_reminder function returns all matching entries. So if I set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to current timestamp, it will get all future reminders. Then, among those, the \"upcoming\" one is probably the one with the smallest reminder_timestamp. But the function doesn't sort them, so I might need to get all and pick the first one. However, the assistant can't process that; it has to rely on the tool responses.\n\nBut the problem is, the user didn't specify which reminder, so the assistant needs to find the correct reminder ID first. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Use search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current timestamp to find all upcoming reminders.\n3. From the results, identify the \"upcoming\" one (maybe the next one, i.e., the one with the earliest reminder_timestamp).\n4. Once the reminder ID is known, modify it to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut the user says \"push my upcoming reminder to tomorrow 5PM\". So \"tomorrow\" is relative to today. So need to calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a timestamp.\n\nWait, but first, need to find the reminder. Let's start with step 1: get current timestamp.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, with that timestamp, search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is after current time. So search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current_timestamp.\n\nAssuming that returns a list, the first one (or the only one) is the upcoming reminder. Then, take its reminder_id.\n\nThen, need to set the new reminder_timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM. To get that timestamp, need to calculate tomorrow's date at 17:00 (5 PM in 24h).\n\nHow to calculate that? Well, current timestamp is known. Maybe use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but need to set the time to 17:00. Alternatively, get current datetime info, adjust the date to tomorrow, set time to 17:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is in POSIX. Let's say current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:00. Tomorrow at 5 PM is 2023-10-06 17:00:00. So need to compute that timestamp.\n\nPossible approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get today's date.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date: add 1 day to current date.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert that datetime to POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp to add 1 day, but then adjust the time to 17:00. But shifting by 1 day might not account for the time part. For example, if current time is 14:30, adding 1 day would be 14:30 tomorrow. But we need 17:00, so need to adjust.\n\nSo better to:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n- Tomorrow is current day +1, handling month/year rollover.\n- Then create a new datetime for tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\nAfter getting current timestamp, call timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date components.\n\nThen, increment day by 1, handle if day exceeds month days, etc. But the tool might handle that when converting back.\n\nWait, but the assistant can't do date math itself. So need to use the tools.\n\nAlternative: use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to current timestamp, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp shifts the entire timestamp. For example, if current time is 10:00 today, adding 1 day would make it 10:00 tomorrow. But we need 17:00 tomorrow. So need to adjust the time.\n\nHmm. Maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by 1 day to get T+1d.\n- Convert T+1d to datetime info, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to set the hour, etc. So:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp → T.\n\nCall shift_timestamp with T, days=1 → T_tomorrow.\n\nCall timestamp_to_datetime_info on T_tomorrow to get year, month, day.\n\nThen, create a new datetime with those year, month, day, but hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nCall datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day might not be accurate if the current time is, say, 23:00 and adding 1 day would be next day 23:00, but we need 17:00. So better to compute tomorrow's date regardless of current time.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse get_current_timestamp to get T.\n\nConvert T to datetime info (year, month, day, ...).\n\nTomorrow's date is day +1, but need to handle end of month.\n\nBut the assistant can't compute that, so need to use tools.\n\nWait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives current date. Then, to get tomorrow's date, perhaps shift the timestamp by 1 day, then get the date part.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\n- Get current T.\n- Shift T by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=1) → T_tomorrow.\n- Convert T_tomorrow to datetime info → gives tomorrow's date.\n- Then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems feasible.\n\nSo steps for the timestamp:\n\n1. get_current → T.\n2. shift_timestamp(T, days=1) → T_tomorrow.\n3. timestamp_to_datetime_info(T_tomorrow) → gives year, month, day of tomorrow.\n4. datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nWait but step 3 gives the datetime of T_tomorrow, which is current time + 1 day. So if current time is 14:30, T_tomorrow is 14:30 tomorrow. But we need 17:00 tomorrow. So the hour from step 3 is 14, which we need to change to 17.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter step 3, take the year, month, day from T_tomorrow's datetime, but set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen convert that to timestamp.\n\nYes. So:\n\n- Get T_current via get_current.\n- Shift T_current by 1 day to get T_tomorrow (but this is same time tomorrow).\n- Convert T_tomorrow to datetime info to get tomorrow's date (year, month, day).\n- Create a new datetime with that date, hour=17, 0, 0.\n- Convert to timestamp.\n\nSo that's the new reminder_timestamp.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, find the upcoming reminder:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Search reminders with reminder_timestamp > current timestamp (lowerbound = current timestamp).\n- Assuming the first result is the \"upcoming\" one, take its reminder_id.\n\nThen, calculate tomorrow 5 PM timestamp as above.\n\nModify the reminder with new reminder_timestamp.\n\nBut the user didn't specify which reminder, so need to search first.\n\nSo tool calls needed:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp (to get current time for search)\n2. search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current_timestamp\n3. From search results, get reminder_id (assuming the first one is the upcoming)\n4. Calculate tomorrow 5 PM timestamp:\n   a. shift current_timestamp by 1 day\n   b. convert to datetime info to get tomorrow's date\n   c. set hour=17, etc., and convert to timestamp\n5. modify_reminder with new timestamp\n\nBut since the assistant can't process the search results, it has to make tool calls step by step.\n\nFirst, need to get current timestamp to perform the search.\n\nSo first tool call: get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use that timestamp to search for reminders with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound.\n\nThen, assuming the search returns at least one reminder, take the first one",
