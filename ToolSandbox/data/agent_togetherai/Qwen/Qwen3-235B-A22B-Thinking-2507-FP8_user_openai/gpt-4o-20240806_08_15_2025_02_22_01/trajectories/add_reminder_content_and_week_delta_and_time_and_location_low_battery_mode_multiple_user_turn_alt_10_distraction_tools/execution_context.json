                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the details required for the add_reminder function. The function requires content and reminder_timestamp. The content here is \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\". But the timestamp is missing. The user didn't specify when they want the reminder. So I need to ask for clarification on the time.\n\nWait, maybe they expect the reminder to be set for a specific time, but since it's not mentioned, I can't assume. The function requires a POSIX timestamp, so without a specific time, I can't proceed. I should prompt the user to provide the date and time for the reminder.\n\nAlso, the location part: Whole Foods is a store, so maybe the user wants the reminder triggered when they're near Whole Foods. But the add_reminder function allows latitude and longitude as optional parameters. However, to get the location's coordinates, I might need to use search_location_around_lat_lon or search_lat_lon. But first, I need the current location or the specific coordinates of Whole Foods.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify the time, so the main issue is the timestamp. Let me check the function parameters again. The add_reminder requires content and reminder_timestamp. Since the user didn't mention when, I need to ask them for the time. Maybe they want it immediately, but that's not typical for a reminder. Probably, they have a specific time in mind, like after work or tomorrow morning.\n\nSo the next step is to request the user to specify the date and time for the reminder. Without that, I can't fill in the reminder_timestamp parameter. Also, if they want location-based reminder, I need the coordinates of Whole Foods, but first, the time is critical.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to ask for the time when they want to be reminded.\n</think>\n\nTo set your reminder, I need to know the specific date and time you'd like to be reminded. Could you please provide when you want the reminder for \"buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods\"? (e.g., \"tomorrow at 6pm\", \"next Monday at 9am\")",

The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to convert \"tomorrow at 5PM\" into a POSIX timestamp. But to do that, I need the current timestamp to figure out what tomorrow is. So I should call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can calculate tomorrow's date. Since the user said tomorrow, I need to add one day to the current date. But wait, maybe using the shift_timestamp function would be better here. The shift_timestamp function allows adding days, hours, etc. So if I get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day and set the time to 5 PM.\n\nWait, but the user specified 5 PM tomorrow. So if today is, say, October 10th at 3 PM, tomorrow at 5 PM would be October 11th at 5 PM. So I need to take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day, then adjust the hour to 17 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24-hour format).\n\nBut how to handle the exact time? Maybe first get the current timestamp, then use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but also set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0. Wait, but shift_timestamp only shifts by deltas, not set specific times. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, etc. So if I get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then add one day to the day, set hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, the tools available include get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and datetime_info_to_timestamp. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current date and time components. Then, add one day to the day, making sure to handle month and year rollovers. Then, set the hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0. Then convert that back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. The user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\". Assuming that \"tomorrow\" is exactly 24 hours from now, but if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow at 5 PM would be 23 hours from now. Wait, no. If current time is 6 PM, tomorrow at 5 PM is 23 hours later. But the user probably means the next occurrence of 5 PM, which would be 23 hours if current time is after 5 PM today. Wait, but the user said \"tomorrow\", so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5 PM.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day, then set the time to 5 PM. But how to set the time? The shift_timestamp can shift days, but not set the exact time. So perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Add 1 to the day.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to add days directly to datetime info. Wait, the shift_timestamp function can shift by days. So if I take the current timestamp, and shift it by 1 day, but also adjust the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, which would make it the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time.\n\nWait, for example, if it's 3 PM today, shifting by 1 day would get to 3 PM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, so we need to shift by 1 day and 2 hours. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's \"tomorrow at 5PM\" is intended as the next 5 PM after the current time. So if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow at 5 PM is 23 hours from now. But the user says \"tomorrow\", so it's the next day's 5 PM.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- If current hour is after 17 (5 PM), then tomorrow's 5 PM is (current date + 1 day) at 17:00.\n- If current hour is before 17, then tomorrow's 5 PM is (current date) at 17:00? No, wait. Wait, \"tomorrow\" means the next day. So regardless of current time, tomorrow at 5 PM is the next day's 5 PM.\n\nWait, no. If today is Monday, and it's 6 PM, then \"tomorrow at 5 PM\" would be Tuesday at 5 PM, which is 23 hours from now.\n\nSo the correct way is to take the current date, add one day, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Add 1 to the day, handling month/year changes if necessary.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp (datetime_info_to_timestamp).\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to add days to datetime info. Wait, the shift_timestamp function can shift by days. So perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=1).\n- Then, adjust the time to 5 PM. But how?\n\nWait, shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, so if current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day gives 3 PM tomorrow. But we need 5 PM tomorrow, so we need to shift by 1 day and 2 hours. Wait, no. If current time is 3 PM, then tomorrow at 5 PM is 26 hours from now (24 + 2). But that's not correct. Wait, 3 PM today to 3 PM tomorrow is 24 hours. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, it's 26 hours from 3 PM today. But the user said \"tomorrow at 5 PM\", which is 24 hours plus 2 hours, so 26 hours from now if current time is 3 PM.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to set the time to 5 PM of the next day. So regardless of current time, set the date to tomorrow's date at 5 PM.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_datetime = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_timestamp)\n\ntomorrow_datetime = {\n  year: current_datetime.year,\n  month: current_datetime.month,\n  day: current_datetime.day + 1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut need to handle if day exceeds month days, etc. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function probably handles that. So:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get components.\n- Increment day by 1.\n- Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nBut the user might have meant \"tomorrow\" as in the next occurrence of 5 PM, which could be today if it's before 5 PM. Wait, no. The user said \"tomorrow at 5PM\", so it's specifically tomorrow.\n\nWait, if today is Monday and it's 4 PM, then \"tomorrow at 5 PM\" is Tuesday 5 PM. If it's 6 PM Monday, \"tomorrow at 5 PM\" is still Tuesday 5 PM.\n\nSo regardless of current time, it's the next day at 5 PM.\n\nTherefore, the correct timestamp is (current date + 1 day) at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Add 1 to day.\n4. Set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to add 1 to the day. However, the shift_timestamp function can shift by days. Wait, shift_timestamp takes a timestamp and shifts it by deltas. So if I take the current timestamp and shift it by 1 day, that gives me the same time tomorrow. But we need 5 PM tomorrow, so if current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day gives 3 PM tomorrow, then we need to add 2 hours. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set the time to 5 PM today, and if that's in the past, add 1 day.\n\nBut the user specified \"tomorrow\", so it's definitely the next day.\n\nHmm, maybe the best approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Use shift_timestamp to add 1 day (days=1).\n- Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the shifted timestamp's components.\n- Then, set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Then, convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day would give the same time tomorrow. So if current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day is 3 PM tomorrow. Then, changing the hour to ",

                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to add a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on McKinley Ave. They mentioned making sure it's the right location.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current timestamp to calculate tomorrow's date. So I'll call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, convert that timestamp to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info to adjust the date and time.\n\nWait, but the user specified tomorrow at 5 PM. So I need to set the reminder for the next day at 17:00. Let me think. If today is, say, October 10th, then tomorrow is October 11th. So I need to take the current date, add one day, set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0.\n\nBut how to handle the date adjustment. Maybe use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but also set the time to 5 PM. Wait, shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc. So if I take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day and then adjust the hour to 17. But shift_timestamp only shifts by deltas, not set absolute time.\n\nAlternatively, get the current timestamp, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp with year, month, day+1, hour=17, etc. But to do that, I need the current date components.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Add 1 to the day (handling month/year rollover, but maybe the function does that automatically).\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow\", so adding 1 day to current day. However, if the current day is the last day of the month, adding 1 would roll over to next month. But the timestamp functions should handle that.\n\nBut the user also specified the location: Whole Foods on McKinley Ave. So I need to get the latitude and longitude for that address to include in the reminder.\n\nSo first, I need to search for the location \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\" to get its coordinates. Wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires a location string, but if latitude and longitude aren't provided, it uses current location. But the user wants the specific address.\n\nWait, there's a function called search_lat_lon which takes latitude and longitude to get the address, but that's the reverse. Wait, no. Wait, the user provided the address, so I need to geocode \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\" to get its lat/lon.\n\nWait, looking at the tools, there's search_location_around_lat_lon which can search for a location string. The parameters are location (required), and optional lat/lon. But if lat/lon aren't provided, it defaults to current location. However, the user wants to find the specific address, so maybe we need to use that function with the location string \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\" and without lat/lon, but that might not be precise.\n\nWait, but the function search_location_around_lat_lon is for searching around a lat/lon, but if lat/lon aren't provided, it uses current location. However, the user is specifying the exact address, so perhaps we should first get the current location to use as a reference? Or maybe the function can search globally for the location string.\n\nWait, the description says: \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nSo if we don't provide lat/lon, it searches around current location. But the user is asking for a specific address (Whole Foods on McKinley Ave), which might be in a different city. So perhaps we need to first get the current location to use as a reference, but that might not help if the address is elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can still search for the exact address even without lat/lon, but it's not clear. The problem is that without knowing the city/state, \"McKinley Ave\" could be in multiple places.\n\nWait, the user said \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\". Maybe it's in their current city, so if we get the current location first, then search around there.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current location (get_current_location) to have lat/lon.\n2. Use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\", and the current lat/lon to find the specific store.\n\nBut the user might not be in the same city as McKinley Ave, but perhaps the current location is nearby.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that \"McKinley Ave\" is in their current area, so using current location as the center for the search.\n\nSo first, call get_current_location to get lat and lon.\n\nThen, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods\" and maybe \"McKinley Ave\" as part of the query. Wait, the location parameter is a string, so it can be \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\".\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon takes a location string, which can be a full address. So passing \"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\" as the location parameter.\n\nBut to get precise results, it's better to have the lat/lon of the current location to narrow down the search. So first get current location, then use that lat/lon in the search.\n\nSo:\n\n- Call get_current_location to get current lat/lon.\n- Then call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\", and the current lat/lon.\n\nBut the function parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon require location (string), and optional lat/lon. So if we provide the current lat/lon from get_current_location, the search will be around there.\n\nOnce we get the search results, pick the correct Whole Foods location (assuming there's one on McKinley Ave in the area), and extract its lat/lon.\n\nThen, use those coordinates for the reminder.\n\nBut the user might have multiple Whole Foods, so we need to ensure it's the correct one. However, the user specified \"on McKinley Ave\", so the search should return that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to calculate tomorrow 5 PM.\n2. Convert to timestamp for reminder.\n3. Get current location to search for Whole Foods on McKinley Ave.\n4. Use the found lat/lon for the reminder.\n\nBut the user's latest message says they want to include the location as Whole Foods on McKinley Ave, so we need to geocode that address.\n\nWait, but the tools don't have a direct geocoding function. The search_location_around_lat_lon can be used to find locations, which may return lat/lon.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_location to get current lat/lon (maybe not necessary, but to center the search).\n- Call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Whole Foods on McKinley Ave\", using current lat/lon if available.\n- From the results, get the lat/lon of the correct store.\n- Then, create the reminder with that lat/lon.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the city, so the search might be ambiguous. However, assuming that McKinley Ave is in the current city, using current location as the center.\n\nSo first, get current location.\n\nThen, search for the location.\n\nOnce we have the coordinates, we can set the reminder with content, timestamp, and lat/lon.\n\nAlso, need to calculate the reminder timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, shift it to tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nWait, let's outline all the function calls needed:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp: to know current time.\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info: to get current date components.\n3. Adjust date to tomorrow, set time to 17:00:00.\n4. datetime_info_to_timestamp: convert back to timestamp.\nBut maybe using shift_timestamp is easier. Wait, if current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day and 2 hours would get to 5 PM tomorrow. But how to calculate the exact shift.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, then use shift_timestamp with days=1, hours= (17 - current_hour). But current_hour varies.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = day +1, hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nThen create new datetime info with day+1, hour=17, etc.\n\nThen datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if day+1 exceeds the month's days, but the function should handle that.\n\nSo function calls:\n\n1. get_current_timestamp\n2. timestamp_to_datetime_info (with the current timestamp)\n3. datetime_info_to_timestamp (with modified date)\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow\", so adding 1 day to current date, regardless of time.\n\nWait, but if it's 6 PM today, tomorrow at 5 PM is 23 hours from now, not 24. So adding 1 day would be 6 PM tomorrow, which is later than 5 PM. So need to adjust.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct way is:\n\nThe reminder is for 5 PM tomorrow, which is:\n\ncurrent_date + 1 day, at ",

The user wants to set a reminder for tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on McKinley Ave.\n\nFirst, I tried to get the current timestamp and location. The timestamp was retrieved successfully, but the location service was disabled, giving a PermissionError.\n\nThen, I converted the timestamp to datetime info, which showed August 15, 2025, at 7:45 AM. Since the user wants tomorrow at 5 PM, I adjusted the date to August 16 and set the time to 17:00, converting it back to a timestamp (1755378000.0), which is correct for August 16, 2025, 5 PM.\n\nNext, I tried to search for the Whole Foods location using search_location_around_lat_lon, but since location services were off, it failed again. Then, I attempted to enable location services with set_location_service_status, but got another error saying it can't be turned on in low battery mode.\n\nChecked the low battery mode status and it's True. So the issue is that low battery mode is preventing location services from being enabled.\n\nThe user needs location services on to get the coordinates for the reminder. But since low battery mode is active, I can't turn on location services. Maybe the user needs to disable low battery mode first. However, the available tools include set_low_battery_mode_status. So I should offer to turn off low battery mode to enable location services.\n\nBut the user's main request is to set the reminder. Without location services, I can't get the coordinates for Whole Foods. So the next step is to ask the user if they want to disable low battery mode to proceed, or maybe set the reminder without the location coordinates. But the user specifically mentioned ensuring it's the correct location, so coordinates are important.\n\nWait, the user might not know about the low battery mode conflict. I should explain the issue and ask for permission to disable low battery mode. If they agree, call set_low_battery_mode_status with on=False, then proceed to get location and set the reminder.\n</think>\n\nTo proceed with setting your reminder at the correct Whole Foods location, I need to enable location services. However, your device is currently in **low battery mode**, which prevents location services from being activated.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Disable low battery mode** to enable location services (this may increase battery usage), or  \n2. Set the reminder **without location coordinates** (less precise, but functional)?\n\nPlease confirm your preference.",
