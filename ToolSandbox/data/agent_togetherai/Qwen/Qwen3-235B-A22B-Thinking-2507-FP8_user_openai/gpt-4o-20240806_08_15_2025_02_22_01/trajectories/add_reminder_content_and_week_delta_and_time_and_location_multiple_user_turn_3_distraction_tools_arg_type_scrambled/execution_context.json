                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. First, I need to figure out what functions to use here.\n\nThey mentioned \"remind me,\" so probably the add_reminder function. But to set a reminder with a location, I need the latitude and longitude for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. Wait, the user didn't provide coordinates. So maybe I should first search for the location using search_location_around_lat_lon. But wait, the function requires a location string. The user said \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek,\" which is the location query. However, the function also needs latitude and longitude unless it defaults to current location. But the user didn't specify their current location. Hmm, maybe I need to get the coordinates for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek first.\n\nWait, there's another function called search_lat_lon, but that's for getting an address from lat/lon. No, the user is providing a location name, so I should use search_location_around_lat_lon with location set to \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" But the parameters for that function require \"location\" as a required field, and latitude and longitude are optional. Since the user didn't give coordinates, maybe the function will handle it by searching based on the location string alone. Wait, the description says when lat/lon aren't provided, it defaults to current location. But we don't have the current location here. Maybe the function can still search for the location string without lat/lon? The description says \"location is a surface form query,\" so maybe it's okay to just pass the location string and leave lat/lon out. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe search_location_around_lat_lon function has required parameter \"location\", and lat/lon are optional. So I can call it with just the location. So first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the address and coordinates. Then, once I have the lat/lon from that search, I can use add_reminder with the content, the reminder timestamp (which I need to figure out), and the lat/lon.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify a time for the reminder. They just said \"remind me to buy chocolate milk...\" So maybe the reminder is location-based, triggered when they arrive at Whole Foods. But the add_reminder function requires a reminder_timestamp as a POSIX timestamp. However, if it's a location-based reminder, maybe the timestamp isn't needed, but according to the function definition, reminder_timestamp is required. Wait, looking at add_reminder parameters: required are content and reminder_timestamp. So even if it's location-based, we still need a timestamp. But the user didn't specify a time. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the reminder is supposed to trigger when arriving at the location, but the function requires a timestamp. Maybe the system uses the timestamp as a deadline, but the user didn't specify when. So perhaps the user expects a reminder when they are near the location, but the function needs a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is optional in practice, but according to the function definition, it's required. Wait, no: the required fields for add_reminder are content and reminder_timestamp. So we must have a timestamp. But the user didn't provide a time. So maybe the assistant should ask for clarification on when to set the reminder. However, the user instruction says not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user's message is: \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" There's no time mentioned. So the assistant should probably ask when the user wants to be reminded. But the problem is, the user might expect the reminder to trigger when arriving at the location, which is a geofenced reminder. However, the add_reminder function requires a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is used as an expiration or something else, but the function's description says \"When the user wants to be reminded. Expressed in POSIX timestamp.\" So it's a time-based reminder, not location-based. Wait, but the function also has latitude and longitude as optional parameters. So perhaps the reminder triggers when the user is at that location and the time is past the timestamp? Or maybe the timestamp is the time when the reminder should be triggered, and the location is additional info.\n\nBut the user didn't specify a time. So this is ambiguous. The correct action is to ask for clarification: when should the reminder be set? However, the user might have intended it to be a location-based reminder without a specific time, but the function requires a timestamp. So perhaps the assistant needs to get the current timestamp as a default, but that's making an assumption. Wait, the instructions say not to make assumptions about values to plug into functions. So if the user didn't specify a time, we can't just pick one. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user to specify the time for the reminder.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user expects the reminder to trigger when arriving at Whole Foods, so the timestamp isn't needed, but the function requires it. This is a conflict. Let me check the function description again for add_reminder: \"reminder_timestamp: When the user wants to be reminded. Expressed in POSIX timestamp\". So it's a required field. Therefore, without a timestamp, we can't call add_reminder. Hence, the assistant must ask the user when they want to be reminded.\n\nBut the user's original request is to be reminded at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. Maybe they mean when they arrive there, so the timestamp is not a specific time but location-based. However, the function requires a timestamp. This is a problem. Maybe the system uses the timestamp as a fallback, but the primary trigger is location. But according to the function definition, the timestamp is required. So perhaps the assistant needs to set a timestamp, but since the user didn't specify, it's ambiguous.\n\nGiven the instructions not to make assumptions, the correct step is to ask for clarification on the time. However, the user might not know that the system requires a timestamp. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the current timestamp and set the reminder for now, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the reminder is meant to be triggered when arriving, so the timestamp is set to a far future date, but that's an assumption.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the reminder's timestamp is the time when the user arrives at the location, but since we can't predict that, the system might handle it differently. However, the function requires a specific timestamp. Therefore, without a timestamp provided by the user, we can't proceed. So the assistant should respond by asking when the user wants to be reminded.\n\nBut the user's message is a command to set the reminder, so maybe the assistant should first find the location's coordinates, then ask for the time. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Use search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the coordinates.\n2. Once coordinates are obtained, ask the user for the reminder time.\n\nBut the user didn't provide time, so after getting the location, we need to prompt for time. However, the problem is that the assistant is supposed to call functions as needed. Wait, the user's instruction says \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" But if the query is ambiguous (missing time), the assistant should ask for clarification instead of calling functions.\n\nWait, the initial instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because it lacks a time for the reminder. The add_reminder function requires a reminder_timestamp. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user to specify when they want to be reminded.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way. Maybe the reminder is supposed to be location-based, and the timestamp is optional in practice, but according to the function definition, it's required. So no, the function requires it. Hence, ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should respond with a request for clarification on the time.\n</think>\n\nThe request to set a reminder is missing the specific time when you'd like to be reminded. Could you please specify when you want the reminder to trigger (e.g., \"tomorrow at 3pm\", \"next Monday\", etc.)? This is required to create the reminder.",

The user initially wanted to set a reminder to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek but forgot to specify the time. They later clarified it's tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I needed to get the current timestamp to figure out what \"tomorrow\" means. Using get_current_timestamp gave me the current time in POSIX format. Then, I converted that to datetime info to know the current date. The response showed it was August 15, 2025. So tomorrow would be August 16.\n\nNext, I converted August 16 at 5 PM (17:00) to a POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp. That gave me 1755378000.0. \n\nThen, I had to find the location of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. I used search_location_around_lat_lon with the location query. The result provided the latitude and longitude for the store.\n\nFinally, I added the reminder with the content, the calculated timestamp, and the coordinates from the location search. The response was a reminder ID, so the reminder was successfully created.\n\nI should confirm to the user that the reminder is set for tomorrow at 5 PM at the correct location. Make sure to mention the specific address and time to avoid any confusion.\n</think>\n\nYour reminder to **buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek** has been set for **tomorrow at 5:00 PM** at:  \n**Whole Foods Market**  \n20955 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA 95014  \n\n📍 *Reminder will trigger when you're near this location or at the specified time.*  \n✅ **Reminder ID:** `564a0de7-d111-4d96-bf3c-9d7408d3795c`  \n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust this! 😊",
