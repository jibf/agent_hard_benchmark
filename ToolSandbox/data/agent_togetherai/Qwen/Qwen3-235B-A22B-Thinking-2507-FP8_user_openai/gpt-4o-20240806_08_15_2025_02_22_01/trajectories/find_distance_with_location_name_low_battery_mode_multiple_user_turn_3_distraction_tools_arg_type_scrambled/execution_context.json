                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked where the Golden Gate Bridge is. I tried to use the search_location_around_lat_lon function, but got a PermissionError saying location services aren't enabled. Hmm, so the problem is that the app can't access the current location because location services are off.\n\nFirst, I need to check if location services are enabled. The user might not have them turned on. There's a function called get_location_service_status that can check this. Let me call that to confirm.\n\nWait, the error message says \"Location service is not enabled,\" so maybe it's already clear that it's off. But maybe the user needs to enable it. However, to proceed with the search, the app needs the current location. Since location services are off, the search can't default to current location. But the user is asking for a specific place, the Golden Gate Bridge, which has a known location. Maybe I don't need the current location here. Wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function requires a location parameter, which is the surface query (like \"Golden Gate Bridge\"), but if latitude and longitude aren't provided, it defaults to current location. However, since location services are off, it can't get the current lat/lon, hence the error.\n\nSo, the issue is that the function tried to use the current location (which isn't available) because latitude and longitude weren't provided. But the user is asking for the Golden Gate Bridge's location, which is a specific place. Maybe I should instead use search_lat_lon if I know the coordinates, but I don't. Alternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can still work if I provide the location name without needing current coordinates. Wait, the function's description says: \"When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\" But in this case, the user is searching for \"Golden Gate Bridge\", so maybe the function can find it without needing current location? But the error suggests that it tried to use current location and failed.\n\nWait, perhaps the function requires current location even when searching for a specific place, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the error is because location services are off, so even though we're searching for a specific location, the system is trying to get the current location to calculate something else. Or maybe the function is designed to search around the current location, but the user is asking for a specific place, so maybe the function isn't the right one.\n\nWait, the user is asking \"Where's the Golden Gate Bridge\", which is a specific landmark. The correct approach might be to use search_location_around_lat_lon with the location parameter as \"Golden Gate Bridge\", but without needing current coordinates. However, the function's parameters say that latitude and longitude are optional, defaulting to current. But if location services are off, it can't get current, hence the error.\n\nSo, the problem is that the function requires current location to default, but it's not available. To fix this, maybe we need to enable location services first. But the user might not want to do that. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon can still work if we provide the location name even without current coordinates. But according to the error, it's trying to access location services, which are off.\n\nSo, the next step is to check the location service status. Let me call get_location_service_status to confirm it's off. Then, if it's off, maybe prompt the user to enable it. But since the user is asking for a specific location, maybe we can bypass current location by providing lat/lon directly. However, I don't know the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge offhand. Alternatively, maybe use another function.\n\nWait, there's also the search_lat_lon function, but that requires latitude and longitude as inputs to get the address. But we don't have the coordinates for the Golden Gate Bridge. So that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon can still retrieve the location of the Golden Gate Bridge even without current coordinates. Maybe the error is because the system is trying to use current location for some reason, but the actual search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" doesn't need it. Maybe the error is a red herring, or perhaps the function is designed to require current location even when searching for a specific place, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the error message is \"PermissionError: Location service is not enabled.\" So the function tried to access location services, which are disabled. Therefore, to perform the search, the app needs location services enabled. So the correct step is to check if location services are enabled, and if not, ask the user to enable them.\n\nSo first, call get_location_service_status to check. If it's off, then maybe prompt the user to enable it. But since the user is asking for a specific location, maybe there's a way to proceed without current location. However, the function seems to require it.\n\nWait, looking back at the function definition for search_location_around_lat_lon: the parameters are location (required), latitude (optional, defaults to current), longitude (optional, defaults to current). So if latitude and longitude are not provided, it uses current. But in this case, the user is searching for \"Golden Gate Bridge\", which is a specific place, so maybe the function can find it regardless of current location. However, the error indicates that it tried to get current location and failed because services are off.\n\nTherefore, to resolve this, we need to either enable location services or provide latitude and longitude. Since we don't have the coordinates for the Golden Gate Bridge, enabling location services might not help unless the user is near it, which they might not be. Wait, no—the user is asking where the Golden Gate Bridge is, so they probably aren't there. So enabling location services to get their current location wouldn't help find the bridge's location.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the function is designed to search for locations near the current location, but the user is asking for a specific landmark. So perhaps the correct function to use here is search_location_around_lat_lon with the location parameter as \"Golden Gate Bridge\", but without relying on current coordinates. However, the function's design requires current coordinates if not provided, which causes the error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects that even when searching for a specific location, it needs the current location to calculate distance or something. But that doesn't make sense for a landmark like the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is because the function is trying to get the current location to use as a reference, but since it's not available, it throws an error. However, the actual search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" should not depend on the user's current location. So maybe this is a flaw in the function's design, but as per the given tools, we have to work with it.\n\nGiven that, the correct approach is to first check the location service status. If it's off, then we can't proceed, so we need to inform the user to enable it. But the user might not need their current location to find the Golden Gate Bridge. This is a bit of a catch-22.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. If location services are off, perhaps we can't get the current location, but the search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" might still work if we don't use the current location. However, the function requires latitude and longitude to be provided or defaults to current. Since they're not provided, it tries current, which fails.\n\nSo, to avoid that, maybe we need to provide latitude and longitude. But we don't know them. However, maybe the Golden Gate Bridge has well-known coordinates. For example, it's in San Francisco, around 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W. If I can use those, then call search_lat_lon with those coordinates to get the address, but the user is asking for the location, so maybe that's the way.\n\nWait, the user asked \"Where's the Golden Gate Bridge\", so the answer is its address or coordinates. If I can get the coordinates via another method, but according to the tools, the only way is through search_location_around_lat_lon or search_lat_lon.\n\nAlternatively, use search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Golden Gate Bridge\" and manually provide the known coordinates. But I don't have those in the system. Wait, but maybe the function can find it without current coordinates if we specify the location name. However, the error occurred because it tried to use current location.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct step is to first check the location service status. Let's call get_location_service_status to see if it's enabled. If it's not, then we can't proceed, so we need to ask the user to enable it. But the user might not need their current location for this query.\n\nWait, but the error message says \"PermissionError: Location service is not enabled.\" So the function tried to access location services, which are off. Therefore, to perform the search, location services must be enabled. Even though the user is asking for a specific location, the system requires location services to be on. That seems odd, but given the tools, that's the case.\n\nSo, the next step is to check the location service status. Let's call get_location_service_status. Then, if it's off, inform the user to enable it. But since the user is asking for the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a fixed location, maybe there's a way around it. However, according to the tools provided, the function requires location services to be on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is because the function tried to get current location, but if we provide latitude and longitude, it wouldn't need it. So, if I can find the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge from another source, but within the tools,",

I tried to look it up, but there were a bunch of errors along the way.\n\nFirst, the location services were off, so I checked that and tried to turn them on. But then it said location services can't be turned on in low battery mode. So I checked the low battery mode status and it was on. So I turned off low battery mode, then tried to enable location services again. That worked.\n\nBut then there was a Wi-Fi error. The Wi-Fi was off, so I turned it on. After that, the search finally worked.\n\nNow, the response from the search has the address: Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA. The coordinates are 37.8199° N, 122.4786° W. Also, there's a phone number, website, and other details.\n\nThe user just wants to know where it is, so the main info is the address and maybe the city. I should present the full address clearly. Also, mention the city and state since that's commonly known. Maybe include the coordinates if they're useful, but the user might just need the general location.\n\nLet me check if the address makes sense. The full address is listed as \"Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA\". Sometimes \"Brg\" is short for Bridge, so that's correct. San Francisco, CA is the right location.\n\nSo the answer should state the address, city, and maybe note it's a famous landmark. Also, the website could be helpful if they want more info. But the user just asked \"Where's the Golden Gate Bridge\", so keeping it concise with the location details.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is located at:  \n**Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA**  \n\nIt spans the Golden Gate Strait in San Francisco, California, connecting the city to Marin County.
