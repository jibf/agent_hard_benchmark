The tools provided include add_contact, modify_contact, remove_contact, search_contacts, and search_location_around_lat_lon. \n\nThe user wants to know their friends, which probably refers to contacts with a specific relationship. The search_contacts function allows searching by relationship, among other fields. The relationship parameter in search_contacts is fuzzy matched, so if the user has contacts where the relationship is \"friend\" or something similar, this function might find them.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify any parameters. The search_contacts function doesn't require any parameters, so maybe calling it without arguments would return all contacts. However, the user is specifically asking for friends, so I should look for contacts where the relationship is \"friend\". But since the user hasn't provided any details, maybe I need to ask for clarification. Wait, the instructions say not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user's question is \"Who are my friends?\" which is pretty vague. Do they mean contacts with the relationship set to \"friend\"? Or maybe they consider some contacts as friends but the relationship field might not be explicitly set. The problem is, without knowing how the user has set up their contacts, it's hard to tell. The search_contacts function can take a relationship parameter, but if the user hasn't specified which relationship term they use (like \"friend\", \"buddy\", etc.), the search might not be accurate.\n\nBut according to the tools, the search_contacts function's relationship parameter is fuzzy matched. So if I search for relationship \"friend\", it might pick up similar terms. However, the user hasn't provided any specific criteria. The question is too ambiguous. The assistant should ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.\n\nWait, the initial instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo in this case, the user's request is ambiguous because \"friends\" isn't a specific parameter. The assistant needs to ask what criteria they want to use to define friends, like a specific relationship field value, or maybe they need to search by name, etc.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to ask for clarification rather than call a function.\n</think>\n\nTo help you find your friends in your contacts, I'll need a bit more information. Could you clarify:\n\n1. Do you want to search for contacts with a specific relationship label (e.g., \"friend\", \"best friend\") in your contact database?\n2. Would you like to search by name, phone number, or other criteria instead?\n\nThis will help me perform an accurate search for your contacts.",

The modify_contact function requires the person_id and the new relationship. So I took each person_id from the search results and called modify_contact twice, once for each ID.\n\nThe tool responses were \"None\", which probably means the modifications were successful. Now I should confirm to the user that both contacts have been updated. Let me check if there's anything else the user might need. They didn't mention other criteria, so just a straightforward confirmation should be good. Make sure to mention both names to be clear.\n</think>\n\nI've successfully updated both contacts in your address book:\n\n- Fredrik Thordendal's relationship status changed from \"friend\" to \"enemy\"\n- John Petrucci's relationship status changed from \"friend\" to \"enemy\"\n\nYour contact book now reflects these updated relationships.

The user initially asked to update all their friends to enemies, which I handled by searching for contacts with the relationship \"friend\" and then modifying each to \"enemy\". Now, they're asking to change them back to friends.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm which contacts need to be changed. Since the previous action changed two specific contacts (Fredrik and John) from friend to enemy, changing them back would require targeting those same person IDs. The user didn't specify any new criteria, so it's safe to assume they want the same two contacts reverted.\n\nI should check if there's a need to search again, but given the context, the user is directly referencing the previous action. So, using the same person IDs from the last modification makes sense. I'll call modify_contact for each person_id with the relationship set back to \"friend\".\n\nNo additional parameters are needed since only the relationship is changing. The tool calls should be straightforward. I'll generate the two modify_contact functions with the correct IDs and new relationship value.\n</think>\n\nI've successfully reverted both contacts back to \"friend\" status:\n\n- Fredrik Thordendal's relationship status changed from \"enemy\" to \"friend\"\n- John Petrucci's relationship status changed from \"enemy\" to \"friend\"\n\nYour contact book now reflects these updated relationships.
