    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions to use here. The main task is setting a reminder. There's the add_reminder function which requires content and a reminder_timestamp. But the user didn't specify a time, just the location. Wait, the reminder needs a timestamp. Maybe the user expects a default time, but the function requires it. Hmm, the problem is the user didn't mention when they want the reminder. So I need to ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the user says \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\" They didn't specify a time. The add_reminder function needs a reminder_timestamp as a POSIX timestamp. Since the user didn't provide a time, I can't generate that timestamp. Also, the location is mentioned as Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, so I might need to get the latitude and longitude for that location to set the location-based reminder.\n\nLooking at the tools available, there's search_location_around_lat_lon which requires a location string. But to use that, maybe I need the current latitude and longitude? Wait, the function parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon have latitude and longitude as optional, defaulting to current if not provided. But I don't have the current location. Alternatively, maybe I should first use search_lat_lon? Wait, no. The user is referring to a specific location: Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So perhaps I need to search for that location's coordinates.\n\nWait, there's search_location_around_lat_lon which takes a location string. The required parameter is location. So maybe I can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the latitude and longitude. But the function's description says it searches around a given lat/lon, but the parameters have location as required, and lat/lon as optional. Wait, the description says: \"Location to search around. Defaults to current latitude if not provided\". Wait, no, the parameters are: location (string, required), latitude (number, optional, defaults to current), longitude (same). Wait, the function is search_location_around_lat_lon, which seems to search for a location around a given lat/lon. But the user is providing the location name, so maybe this function is meant to find coordinates for a location name. Wait, the description is a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nThe function search_location_around_lat_lon has parameters: location (required string), latitude (optional number), longitude (optional number). So maybe it's used to search for places around a certain lat/lon, but the location parameter is the query. For example, if you want to find \"Whole Foods\" around a certain lat/lon. But in this case, the user is saying \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", so the location parameter would be \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\", and maybe we don't have the lat/lon yet. But without a starting lat/lon, how does it work? The function might require lat/lon to search around, but they are optional, defaulting to current. But if we don't have current lat/lon, maybe the function can still search based on the location string alone? The description isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another function. Wait, there's search_lat_lon which requires latitude and longitude. But the user hasn't provided those. So perhaps the correct approach is to first get the coordinates for \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" using search_location_around_lat_lon, even if lat/lon are not provided. Wait, but the function requires location, which we have. Let me check the required parameters: for search_location_around_lat_lon, only location is required. So maybe we can call it with just the location string, and it will return the coordinates. That makes sense. So the function might be designed to take a location name and return its coordinates, perhaps using some geocoding service.\n\nSo first step: call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get the latitude and longitude of that place.\n\nOnce we have the coordinates, we can then set the reminder with add_reminder, including the content, the reminder timestamp (but user didn't specify time), and the lat/lon.\n\nBut the user didn't specify when to be reminded. The add_reminder function requires reminder_timestamp. So we need to ask the user for the time they want the reminder. However, the user's message doesn't include a time. So perhaps the assistant should ask for clarification on the time.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because they didn't specify when to set the reminder. So the correct action is to ask for the time. However, the user might expect the reminder to trigger when they arrive at the location. But the function parameters for add_reminder include latitude and longitude as optional, which would be for location-based reminders. So maybe the reminder is supposed to trigger when the user is near that location. But the reminder_timestamp is still required. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at add_reminder parameters: reminder_timestamp is required. So even if it's a location-based reminder, you still need a timestamp. Maybe the timestamp is a fallback in case the location trigger doesn't happen? Or perhaps the location-based reminder uses the timestamp as the deadline. The description isn't clear, but according to the function definition, reminder_timestamp is required.\n\nSo the user didn't specify a time, so we can't fill that in. Therefore, we need to ask for the time. However, maybe the user intended the reminder to be location-based, so the timestamp might be set to a far future date, but the function requires it. Alternatively, maybe the timestamp is the time when the reminder should trigger if the location isn't reached. But without knowing, we can't assume.\n\nGiven the instructions, since the user didn't specify a time, it's ambiguous, so we should ask for clarification. But the problem says to use the tools if possible, but if ambiguous, ask.\n\nWait, the user's message is: \"Remind me to buy chocolate milk at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek.\"\n\nThey mentioned the location but not the time. So the assistant needs to ask when the user wants to be reminded. However, maybe the reminder is supposed to trigger upon arrival at the location, so the timestamp might not be necessary, but the function requires it. So there's a conflict here.\n\nWait, looking at the add_reminder function parameters: reminder_timestamp is required. So even for location-based reminders, you need a timestamp. Therefore, the user must provide a time. Since they didn't, the assistant should ask for the time.\n\nBut the user might not realize that, so the correct step is to prompt them for the time they want the reminder.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the timestamp can be derived from the location, but that doesn't make sense. Timestamp is a specific point in time.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to ask the user when they want to be reminded. However, the problem states that if the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification.\n\nSo the assistant should respond by asking for the time. But the user might have intended the reminder to trigger when they arrive at Whole Foods, so maybe the timestamp is not needed, but the function requires it. Therefore, the assistant needs to clarify.\n\nWait, but the add_reminder function has latitude and longitude as optional parameters. So perhaps the reminder is set to trigger when the user is at that location, and the timestamp is a deadline. For example, remind me to buy chocolate milk when I'm at Whole Foods, but if I haven't gone by 5 PM, remind me then. But the user didn't specify either.\n\nGiven that the function requires reminder_timestamp, and the user didn't provide a time, the assistant must ask for the time.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. The user wants a reminder for a location, so we need the coordinates of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So first, call search_location_around_lat_lon with location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" to get lat/lon.\n\nBut wait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon's description is unclear. Let me check again.\n\nFunction name: search_location_around_lat_lon\n\nParameters: location (required string), latitude (optional), longitude (optional)\n\nDescription: \"Location to search around. Defaults to current latitude if not provided\"\n\nWait, maybe the function is meant to search for locations near a given lat/lon, but the user is providing the location name. So perhaps this function is for finding places around a certain point, but here we need to find the coordinates of a specific place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different function. Wait, there's also search_lat_lon, which requires latitude and longitude. But we don't have those yet.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is:\n\nTo set a location-based reminder, we need the latitude and longitude of Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. So first, use a function to get those coordinates.\n\nThe available functions that can help are search_location_around_lat_lon and search_lat_lon.\n\nsearch_lat_lon requires lat and lon, which we don't have.\n\nsearch_location_around_lat_lon requires a location string, which we have (\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\"), and optionally lat/lon. Since we don't have lat/lon, but the function allows omitting them (they default to current), but we don't have current either. However, the function might still work by using the location string to geocode the place, ignoring the lat/lon if not provided. Maybe the function is designed to take a location name and return its coordinates, using the lat/lon as a hint if provided.\n\nAssuming that, we can call search_location_around_lat"
