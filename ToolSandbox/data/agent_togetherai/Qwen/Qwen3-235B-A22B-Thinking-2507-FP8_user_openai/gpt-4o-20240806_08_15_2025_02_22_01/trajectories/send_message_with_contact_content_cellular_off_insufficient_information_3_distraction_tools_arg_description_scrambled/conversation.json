There's the send_message_with_phone_number function, which requires a phone number and content.\n\nWait, the problem is that the user didn't provide a phone number. The function needs both phone_number and content. The user mentioned Fredrik Thordendal, but no phone number is given. So I can't proceed without that information. The instructions say not to make assumptions, so I shouldn't guess the phone number. I should ask the user to provide the phone number for Fredrik Thordendal before sending the message. There's no function to look up phone numbers here, so I can't retrieve it myself. Therefore, the correct action is to request the missing phone number from the user.\n</think>\n\nThe function `send_message_with_phone_number` requires a phone number to send the message.

They mentioned they don't know the phone number, so I can't use that function without it.\n\nOther tools are for checking service statuses like cellular, location, and wifi.

There's no tool to look up phone numbers, so I can't retrieve it. \n\nI should inform the user that without the phone number, the message can't be sent. Maybe suggest they find the number first or check if there's another way, but according to the tools given, there's no alternative. So the correct response is to state that the phone number is required and can't proceed without it.\n</think>\n\nThe `send_message_with_phone_number` function requires a valid phone number to send the message.

They've already said they don't know it and aren't sure how to get it.\n\nFirst, I checked the available tools. The only relevant one is send_message_with_phone_number, which needs both phone number and content. The user provided the content but not the number. The other tools are for checking service statuses or enabling/disabling services, which don't help here.\n\nSince there's no function to look up phone numbers, I can't retrieve it. The user might not realize that without the number, the message can't be sent. My previous responses asked for the number, but they still don't have it. Now they're saying they don't know how to get it.\n\nI should explain that the system can't access contact info and suggest alternative ways to find the number, like checking contacts or official sources. But since the tools don't include a contact lookup, I can't help further. Need to be clear that without the number, the action isn't possible.\n</think>\n\nThe system does not have access to contact information or the ability to look up phone numbers (no tool is available for contact retrieval). To send a message, you would need to:\n\n1. Obtain Fredrik Thordendal's phone number through official channels (e.g., verified social media, record label contact)\n2. Provide the number to this system\n\nSince neither the user nor the system can resolve the missing phone number requirement, this request cannot be completed. Would you like to try a different action that doesn't require unknown contact information?"

Since the required parameter `phone_number` cannot be fulfilled for `send_message_with_phone_number`, this action is **impossible to execute** with the current toolset and information.\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Check device service statuses (cellular/wifi/location)?\n2. Toggle cellular/wifi services on/off?\n3. Attempt another action that doesn't require unknown contact information?"
