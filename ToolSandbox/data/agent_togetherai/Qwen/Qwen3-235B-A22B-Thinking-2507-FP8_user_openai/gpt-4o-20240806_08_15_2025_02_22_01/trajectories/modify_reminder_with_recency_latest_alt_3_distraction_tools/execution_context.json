                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out what functions to use here.\n\nSo, the main task is modifying a reminder's time. But to do that, I need the reminder ID. The user didn't specify which reminder, so maybe I should first search for the upcoming one. But how?\n\nWait, the user says \"my upcoming reminder\". That implies there's a specific reminder they want to change. But without knowing the ID, I can't modify it directly. So maybe I need to use the search_reminder function to find the next upcoming reminder.\n\nBut how do I determine which one is \"upcoming\"? Upcoming probably means the one with the nearest reminder_timestamp that's after the current time. So first, I should get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then, search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is greater than the current time, and find the one with the smallest timestamp (the next one).\n\nWait, but the search_reminder function allows setting lower and upper bounds for reminder_timestamp. So if I get the current timestamp, then set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to that current time, and maybe not set an upper bound, but then how do I get the earliest one? The search function returns all matches, so maybe I need to search for reminders after now and then pick the first one.\n\nBut the problem is, the search_reminder function doesn't sort the results. So perhaps I need to retrieve all upcoming reminders and then determine which is the next one. However, the user says \"upcoming\", which likely refers to the very next one.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (using get_current_timestamp).\n2. Search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is greater than current timestamp (lowerbound = current timestamp, upperbound not set).\n3. From the search results, pick the reminder with the smallest reminder_timestamp (the next one).\n4. Then, modify that reminder's timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nBut how do I calculate tomorrow at 5 PM as a POSIX timestamp?\n\nFirst, get current timestamp. Then, shift it by 1 day to get tomorrow's date, but set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting by 1 day might not account for the time. Alternatively, take the current date, add one day, then set the time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nWait, but the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". So regardless of the current time, tomorrow at 5 PM. So if today is Monday, tomorrow is Tuesday 5 PM.\n\nSo, to get that timestamp:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current date and time.\n- Then, set the next day's date with hour 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that datetime info to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp: take current timestamp, shift by 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00. But shifting by 1 day would take the current time and add 24 hours, which might not be exactly tomorrow at 5 PM if the current time is, say, 6 PM. For example, if it's Monday 6 PM, shifting by 1 day would be Tuesday 6 PM, but the user wants Tuesday 5 PM. So that's not correct.\n\nSo better approach: take the current date, add one day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps for the new timestamp:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Add one day to the current date (but need to handle month/year rollover, but the function shift_timestamp might handle that).\nWait, maybe using shift_timestamp: take current timestamp, shift by 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, no. Shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, which might not land exactly on 5 PM. For example, if current time is 3 PM today, shifting by 1 day gives 3 PM tomorrow. But user wants 5 PM tomorrow, so need to adjust.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date and time.\n- Calculate tomorrow's date: current day +1, adjust month/year if needed.\n- Create a new datetime info with tomorrow's date, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut how to calculate tomorrow's date? Well, the shift_timestamp function can shift by 1 day. So take current timestamp, shift by 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day would give the same time tomorrow. So if it's 10 AM now, shifting by 1 day is 10 AM tomorrow. But user wants 5 PM tomorrow, so need to adjust the time.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Shift by 1 day to get tomorrow same time.\n- Then, calculate the difference between that shifted timestamp's time and 17:00, and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, take the current date, add 1 day, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time (ts_now).\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on ts_now to get current date and time (year, month, day, hour, etc.).\n3. Add 1 to the day. If day exceeds the month's days, adjust month and year accordingly. But maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle this. Wait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, so perhaps:\n\n- Take ts_now, shift by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=1), which gives ts_tomorrow_same_time.\n- Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on ts_tomorrow_same_time to get the date (year, month, day) of tomorrow.\n- Then, create a new datetime info with that year, month, day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nYes, that might work.\n\nSo steps:\n\na. Get current timestamp (ts_now).\nb. Shift ts_now by 1 day to get ts_tomorrow_same_time.\nc. Convert ts_tomorrow_same_time to datetime info to get tomorrow's date (year, month, day).\nd. Create new datetime info with (year, month, day, 17, 0, 0).\ne. Convert that to timestamp (ts_new).\n\nBut wait, shifting by 1 day from ts_now gives the same time tomorrow. But we need 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time. So if today is Monday 10 AM, ts_tomorrow_same_time is Tuesday 10 AM. But we want Tuesday 5 PM, so we need to adjust the time.\n\nAlternatively, take the current date, add 1 day, set time to 17:00.\n\nAnother approach: get the current date, add 1 day, then set the time components to 17, 0, 0.\n\nBut how to get the current date's components? Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on ts_now, then add 1 to day, handle rollover, but that's error-prone. Instead, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to ts_now, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Take ts_now, shift by 1 day to get the same time tomorrow.\n- Then, calculate the difference between that shifted time's hour and 17, and adjust.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to:\n\n1. Get ts_now.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current (y, m, d, h, min, sec).\n3. Set new_d = d +1, but handle month/year rollover. However, this is complex.\n4. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to ts_now, which gives the correct date even with rollover.\n5. Then, take that shifted timestamp, convert to datetime info, which gives tomorrow's date at current time.\n6. Then, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0 for that date.\n7. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp → ts_now.\n- Call shift_timestamp with ts_now, days=1 → ts_tomorrow_same_time.\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info on ts_tomorrow_same_time → (y, m, d, h, min, sec, ...).\n- Create new datetime info: y, m, d, 17, 0, 0.\n- Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values → ts_new.\n\nOnce we have ts_new, then we need to find the upcoming reminder to modify.\n\nBut first, we need to find the reminder. The user says \"my upcoming reminder\", which is the next one. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp (ts_now).\n- Search for reminders where reminder_timestamp > ts_now.\n- Among those, the one with the smallest reminder_timestamp is the upcoming one.\n\nSo steps for finding the reminder:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp → ts_now.\n2. Call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = ts_now.\n3. From the results, sort by reminder_timestamp and take the first one (smallest value above ts_now).\n\nBut the search_reminder function returns all reminders matching the criteria, so the assistant would need to process the results to find the earliest one.\n\nHowever, the assistant can't do processing; it has to call functions.",
