    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked how much 2048 USD is in CNY. I called the convert_currency function with the right parameters: amount 2048, from USD, to CNY. The response came back as 14705.152.\n\nNow I need to present this answer clearly. The user probably wants to know the converted amount, so I should state it directly. Let me check if there are any formatting standards for currency. Usually, CNY is written with two decimal places, but the response has three. Maybe it's rounded, but the tool gave 14705.152. I should probably keep it as is or round to two decimals. Wait, the example in the tool description says \"return value corresponds to\", so maybe the API returns a precise number. But in real life, currency conversions often go to two decimal places. However, since the tool response is 14705.152, I should present it as 14,705.15 CNY, rounding to two decimal places. Wait, but the user might expect the exact figure from the tool. Let me check the tool response again: it's 14705.152. So three decimal places. But CNY usually uses two. Hmm. Maybe the tool's API returns more precise, but the standard is two. I'll present it as 14,705.15 CNY, noting that it's approximately. Or maybe the tool's answer is exact, so I should write 14,705.15 CNY. Wait, 0.152 is 15.2 cents, so rounding to the nearest cent would be 15 cents. So 14,705.15 CNY. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the number as given. The problem says \"how much is\", so the exact converted value. Let me check if the tool response is 14705.152, so I should present that as 14,705.15 CNY (rounded to two decimal places) or state the exact value. Since the user didn't specify rounding, but in real-world scenarios, currency is usually to two decimals. So I'll go with 14,705.15 CNY. Also, add a note that exchange rates fluctuate. Wait, the user might not need that, but it's good practice. Let me structure the answer: \"2048 USD is equivalent to approximately 14,705.15 CNY based on the current exchange rate.\" That should be clear and accurate.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is equivalent to **14,705.15 CNY** based on the current exchange rate. Exchange rates may fluctuate, so this value reflects the conversion at the time of the request."
