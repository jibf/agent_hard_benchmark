                "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to get their reminders from yesterday.\n\nFirst, I should check what functions I have available. There's search_reminder, which can look up reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp and reminder_timestamp with lower and upper bounds. Since the user is asking about reminders from yesterday, I probably need to use the reminder_timestamp to find entries where the reminder was set for yesterday.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"yesterday,\" so I need to convert yesterday's date into a timestamp range. To do that, I'll need to know the current date first. But I don't have the current time. Hmm, maybe the system has the current time, but as an AI, I don't. Wait, maybe I should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create the start and end timestamps for yesterday.\n\nWait, but I need to know today's date to figure out yesterday. Since I don't have access to the current date, maybe the system expects me to assume the current date is when the query is made. But as an AI, I can't know the exact current time. However, the user is asking about \"yesterday\" relative to when they're asking, so perhaps I need to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday based on the current time.\n\nBut how do I get the current time? Oh, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used if I know the current date. Wait, but I don't. Wait, maybe the system has a way to get the current time, but since it's not provided here, perhaps I need to use another approach.\n\nWait, there's also the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, but since I don't have a function to get the current time, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp is meant to be used with the current date. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's system provides the current time implicitly. But given the tools provided, I think I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in timestamps.\n\nLet me think: To get yesterday's date range, I need the start of yesterday (00:00:00) and the end of yesterday (23:59:59). To compute that, I need to know today's date. But without knowing today's date, I can't proceed. Wait, but maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the reference. However, since I don't have access to the current time, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with placeholders, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the shift_timestamp function can help. If I can get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get yesterday. But how do I get the current timestamp? There's no function for that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function is intended to be used with the current date, but since the parameters require year, month, day, etc., I can't know those values. Unless the user is expected to provide them, but the user didn't.\n\nWait, the user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't provided. But the user is asking in real-time, so maybe the system expects the assistant to assume the current date is known. However, as an AI without real-time access, I need to handle this.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to use the shift_timestamp function. Let's see: If I could get the current timestamp, then subtract one day. But how to get the current timestamp? There's no function for that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used with the current date, but since I don't know the current date, I can't fill in the parameters. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the system expects me to use the current time as a reference, but since it's not provided, maybe the assistant is supposed to ask for clarification. But the user instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nAh, right! The user's request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't specified. However, in real-world scenarios, \"yesterday\" would refer to the day before the current day when the query is made. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the current date, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, but maybe the system has a way to get the current time, but the tools provided don't include a function to get the current timestamp. The available functions are datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires explicit date parameters. So without knowing the current date, I can't compute yesterday's timestamp range.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to ask for clarification. But the user instruction says to use the tools if possible. Wait, the user instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions... Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo in this case, the user is asking about \"yesterday,\" but without knowing the current date, it's ambiguous. However, in practice, when a user asks this, they mean relative to the current date. But since the assistant can't know the current date, perhaps it's supposed to proceed by assuming that the necessary date information can be derived.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant is supposed to use the system's current time, but since it's not provided in the tools, perhaps the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should first call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp, but there's no function to get the current timestamp. This is a dead end.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the timestamp for yesterday's start and end. Let's assume that the current date is known (even though it's not provided), and proceed to compute the timestamps. But since the assistant can't know the current date, this is an assumption, which the instructions say not to make.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to ask for clarification. However, the problem states that the assistant should use the tools to assist. Wait, the user instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo in this case, the user's request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" isn't defined without a reference date. But in reality, \"yesterday\" is relative to the current date, which the system should know. However, since the tools don't provide a way to get the current date, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the assistant should ask for clarification.\n\nBut the problem says to use the tools if possible. Wait, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed by using the current date as implied. Let's try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the start and end timestamps for yesterday.\n   - To do this, need to know today's date.\n   - Since today's date isn't provided, but the user is asking in real-time, perhaps the assistant should assume that the current date is available through some means.\n\nBut given the tools, perhaps the assistant can use datetime_info_to_timestamp for yesterday's date. Wait, but how to get yesterday's date components (year, month, day)?\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp on the current timestamp. But again, no current timestamp.\n\nThis is a problem. Since the tools don't include a function to get the current time, the assistant can't compute yesterday's timestamps. Therefore, the request is ambiguous, and the assistant should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to use the tools. Maybe there's a way. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose the assistant needs to find reminders where the reminder_timestamp is within yesterday's date. To define yesterday's date range:\n\n- Start: 00:00:00 of yesterday\n- End: 23:59:59 of yesterday\n\nTo get these timestamps, need to know the current date. Since the assistant can't know the current date, perhaps it's expected to use the system's current time, but since it's not provided, maybe the assistant should proceed by using the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with placeholders, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should use the shift_timestamp function. For example, if the current timestamp is T, then yesterday's start is T - 1 day - (current time part). But without knowing T, this is impossible.\n\nGiven that the tools don't provide a way to get the current timestamp, the assistant cannot compute the required timestamps for yesterday. Therefore, the correct action is to ask the user to clarify the date they're referring to, or specify that the request is ambiguous.\n\nBut the user instruction says to use the tools if possible. Wait, perhaps the assistant can make a function call to get the current timestamp via another method. But looking at the tools, there's no function to get the current time.\n\nWait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function requires a timestamp, but without a timestamp, it's not helpful.\n\nHmm. This is a catch-22. The assistant needs the current timestamp to find yesterday's range, but can't get the current timestamp with the provided tools.\n\nGiven the instructions not to make assumptions, the correct response is to ask for clarification. However, the problem might expect the assistant to proceed by assuming that the current date is known and use the tools to calculate the timestamps.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date's components. But since the current date isn't provided, the assistant can't fill in the parameters. Therefore, it's impossible to proceed without making assumptions.\n\nThus, the correct action is to ask the user to specify the date they're referring to, since \"y",
