The response was 1764219600.0.\n\nNow, I need to convert that timestamp into a human-readable date. Let me check what date that corresponds to. POSIX timestamps are seconds since January 1, 1970.\n\nLet me calculate: 1764219600 seconds. Let me see, maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that 1 day is 86400 seconds. Let's divide 1764219600 by 86400 to get the number of days since the epoch.\n\n1764219600 / 86400 = 20419.208333... So approximately 20,419 days.\n\nNow, starting from 1970-01-01, adding 20,419 days. Let's see, maybe using a converter would help, but since I can't do that here, I'll estimate.\n\nEach year is about 365 days. 20419 / 365 ≈ 56 years. 56 years from 1970 is 2026. But 56*365 = 20440, which is a bit more than 20419, so maybe 2025.\n\nWait, 2025 - 1970 = 55 years. 55*365 = 20075 days. 20419 - 20075 = 344 days. So 55 years and 344 days.\n\nWait, but leap years complicate this. From 1970 to 2025, how many leap years? Leap years are every 4 years, except century years not divisible by 400. From 1972 to 2024, inclusive. 2024-1972=52 years, 52/4=13, but need to check exact count.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can recall that Thanksgiving in the US is the fourth Thursday of November. So for 2023, Thanksgiving was on November 23. But the user didn't specify a year, so the function probably defaults to the current year. Wait, the current year when the user asked? But since I don't have real-time data, but the function's description says if year is not provided, it defaults to current year.\n\nAssuming the current year is 2023, but the timestamp given is 1764219600. Let me check what date that is.\n\nWait, 1764219600. Let's see, 1764219600 divided by 86400 is 20419.208333 days.\n\nStarting from 1970-01-01, adding 20419 days.\n\nLet me use a known date: January 1, 2023 is 1672531200 (since 2023-1970=53 years, but with leap years). Wait, maybe better to check a timestamp converter.\n\nWait, 1764219600. Let me check an online converter (but since I can't actually do that, I'll have to estimate).\n\nWait, November 2025: Let's see, 2025-11-27 is Thanksgiving? Wait, fourth Thursday of November 2025.\n\nNovember 1, 2025 is a Saturday. So Thursdays would be 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th. So Thanksgiving would be November 27, 2025.\n\nLet me check the timestamp for November 27, 2025 at 00:00:00 UTC.\n\nCalculating the timestamp:\n\nFrom 1970-01-01 to 2025-11-27.\n\nTotal years: 55 years (1970-2025).\n\nNumber of leap years between 1970 and 2025: 1972, 1976,..., 2024. That's (2024-1972)/4 +1 = (52)/4 +1=13+1=14? Wait 1972 to 2024 inclusive, step 4: 2024-1972=52, 52/4=13, so 13+1=14 leap years.\n\nTotal days: 55*365 +14 = 20075 +14=20089 days.\n\nBut November 27 is the 331st day of the year (since 2025 is not a leap year: 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+27= 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +31=212, +31=243, +30=273, +31=304, +27=331).\n\nSo total days from 1970-01-01 to 2025-11-27: 20089 + 331 -1 = 20419 days (since Jan 1 is day 1, so 331 days into the year means 330 days after Jan 1).\n\n20419 days * 86400 seconds/day = 20419 *86400 = let's calculate 20000*86400=1,728,000,000 and 419*86400=36,201,600. Total 1,728,000,000 +36,201,600=1,764,201,600 seconds.\n\nBut the timestamp given is 1,764,219,600.0. Wait, 1,764,219,600 minus 1,764,201,600 is 18,000 seconds, which is 5 hours. So 1,764,201,600 is November 27, 2025 at 00:00:00 UTC, and adding 5 hours would be 05:00:00 UTC. But Thanksgiving in the US is observed on Thursday, but the exact time might depend on when the holiday is celebrated. However, holidays are usually observed on the day, so the timestamp might correspond to midnight of that day in a specific timezone.\n\nWait, maybe the function returns the timestamp at 00:00:00 in the local US time, but converted to UTC. For example, if Thanksgiving is on November 27, 2025, in New York (UTC-5), then 00:00 EST would be 05:00 UTC on November 27. So the timestamp would be for 05:00 UTC on November 27, 2025, which is 1764219600.\n\nLet me verify: 1764219600 seconds.\n\nDivide by 86400: 1764219600 /86400 = 20419.208333... days.\n\n20419 days since 1970-01-01 is 2025-11-27 (as calculated earlier), and 0.208333 days is 5 hours (since 0.208333 *24=5). So 5 hours into the day, which would be 05:00 UTC on 2025-11-27.\n\nBut Thanksgiving in the US is on the fourth Thursday of November, which in 2025 is November 27. So the timestamp corresponds to November 27, 2025 at 05:00 UTC, which would be midnight in EST (since EST is UTC-5).\n\nTherefore, the timestamp 1764219600.0 corresponds to Thanksgiving Day in 2025.\n\nWait, but why 2025? The user didn't specify a year, so the function defaults to the current year. But if the current year when the user asked",
