                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So first, I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" refers to. Since the current timestamp they provided is 1755246092.650343, which converts to August 15, 2025, at 4:21:32 AM.\n\nWait, so if today is August 15, 2025, then yesterday would be August 14, 2025. But I need to get the exact timestamp range for yesterday. The user probably wants all reminders that were set for yesterday's date.\n\nBut the search_reminder function requires timestamp bounds. So I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps. Let me think. To get yesterday's date, I can take the current timestamp and subtract one day. But wait, the current timestamp is August 15, so subtracting one day would give August 14.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for todos from yesterday, which would be the entire day of August 14. So I need the lower bound as the start of August 14 (midnight) and upper bound as the start of August 15 (midnight).\n\nFirst, I need to find the timestamp for the start of yesterday. Let's see. The current timestamp is 1755246092.650343, which is August 15, 2025, 4:21 AM. To get the start of August 14, I can take the current timestamp, subtract one day, and then set the time to 00:00:00.\n\nBut how to compute that. Maybe using the shift_timestamp function. Let me check the tools available. There's a shift_timestamp function that can adjust a timestamp by weeks, days, etc.\n\nWait, but first, maybe I should get the current timestamp's date info, then compute the start of yesterday. The timestamp_to_datetime_info gave us the current date as 2025-08-15. So yesterday is 2025-08-14.\n\nTo get the start of August 14, which is 00:00:00 on that day, I need to convert that date to a timestamp. Alternatively, take the current timestamp, subtract the time part (hours, minutes, seconds) to get to the start of today, then subtract one day to get to the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is 1755246092.650343. Let's see, the datetime info shows hour=4, minute=21, second=32. So the start of today (August 15) would be current timestamp minus 4 hours, 21 minutes, 32 seconds. Then subtract 24 hours to get to the start of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, using the shift_timestamp function. Let's see, if I take the current timestamp and subtract 1 day, but also adjust to the start of the day.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is to take the current timestamp, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the date components, then construct the start of yesterday.\n\nBut perhaps using shift_timestamp. Let's see: current timestamp is 1755246092.650343. To get the start of yesterday, we can subtract the current time's hours, minutes, seconds, and then subtract one more day.\n\nWait, the current time is 4:21:32 on the 15th. So the start of the 15th is 1755246092.650343 minus 4*3600 + 21*60 +32 seconds. Then subtract 24*3600 to get to the start of the 14th.\n\nBut maybe there's a function to do that. The shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, use the timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the date parts, then calculate the timestamp for the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, the timestamp_to_datetime_info gives year, month, day, etc. So for yesterday, it's year=2025, month=8, day=14. To get the timestamp for 2025-08-14 00:00:00, we can perhaps use some date math, but the tools don't have a function to convert date parts to timestamp. Hmm.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function can take a timestamp and shift it. So if I take the current timestamp, subtract the current time (to get to start of today), then subtract one day.\n\nCurrent timestamp: 1755246092.650343 (Aug 15, 4:21:32)\n\nTo get to start of today (Aug 15, 00:00:00), subtract 4 hours, 21 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nSo shift_timestamp with timestamp=current, hours=-4, minutes=-21, seconds=-32.\n\nThen, to get start of yesterday (Aug 14, 00:00:00), subtract 24 hours from that.\n\nSo first shift to start of today, then shift back one day.\n\nBut the user wants reminders for yesterday, so the reminder_timestamp should be between start of yesterday and start of today.\n\nWait, the reminder_timestamp is when the reminder should be reminded. So if the user is asking for todos from yesterday, they probably mean reminders that were set to trigger on yesterday's date.\n\nTherefore, the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound should be the start of yesterday (midnight), and reminder_timestamp_upperbound should be the start of today (midnight).\n\nSo to get those two timestamps:\n\n1. Start of yesterday: August 14, 00:00:00\n2. Start of today: August 15, 00:00:00\n\nWe need to calculate these two timestamps.\n\nGiven current timestamp is 1755246092.650343 (Aug 15, 4:21:32), start of today is current timestamp minus 4h21m32s.\n\nSo start_of_today = current_timestamp - (4*3600 + 21*60 +32) = 1755246092.650343 - (15692) = let's compute that.\n\n4*3600=14400, 21*60=1260, 32=32. Total 14400+1260=15660 +32=15692 seconds.\n\nSo start_of_today = 1755246092.650343 - 15692 = 1755230400.650343.\n\nThen start_of_yesterday = start_of_today - 86400 (24*3600) = 1755230400.650343 -86400 = 1755144000.650343.\n\nBut since we need the lowerbound as start_of_yesterday (inclusive) and upperbound as start_of_today (exclusive), so the reminder_timestamp should be >= start_of_yesterday and < start_of_today.\n\nBut the search_reminder function uses lowerbound and upperbound parameters. So we can set:\n\nreminder_timestamp_lowerbound = start_of_yesterday\n\nreminder_timestamp_upperbound = start_of_today\n\nBut to compute start_of_yesterday and start_of_today, we need to use the shift_timestamp function.\n\nAlternatively, use the current timestamp, shift back by 1 day and adjust for the time.\n\nWait, perhaps using the shift_timestamp function to subtract 1 day from the current timestamp, but also adjust to the start of the day.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, take the current timestamp, use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the date, then set the time to 00:00:00 for yesterday.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to construct a timestamp from date parts. So the way to get start of yesterday is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (already done: 1755246092.650343)\n2. Convert to datetime info (done: 2025-08-15 04:21:32)\n3. Calculate the timestamp for 2025-08-14 00:00:00.\n\nTo do that, perhaps shift the current timestamp back by 1 day and 4 hours 21 minutes 32 seconds.\n\nWait, current time is 4:21:32 on the 15th. To get to 00:00:00 on the 14th, we need to subtract 1 day and 4h21m32s.\n\nSo total shift: days=-1, hours=-4, minutes=-21, seconds=-32.\n\nUsing shift_timestamp with those parameters on the current timestamp.\n\nLet me check the shift_timestamp function parameters. It takes timestamp, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds.\n\nSo:\n\ntimestamp",
