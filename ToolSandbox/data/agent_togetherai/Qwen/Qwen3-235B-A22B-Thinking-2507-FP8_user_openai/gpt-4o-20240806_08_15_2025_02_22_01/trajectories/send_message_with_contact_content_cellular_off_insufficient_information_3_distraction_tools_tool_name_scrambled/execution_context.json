The user wants to send a message to Fredrik Thordendal with the content \"How's the new album coming along.\" I need to figure out which function to use here.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's the messaging_1 function. Its description says it sends a message using a phone number. The parameters required are phone_number and content. \n\nWait, but the user didn't provide a phone number. They just mentioned Fredrik Thordendal's name. Hmm, the problem is that the function needs a phone number as a string. Since the user didn't specify the number, I can't assume it. The instructions say not to make assumptions about values, so I should ask for clarification.\n\nBut the user also said \"Resolve any issue alone.\" Maybe that means I have to handle it without asking? Wait, no. The initial instruction says if a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. The user didn't provide the phone number, so it's ambiguous. But the user's message says \"Resolve any issue alone,\" which might mean they expect me to handle it without further input. But according to the guidelines, I shouldn't assume values. So I need to check if there's a way to proceed.\n\nWait, maybe Fredrik Thordendal's phone number is known? But as an AI, I don't have access to personal contact details. The function requires the phone number, so without it, I can't call messaging_1. The user must provide the number. Since it's not given, I should ask for it. But the user said \"Resolve any issue alone,\" which might be conflicting. Wait, maybe \"Resolve any issue alone\" refers to the assistant handling the task without user intervention, but in this case, the necessary info is missing. \n\nThe correct step here is to point out that the phone number is missing and request it. However, the user instruction says \"if a user request is ambiguous, ask for clarification.\" So I need to ask for the phone number. But the user's message includes \"Resolve any issue alone,\" which might mean they want me to proceed without asking. But according to the rules, I shouldn't assume. So perhaps the right move is to inform the user that the phone number is needed.\n</think>\n\nThe request to send a message requires a phone number, but none was provided. To proceed, I need the phone number for Fredrik Thordendal. Could you please provide the recipient's phone number?",

There's setting_0 for cellular service status, setting_2 for location, setting_4 for wifi, setting_5 to enable/disable cellular, and setting_8 for wifi. None of these seem related to retrieving contact information or phone numbers.\n\nThe user said they don't know the phone number, so without that, the messaging function can't be called. The assistant's job is to resolve the issue alone, but if the necessary info isn't there, maybe the correct response is to inform the user that the phone number is required and can't proceed without it.\n\nWait, the user told me to \"Resolve any issue alone.\" But if the issue is missing phone number, and there's no tool to get it, then I should state that it's impossible. So the answer should explain that without the phone number, the message can't be sent, and no tools are available to retrieve it. Therefore, the task can't be completed as is.\n</think>\n\nThe messaging function requires a valid phone number to send a message.
