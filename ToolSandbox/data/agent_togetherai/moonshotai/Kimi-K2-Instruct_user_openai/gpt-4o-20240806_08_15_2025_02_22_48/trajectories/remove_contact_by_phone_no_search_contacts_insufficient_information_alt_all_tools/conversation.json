You might be able to see this in your phone's contact list, or if you know any additional details about the contact like their name, I might be able to help identify them through other means.\n\nWould you happen to know the contact's name or any other identifying information that could help locate them?"

The contact removal system requires that specific person_id identifier.\n\nHere are a couple of options:\n\n1. **Manual lookup**: You could check your phone's contact app directly and look for the entry with phone number +12453344098 - it should show a contact ID or allow you to delete it from there.\n\n2. **If you run into this contact**: The next time you see this phone number appear in your contacts (like when you add or modify someone), please note the person_id so I can help remove it.\n\nUnfortunately, without a search capability in the contact system, I can't programmatically locate this contact entry based solely on the phone number. Your phone's native contact manager would be the most direct way to handle this deletion for now."
