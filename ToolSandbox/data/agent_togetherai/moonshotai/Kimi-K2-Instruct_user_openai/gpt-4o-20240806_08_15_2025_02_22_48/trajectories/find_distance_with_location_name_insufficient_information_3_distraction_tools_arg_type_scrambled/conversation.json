The functions I have available can only:\n\n1. Search for an address if you give me the name (like \"Golden Gate Bridge\")\n2. Calculate distances between coordinates that you provide\n3. Convert lat/lon to addresses (and vice versa)\n\nSo to help you find your distance from the Golden Gate Bridge, I would still need you to provide your current location (either as coordinates or as a specific address).
