If you have any internet connection, visit `weather.com`, `weather.gov` (U.S.), or your country’s official weather site.  \n2. Enable location (if the site or app asks for it) or simply search for the city or ZIP code you’re physically in (you’ll usually see nearby towns listed automatically).  \n3. Once the site loads, look for the “7-day” or “Daily” forecast and scroll to Friday—it will show the expected low temperature.\n\nIf you can’t access the web right now, text messaging weather services or local TV/phone hotlines often offer the same information for free."
