Nearest well-known landmark – e.g., “Fisherman’s Wharf” or “Oakland Airport.”\n\nGive me any of those and I’ll calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge for you."

Here are three quick ballparks that might still help:\n\n- If you’re in downtown San Francisco (Union Square area) → about 7–8 km north.  \n- If you’re in central Oakland → about 15 km northwest.  \n- If you’re in San José → about 80 km north.\n\nIf you can share even a rough region or city later, I’ll be happy to give a more precise number."
