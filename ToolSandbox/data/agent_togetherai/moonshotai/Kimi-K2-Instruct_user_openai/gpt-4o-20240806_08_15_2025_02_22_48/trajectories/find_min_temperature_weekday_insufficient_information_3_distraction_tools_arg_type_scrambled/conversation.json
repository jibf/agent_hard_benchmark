You could:\n  – open a map app and read out the city name,  \n  – or try a “find my location” web page to get a rough city/latitude-longitude pair.\n\n• If you’re on a shared / public computer or phone, you could at least tell me the **nearest major city**, or even just the **country and state / region**—sometimes weather services will accept that level of detail (especially for widely known cities).\n\nOnce you’re able to give me any identifiable location, I can check the forecast and give you the minimum temperature for Friday."
