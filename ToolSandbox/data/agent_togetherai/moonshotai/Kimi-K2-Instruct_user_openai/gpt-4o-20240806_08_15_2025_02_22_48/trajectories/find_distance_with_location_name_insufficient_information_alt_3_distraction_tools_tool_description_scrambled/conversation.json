(You may drop a “Share location” link and it will display the numbers.)\n\n- **Browser**  \n  – On any desktop/laptop or browser on a mobile device, you can go to a site such as latlong.net or gps-coordinates.org and click “Get My Current Location” (most browsers will prompt you to allow location access). After you permit it, the page will fill in your coordinates.\n\nOnce you see the two numbers (for example 37.7749, –122.4194), just reply with them and I’ll immediately calculate the exact distance in kilometres to the Golden Gate Bridge."

The site instantly prints:  \n        Latitude: 37.7xxxx  \n        Longitude: –122.4xxxx  \n   • Copy both numbers and drop them here.\n\nOnce you’ve pasted those two decimal numbers, I’ll immediately return the precise kilometre distance to the Golden Gate Bridge."
