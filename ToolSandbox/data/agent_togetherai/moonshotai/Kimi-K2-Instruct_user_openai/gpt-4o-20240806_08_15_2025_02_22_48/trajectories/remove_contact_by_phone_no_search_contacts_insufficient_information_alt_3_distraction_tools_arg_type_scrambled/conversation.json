You might be able to do this by checking your phone's contact app or any other system where you can view your contacts listing, then provide me with that person_id so I can remove it for you.\n\nIs there any way you can find the person_id for the contact with that phone number?"

Without the person_id, I cannot process the removal through the available tools.\n\nYou have a few options:\n1. Check if there's a way to view your contacts through whatever app/system you're using to see the IDs\n2. If this is a phone-based system, you might be able to delete the contact directly through your phone's contact app\n3. Try to recall any other identifying information about this contact\n\nI wish I could help search by phone number, but the system I have access to requires the specific person_id. Is there any other way I can assist you with your contacts?"
