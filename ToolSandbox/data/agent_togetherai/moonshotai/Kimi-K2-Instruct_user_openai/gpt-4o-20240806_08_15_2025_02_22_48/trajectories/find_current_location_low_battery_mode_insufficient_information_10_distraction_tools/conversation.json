At the bottom of the screen you’ll see something like **40.7589, -73.9851** (those are just example coordinates for Times Square).  \n   Jot down those two numbers and tell them to me—then I can give you the exact street address.\n\nOr, if your device shows something like “Cupertino, California” or any other location description instead of the raw numbers, just share that text and I can proceed from there."

The last option I can try is seeing if the system has already cached your last known location, but that’s not something I can pull with my current tools.\n\nAt this point I think you’ll need native help. Try one of these quick fallbacks:\n\n- Ask another person in the Messages app: tap the “i” button, then Share My Location → Share for One Hour, or  \n- Take a screenshot of your next Uber / Lyft ride screen, or  \n- Snap a photo capturing any visible street signs or landmarks, then use your Photos app’s built-in geotag info (tap the info “i” on the photo → “Show Map”).\n\nOnce you have *any* recognizable street, suburb, or city, I can pinpoint it further for you. Just let me know!"
