However, that forecast information isn't available through the current tools I have access to - my tools help with currency conversion, location searches, date/time calculations, and unit conversions, but don't provide weather data.\n\nTo find how cold it gets this Friday, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Checking a weather app or website like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your local weather service\n2. Asking \"Hey [Google/Alexa/Siri], what's the low temperature this Friday?\"\n3. Watching your local weather forecast on TV\n\nThese sources will give you the actual predicted low temperature for Friday in your area."

Your best options remain:\n\n- Checking a weather website or app\n- Asking your voice assistant\n- Looking at local news weather reports\n\nThese are specifically designed to provide weather data, which is exactly what you need for this question."
