Opening your phone's Contacts app\n2. Searching for the phone number +12453344098\n3. Deleting the contact from there\n\nThis will remove the contact from your phone regardless of how it was originally added to the system. I apologize that I can't directly help with this particular deletion with the tools currently available to me."
