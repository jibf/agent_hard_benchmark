The contact-store functions don’t log call/message times, so the concept of “last contacted” isn’t available.\n\nYour easiest option is probably to:\n\n1. Check your phone’s Recents list (Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, etc.) to see the last outgoing call or text.\n2. Note the person’s current name or number there.\n3. Then tell me the name/number so I can update that contact’s cell to **+10293847563**.\n\nLet me know what you find and I’ll make the change right away!"

So “who you contacted last” can’t be inferred from these tools.\n\nIf you check your Recents list (on your phone or messaging app) and give me even part of the contact name or the old phone number, I can immediately modify that record. Otherwise, the best I can suggest is to:\n\n1. Manually scroll to what looks like the latest contact, or  \n2. Try remembering the first few letters of the name and I’ll do a fuzzy search for it.\n\nOnce you provide any identifying detail, I’ll update their cell to +10293847563 instantly."

Once you do, I’ll immediately change the stored contact to +10293847563.\n\nLet me know when you’ve taken a quick peek at that list—I’ll be ready to update it."
