On any nearby computer or phone  \n   • Open a browser and type “weather Friday” in the address bar.  \n   • Search engines and many weather sites will detect your location and show the low temperature for the upcoming Friday.\n\n2. Use a voice assistant  \n   • Say “Hey Siri” (iPhone), “Hey Google” (Android), or “Alexa” (Amazon devices) and ask,  \n     “What will the low temperature be this Friday?”  \n   • These assistants often know your location automatically.\n\n3. Check a local source  \n   • TV or radio forecasts mention Friday’s low in most weather segments.  \n   • Newspapers or public-display clocks often indicate today’s date if you need that first.\n\nIf you can find today’s date and are willing to share your city (or ZIP/post code), I can at least tell you how to format an online query."

Ask someone nearby for today’s date and your approximate location, then I can tell you exactly how to phrase a later search once you do reach any connected device.  \n2. Listen to a local radio station—weather segments give the day’s low, and they almost always state or imply today’s date (“good Wednesday morning, it’ll drop to 30 °F tonight …”).  \n3. Look for any wall clock, arrival/departure board, or computer screen that might display the date; once you see it, give me the month-day, and I’ll identify Friday’s date for you.\n\nBeyond that, there isn’t a way for me to look up weather details. If any of those sources provide today’s date (and ideally a rough location), let me know and I can at least help you frame an exact query for when you next have access to someone else’s phone or computer."
