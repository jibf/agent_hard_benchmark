I can then look up the approximate coordinates for that location and calculate the distance.\n\n**Option 2: Use a rough estimate**\n- If you're comfortable sharing, even a **landmark nearby** (like \"downtown San Francisco\" or \"Oakland, CA\") would help me get a close approximation.\n\n**Option 3: Use your device**\n- On most phones/computers, you can find approximate coordinates via:\n  - **Google Maps**: Right-click your location and it will show coordinates\n  - **Phone**: Enable location services in a maps app to see your coordinates\n\nWhich approach works best for you?"
