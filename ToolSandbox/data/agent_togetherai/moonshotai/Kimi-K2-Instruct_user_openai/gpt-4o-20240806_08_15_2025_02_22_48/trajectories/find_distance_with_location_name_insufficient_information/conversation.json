Unfortunately, to calculate a precise distance I do need latitude and longitude values.\n\nHowever, here are a few practical ways you can get them quickly on most smartphones:\n\n- **iPhone**: Open the “Compass” app—the coordinates are shown at the bottom.  \n- **Android**: Open Google Maps → tap the blue location dot → choose “Share location” → then “More options” (the three dots) → “Your location” → and you’ll see the decimal latitude & longitude that you can copy.\n\nOnce you have those two numbers, let me know and I’ll immediately tell you how far you are from the Golden Gate Bridge (Latitude 37.8199, Longitude –122.4783)."
