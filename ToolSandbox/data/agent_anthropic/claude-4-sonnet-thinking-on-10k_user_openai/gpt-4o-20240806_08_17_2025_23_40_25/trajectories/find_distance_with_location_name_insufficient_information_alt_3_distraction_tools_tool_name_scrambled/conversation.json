For context:\n\n- If you're elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area: likely under 50 km\n- If you're in Los Angeles: about 600 km\n- If you're in New York: about 4,100 km\n- If you're in another country: could be thousands of km\n\nAny general location info you can share would help me give you a more accurate estimate!"
