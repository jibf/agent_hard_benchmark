Since I need a specific date to search for reminders created \"yesterday,\" here are a few ways we can approach this:\n\n1. **If you can find out today's date** (maybe check your phone, computer, or ask someone), I can then calculate yesterday's date and search for reminders created on that day.\n\n2. **If you remember approximately when you created it** - for example, \"sometime in the last few days\" or \"earlier this week\" - I could search within a broader time range.\n\n3. **If you remember any details about the content** of the todo item (even partial words), I could search by content instead of focusing on the creation date.\n\nWhich approach would work best for you, or do you have any other information that might help narrow down the search?"

The search needs at least some criteria to work with.\n\nWhen you're able to find out today's date or remember any details about the todo item you're looking for, feel free to ask again and I'll be happy to help you search for it!"
