The contact removal function requires the unique person_id identifier rather than the phone number.\n\nTo remove this contact, you would need to:\n1. Look in your phone's contacts app\n2. Find the contact with phone number +12453344098\n3. Look for the contact's unique identifier (person_id) if it's displayed in your contacts app\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to delete the contact directly through your phone's built-in contacts app by searching for that phone number and removing it from there.\n\nI apologize that I can't directly help remove the contact with just the phone number - the system requires the person_id to ensure the correct contact is removed."

Yes, it's a bit of a limitation that the contact removal requires that specific identifier. \n\nGoing directly through your phone's contacts app should work just fine though - you can search for the number +12453344098 and delete it from there. That's often the most straightforward way anyway.\n\nGood luck, and feel free to come back if you need help with anything else!"
