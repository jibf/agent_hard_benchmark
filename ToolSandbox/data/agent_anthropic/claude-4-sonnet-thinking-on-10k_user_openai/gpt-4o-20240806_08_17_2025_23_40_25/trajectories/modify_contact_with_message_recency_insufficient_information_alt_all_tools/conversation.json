Here are your options:\n\n1. **Manual check**: Look at your phone's recent calls or messages yourself to find the person's name or current number\n2. **Browse contacts**: If you have a relatively small contact list, I could search all contacts for you (though this would require you to give me permission to do a broad search)\n3. **Partial information**: If you remember anything about the person (first name, last name, relationship, etc.), I can search for matches\n\nWould any of these approaches work for you?"
