You can often tap on it to see the coordinates.\n\n2. **Settings**: Some devices show coordinates in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, or similar paths.\n\n3. **Voice assistant**: Try asking your device's voice assistant \"What are my coordinates?\" or \"What is my current location?\"\n\n4. **Web browser**: If you have internet access, you can go to a website like whatismyipaddress.com or similar location services that can show your coordinates.\n\nOnce you're able to get your latitude and longitude numbers, I'll be happy to look up what city you're in!"
