All I would need is the current date and time, and I can quickly tell you how many days, hours, and minutes are left.\n\nIf it helps for context, that Christmas Day timestamp corresponds to December 25th - I just can't determine which year or calculate the time difference without knowing where we are right now.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?"
