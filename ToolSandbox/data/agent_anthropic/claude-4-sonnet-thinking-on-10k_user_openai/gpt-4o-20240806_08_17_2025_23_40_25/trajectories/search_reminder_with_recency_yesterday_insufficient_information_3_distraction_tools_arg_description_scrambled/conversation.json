Convert that to a timestamp range to search within\n\nSince neither of us knows the current date, I can't determine which specific day \"yesterday\" refers to.\n\nHere are your options:\n- **Find out the current date** from your device/computer, then tell me so I can search for yesterday's reminders\n- **Search all your reminders** (I can do this without any date filters, though it might return a lot of results)\n- **Remember any detail** about the reminder content, and I can search by keywords\n\nWould you like me to search for all your reminders regardless of date?
