The search didn't find any matches with the criteria I used\n\nHere are a few options to help find your reminders:\n\n1. **Search by content**: If you remember any keywords or phrases from your reminders, I can search for those specifically.\n\n2. **Search by approximate time**: If you have a rough idea of when you might have set reminders (like \"sometime this week\" or \"in the past few days\"), I could search within broader time ranges.\n\n3. **Search all reminders**: I could try to find all your reminders regardless of when they're scheduled, and then we can identify which ones might be upcoming.\n\nWould any of these approaches work for you?
