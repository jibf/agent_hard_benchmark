You would need to look up the current temperature there (from a weather website, app, or other source), and then I can convert whatever Celsius temperature you find into Fahrenheit so you can understand it better.\n\nSo if you find the Grand Canyon temperature in Celsius, just let me know what it is and I'll convert it to Fahrenheit for you right away!"
