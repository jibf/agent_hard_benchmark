The search function requires at least one search criteria (like content, creation time, reminder time, or location)\n\nSince you don't remember today's date or any specific details about the reminder, I can't perform a targeted search.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help:\n- If you can find out what today's date is from another source (phone, computer, calendar), I can then search for reminders created yesterday\n- If you remember even a single word from the reminder content, I can search using that\n- If you remember approximately what time you created it or what time it was set to remind you, that would also help\n\nWould any of these options work for you?"
