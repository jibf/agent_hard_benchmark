Then I can search for reminders created yesterday.\n\n2. **Try to recall any keywords** - Even a single word from the reminder content would help me search for it.\n\n3. **Remember the purpose** - What was the reminder about? Work, personal, an appointment, a task? Any context might help you remember some keywords.\n\nWithout any search criteria, I'm unable to retrieve your reminder.
