This is a limitation of the tools available to me - they're designed to work with information you provide, not to detect your location independently.\n\nIf you're able to access your location information later (through your phone's settings, a maps app, or by asking someone nearby), I'll be happy to help calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge at that time."
