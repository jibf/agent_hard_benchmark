Since you don't have access to that information and I don't have a search function to look up contacts by phone number, I'm unable to help remove this contact through the system.\n\nYour best options would be to:\n\n1. **Check your contact management system directly** - Most contact apps/systems allow you to search by phone number and delete contacts without needing the person_id\n2. **Contact your system administrator** (if this is a business system) - they may be able to help locate the person_id or remove the contact for you\n3. **Use your phone's native contact app** - if this is a personal contact, you can usually search by the phone number and delete it directly\n\nI apologize that I can't be more helpful with the current tools available to me."
