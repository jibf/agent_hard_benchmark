(e.g., \"sometime in the last week of December 2024\")\n\n2. **Think of any keywords**: Even partial words or topics from your todo item could help (e.g., \"meeting\", \"grocery\", \"call\", etc.)\n\n3. **Provide today's date**: If you can check your phone, computer, or any device for today's date, I can then search for reminders created yesterday.\n\nI apologize that I can't be more helpful without these details, but the system requires at least one search parameter to function."
