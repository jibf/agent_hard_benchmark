Without knowing the current date or any specific details about the reminder, I have limited options to help you find it.\n\nHere are a few approaches we could try:\n\n1. **Search all reminders**: I could search for all reminders without any filters, which would show you everything you have. Then you could look through them to find the one from yesterday.\n\n2. **Search by approximate time range**: If you can give me any rough timeframe (like \"sometime in the last week\" or \"within the last few days\"), I could search within that range.\n\n3. **Location-based search**: If you remember where you were when you created the reminder, I could search by location coordinates.\n\nWould you like me to search for all your reminders so you can browse through them? Or do any of the other options work for you?",
