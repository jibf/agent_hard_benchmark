Once you can provide your location in any form, I'll be happy to calculate the distance for you!"

This is actually good for your privacy!\n\nTo get your location, you'd need to:\n- Check your device's built-in location services\n- Use your phone's Maps app to see your current coordinates\n- Look up your current address\n- Or simply tell me what city/area you're in for an approximate distance\n\nOnce you have any location information, I can definitely help calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge!"

Here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. **Approximate distance by region**: If you can tell me even generally where you are (like \"somewhere in Los Angeles\" or \"on the East Coast\"), I can give you a rough distance estimate.\n\n2. **Distance from major cities**: I could calculate distances from various major cities to the Golden Gate Bridge, which might help you estimate based on what's closest to you.\n\n3. **Come back later**: When you have a chance to check your location (maybe when you're near a computer or can check your phone's GPS), feel free to ask again!\n\nFor example, if you're curious about some reference distances:\n- From Los Angeles: about 380 miles\n- From Seattle: about 680 miles  \n- From New York: about 2,570 miles\n- From Chicago: about 1,850 miles\n\nWould any of these approaches be helpful, or would you prefer to revisit this when you can check your specific location?"
