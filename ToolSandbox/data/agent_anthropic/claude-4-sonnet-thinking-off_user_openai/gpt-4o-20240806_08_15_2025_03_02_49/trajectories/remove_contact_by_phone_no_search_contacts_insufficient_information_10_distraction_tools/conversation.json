Unfortunately, the available tools require a person_id (unique identifier) to remove a contact, and I don't have access to a function that can search for contacts by phone number to find the corresponding person_id.\n\nTo remove this contact, you would need to:\n1. Look up the contact with phone number +12453344098 in your contacts app or system\n2. Find the person_id/unique identifier for that contact\n3. Then I can help remove it using that person_id\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to remove the contact directly through your phone's contacts app by searching for the phone number +12453344098 and deleting it from there."
