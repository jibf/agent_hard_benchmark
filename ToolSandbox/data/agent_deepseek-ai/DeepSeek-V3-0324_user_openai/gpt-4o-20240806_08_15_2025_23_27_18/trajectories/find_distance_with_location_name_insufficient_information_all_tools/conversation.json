Here's how you can do it:\n\n### On a Smartphone:\n1. **iPhone (iOS)**:\n   - Open the **Maps** app.\n   - Tap the blue dot that shows your current location.\n   - A small panel will appear with details like \"My Location.\" Tap \"Share My Location\" or look for the coordinates (latitude and longitude) at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. **Android**:\n   - Open **Google Maps**.\n   - Tap the blue dot that shows your current location.\n   - The coordinates (latitude and longitude) will appear in the search bar at the top of the screen.\n\n### On a Computer:\n1. **Google Maps**:\n   - Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).\n   - Right-click on your current location (you may need to allow the browser to access your location).\n   - The coordinates will appear in a pop-up menu.\n\nOnce you have the coordinates, share them with me, and I can calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge for you. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
