It will usually show your current location with a blue dot.\n\n2. **Ask Someone Nearby**: If you're in a public place, you can ask someone nearby for the address or name of the location.\n\n3. **Check Wi-Fi or Mobile Data**: If you're connected to Wi-Fi, the network name might give you a clue (e.g., \"Starbucks_WiFi\"). Mobile data can also help your phone approximate your location.\n\n4. **Look for Landmarks**: Identify nearby landmarks, street signs, or businesses to figure out your location.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with anything else!"
