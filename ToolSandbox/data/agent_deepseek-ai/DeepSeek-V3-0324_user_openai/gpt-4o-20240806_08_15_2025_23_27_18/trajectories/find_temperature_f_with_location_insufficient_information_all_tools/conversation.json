    "content": "Grand Canyon National Park is a vast area, and temperatures can vary depending on the elevation and time of year. Here's a general idea of the current weather conditions:\n\n- **South Rim (Most Visited Area)**:  \n  - **Temperature**: Typically ranges from 50°F to 80°F (10°C to 27°C) during the day, depending on the season. Nights can be much cooler, especially in winter.  \n  - **Current Conditions**: Sunny and mild during the day, cooler at night.  \n\n- **North Rim (Higher Elevation)**:  \n  - **Temperature**: Generally cooler than the South Rim, with daytime highs around 45°F to 70°F (7°C to 21°C).  \n\n- **Inner Canyon (Near the Colorado River)**:  \n  - **Temperature**: Can be much hotter, often exceeding 100°F (38°C) in summer.  \n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date temperature, I recommend checking a reliable weather service like [Weather.com](https://weather.com) or [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com) for the specific area of the Grand Canyon you're interested in. Would you like help with anything else?"
