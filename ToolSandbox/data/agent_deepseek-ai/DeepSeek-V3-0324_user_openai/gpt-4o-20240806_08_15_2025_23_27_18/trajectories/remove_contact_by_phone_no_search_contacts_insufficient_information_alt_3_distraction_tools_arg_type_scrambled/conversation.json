Since the system requires a unique `person_id` (not the phone number) to delete a contact, and you only have the phone number, here’s the best way forward:\n\n1. **Manual Workaround**: You can manually check your contacts list (on your phone or device) and delete the entry with the number **+12453344098**. This is the quickest solution if the automated system isn’t cooperating.\n\n2. **Alternative**: If you’d like, I can guide you through exporting your contacts to a file (like a CSV) where you could search for the number and identify the `person_id` for deletion.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like help with the second option or if you’d prefer to handle it manually!"
