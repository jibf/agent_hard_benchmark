However, here are a few suggestions to help you find the temperature:\n\n1. **Use a Weather App**: Open a weather app on your phone (like Weather, AccuWeather, or The Weather Channel) and allow it to use your location.\n2. **Search Online**: Type \"current weather in [your city]\" into a search engine.\n3. **Ask a Smart Device**: If you have a smart speaker (like Alexa or Google Home), ask, \"What's the temperature right now?\"\n\nIf you'd like, I can still help with other questions or tasks! Let me know.",
