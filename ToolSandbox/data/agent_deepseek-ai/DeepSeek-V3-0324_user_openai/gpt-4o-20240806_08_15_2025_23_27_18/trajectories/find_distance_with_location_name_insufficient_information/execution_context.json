Here’s a fun fact about the Golden Gate Bridge to enjoy instead:\n\n**The Golden Gate Bridge spans 1.7 miles (2.7 km) across the Golden Gate Strait**, connecting San Francisco to Marin County. It’s one of the most iconic bridges in the world and was the longest suspension bridge span when it opened in 1937.\n\nIf you ever get curious about your distance from it later, feel free to reach out with your location details, and I’d be happy to calculate it for you! \n\nIs there anything else I can help with? 😊",
