Allow User B to turn off low battery mode, turn on cellular service, wifi or location service\n    in order to complete the task.\n5.  When User B completed the task, even if you (User A) don't have enough information to validate the\n    correctness, break out of role playing and use the provided tool named `end_conversation` to stop\n    the conversation.\n6.  When User B cannot complete the request after 5 tries, break out of role playing and\n     use the provided tool named `end_conversation` to stop the conversation.\n\nAnswer User B's questions given the following task you (User A) want User B to complete: Find the content of your (User A's) oldest message. You do not have more information.",
