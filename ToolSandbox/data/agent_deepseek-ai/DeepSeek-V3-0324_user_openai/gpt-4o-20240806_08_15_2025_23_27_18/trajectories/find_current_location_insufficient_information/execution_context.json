Describe Your Surroundings**\nIf you can see anything around you, share details like:\n- Street names, building names, or business signs (e.g., \"McDonald's,\" \"Main Street\").\n- Landmarks (e.g., a park, a train station, a large billboard).\n- The type of area you're in (city, countryside, near a highway, etc.).\n\nEven small details can help narrow it down.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Check Your Device's Emergency or Safety Features**\n- **Android**: Some phones have emergency location sharing (e.g., Google Maps' \"Share location\" feature).\n- **iPhone**: You can use \"Find My iPhone\" or emergency SOS to share your location with trusted contacts.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use a Friend or Local Help**\n- Ask someone nearby, like a shopkeeper or passerby, for the address or area name.\n- Call a friend or family member and describe where you are—they might recognize it.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Try a Different Device or App**\n- If you have another phone or tablet, try using its maps app.\n- Use a web browser on a computer (if available) to visit [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and click the location icon.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Last Resort: Emergency Services**\nIf you're lost or in an unsafe situation, contact local emergency services (e.g., 911 in the US, 112 in Europe). They can locate you even without coordinates.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if any of these options work, or if you can describe what you see around you! I’m here to help.",
