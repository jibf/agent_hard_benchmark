Open the **Contacts** app.\n2. Find the person you messaged last (they might be at the top of your recent list).\n3. Tap their name, then tap **Edit**.\n4. Update the phone number to `+10293847563`.\n5. Save the changes.\n\n### For iPhone:\n1. Open the **Contacts** app.\n2. Locate the person (check your recent messages for their name).\n3. Tap **Edit** in the top-right corner.\n4. Change the phone number to `+10293847563`.\n5. Tap **Done**.\n\nIf you'd like, I can still assist if you provide even a small clue about the contact! Let me know."
