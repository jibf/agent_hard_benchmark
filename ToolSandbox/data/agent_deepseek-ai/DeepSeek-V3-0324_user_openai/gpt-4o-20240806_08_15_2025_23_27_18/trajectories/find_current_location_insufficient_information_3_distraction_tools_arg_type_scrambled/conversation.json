Let me know if you need further help."

Since I can't access your location directly, here are a few alternative ways to figure out where you are:\n\n### 1. **Look Around for Landmarks or Signs**\n   - Are you near a street, building, or business with a name? For example, a store, restaurant, or street sign.\n   - If you're indoors, check for an address on mail, receipts, or paperwork.\n\n### 2. **Ask Someone Nearby**\n   - If you're in a public place, ask a neighbor, coworker, or staff member for the address or area name.\n\n### 3. **Check Your Device's Location Settings**\n   - **Smartphone**:\n     - Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services (iPhone) or Settings > Location (Android).\n     - Ensure location is turned on, then open Google Maps to see your pinned location.\n   - **Computer**:\n     - Some browsers (like Chrome) may ask for permission to share your location. Allow it, then refresh Google Maps.\n\n### 4. **Use a Wi-Fi Network Name**\n   - If you're connected to Wi-Fi, the network name (SSID) might hint at your location (e.g., \"CoffeeShop_WiFi\").\n\n### 5. **Emergency Services**\n   - If you're lost or in an emergency, call local authorities—they can help pinpoint your location.\n\nLet me know if any of these work, or describe what you see around you, and I can try to help further!"
