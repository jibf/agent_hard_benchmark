It will usually show your current location with a blue dot.\n\n2. **Check Your Device Settings**: On most smartphones, you can find your coordinates in the settings under \"Location\" or \"Privacy.\"\n\n3. **Ask a Smart Assistant**: If you're using a device with a voice assistant (like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa), you can ask, \"Where am I?\" and it might provide your address or coordinates.\n\n4. **Look for Landmarks**: If you're outdoors, look for street signs, business names, or landmarks to help identify your location.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help interpreting coordinates or addresses once you have them!"
