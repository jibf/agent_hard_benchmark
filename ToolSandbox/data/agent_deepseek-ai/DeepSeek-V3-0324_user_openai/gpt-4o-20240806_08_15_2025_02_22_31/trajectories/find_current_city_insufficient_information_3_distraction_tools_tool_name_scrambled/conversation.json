Since you don't know your coordinates, here are a few ways you can find out your current city:\n\n1. **Use a Maps App**: Open Google Maps or Apple Maps on your phone or computer. Your current location should be marked, and the city name will be displayed.\n\n2. **Check Your Device's Location Settings**: On your phone or computer, go to the location settings to see your current city.\n\n3. **Ask a Smart Assistant**: If you're using a device with Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask, \"What city am I in?\"\n\n4. **Look for Landmarks or Signs**: If you're outdoors, check street signs, nearby businesses, or landmarks that might indicate the city.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with any of these steps!"
