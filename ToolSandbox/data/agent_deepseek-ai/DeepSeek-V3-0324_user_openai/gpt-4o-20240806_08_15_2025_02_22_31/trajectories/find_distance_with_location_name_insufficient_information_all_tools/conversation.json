It can show your approximate location based on your IP address (though this may not be very precise).\n\n### 3. **Check Your Device Settings**:\n   - **iPhone**: Go to **Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Share My Location** to see your coordinates.\n   - **Android**: Go to **Settings > Location** and enable high-accuracy mode, then check Google Maps.\n\n### 4. **Describe Your Surroundings**:\n   If you're near a well-known landmark, city, or address, I can estimate the distance from there to the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWould any of these options work for you? Let me know, and I’ll help further!"
