Here’s a quick step-by-step guide:\n\n### **How to Find Your Location on Google Maps**:\n1. **Open Google Maps**:\n   - On your phone: Tap the Google Maps app.\n   - On a computer: Go to [maps.google.com](https://maps.google.com).\n\n2. **Locate the \"My Location\" Button**:\n   - On mobile: Look for the **blue dot** (your current location) or tap the **crosshair icon** (🔍) to center the map on you.\n   - On desktop: Click the **crosshair icon** in the bottom-right corner.\n\n3. **Check Your Coordinates or Address**:\n   - On mobile: Press and hold the blue dot to drop a pin, then swipe up to see details.\n   - On desktop: Right-click on your location and select \"What's here?\" to see coordinates.\n\n4. **Share the Details with Me**:\n   - If you’d like, you can tell me the address or coordinates, and I can provide more info (like nearby places, weather, etc.).\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail? 😊",
