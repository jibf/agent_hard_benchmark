Since the system doesn't track interaction timestamps or prioritize contacts based on recent activity, here's an alternative approach:\n\n1. **Check for \"Self\" Contact**: Sometimes, the most recent or primary contact is marked as \"self.\" I can check if such an entry exists and update it if needed.\n2. **Default or Frequent Contacts**: If you have a default or frequently contacted person, I can identify them based on usage patterns (though this depends on system capabilities).\n\nWould you like me to check for a contact marked as \"self\" first?
