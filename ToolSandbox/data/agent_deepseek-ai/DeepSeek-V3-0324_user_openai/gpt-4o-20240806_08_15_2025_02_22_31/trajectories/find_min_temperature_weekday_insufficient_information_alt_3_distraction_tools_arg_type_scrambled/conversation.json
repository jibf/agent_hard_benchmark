Then, open a maps app (like Google Maps or Apple Maps) to see your current location.\n   - On a computer, you can open Google Maps in a browser, and it may prompt you to share your location.\n\n2. **Ask a Voice Assistant**:\n   - If you have Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask, \"What is my current location?\"\n\n3. **Look for Nearby Landmarks**:\n   - If you're indoors, check for mail, receipts, or any documents that might have your address.\n   - Look outside for street signs, business names, or landmarks.\n\n4. **Use a Weather App**:\n   - Many weather apps (like The Weather Channel or AccuWeather) automatically detect your location if permissions are enabled.\n\nOnce you have your city name or approximate location, let me know, and I can check the weather for this Friday!"
