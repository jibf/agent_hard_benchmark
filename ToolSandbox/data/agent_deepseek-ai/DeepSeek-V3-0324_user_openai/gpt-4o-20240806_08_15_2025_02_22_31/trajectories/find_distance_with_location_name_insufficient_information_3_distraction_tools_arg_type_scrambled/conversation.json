Since we can't determine your current location, here's a fun fact instead:  \n\nThe **Golden Gate Bridge** is located in **San Francisco, California**, and it spans about **1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers)** across the Golden Gate Strait. If you ever find yourself in San Francisco, you can walk, bike, or drive across it for stunning views of the bay and the Pacific Ocean!  \n\nIf you'd like help with anything else, just let me know!"
