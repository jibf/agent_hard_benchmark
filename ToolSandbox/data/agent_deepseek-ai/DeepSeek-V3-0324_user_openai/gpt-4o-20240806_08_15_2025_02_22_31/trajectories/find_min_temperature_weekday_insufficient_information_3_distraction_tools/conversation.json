Since I can't fetch weather data without a specific location, here are a few suggestions for how you might find the lowest temperature for this Friday:\n\n1. **Use a Weather App or Website**:\n   - Visit a weather service like [Weather.com](https://weather.com), [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com), or [NOAA](https://www.weather.gov).\n   - Enter a location you're curious about (e.g., your current city, a place you're planning to visit, or a major city like New York or Tokyo).\n\n2. **Ask for a General Example**:\n   - If you'd like, I can provide an example for a well-known city (e.g., \"The lowest temperature in New York this Friday is expected to be...\"). Let me know if this would help!\n\n3. **Check Local News**:\n   - Local news stations or websites often provide weather forecasts for their area.\n\nFeel free to ask if you'd like assistance with anything else!"
