If so, what is today's date?\n   - Or, could you specify the exact date for this Friday (year, month, day)?\n\n**Please provide:**\n- The location (address/city or direct coordinates)\n- Today's date or the exact date for Friday (including year, month, day).\n\nOnce I have these details, I can proceed!"
