Since I can't directly check weather, here's what I can help with:\n\n1. **Get your current location**  \n   I can tell you exactly where you are right now if that helps.\n\n2. **Find nearby weather stations**  \n   I can search for locations near the Grand Canyon that might have weather information.\n\n3. **Unit conversion**  \n   If you find a temperature in Celsius, I can convert it to Fahrenheit for you.\n\nFor example, I could:\n- Find visitor centers at the Grand Canyon (which often display current temperatures)\n- Calculate the distance from your location to the Grand Canyon\n- Convert any temperature measurements you find\n\nWould you like me to try any of these approaches? Or if you have a specific temperature value (even in Celsius), I can convert it to Fahrenheit immediately.",
