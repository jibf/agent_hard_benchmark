Since I don't have access to look up contacts by phone number, I can't directly remove the contact with phone number `+12453344098` without knowing the specific `person_id`.

Tap the contact > Edit > Delete contact\n\nIf you need help identifying which contact this number belongs to later, or if you'd like me to remove it once you know the contact name, just let me know!
