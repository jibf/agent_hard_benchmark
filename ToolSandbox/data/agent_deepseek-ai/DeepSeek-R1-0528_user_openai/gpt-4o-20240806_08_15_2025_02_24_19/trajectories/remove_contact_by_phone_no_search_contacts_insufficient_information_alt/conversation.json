If you prefer, **I can guide you through finding their contact ID** in your contacts app (the steps depend on whether you're using iOS, Android, or another system).\n\nWould either of these options work for you?

Unfortunately, my current contact management system has a limitation: I can only delete contacts using their unique internal ID (person_id), not directly by phone number. Since I don't have a way to look up IDs using phone numbers either, I can't remove this contact with the information we have.\n\nTo resolve this, here's what I'd recommend:\n1. **Check your contact list manually** - Open your contacts app and search for +12453344098 to find their name/ID\n2. **I can show you all contacts** - If you'd like, I can display your full contact list so you can identify this person\n\nWould either of these options work? I'm truly sorry I can't resolve this directly right now - I'll share this limitation with my developers to improve this in future updates."
