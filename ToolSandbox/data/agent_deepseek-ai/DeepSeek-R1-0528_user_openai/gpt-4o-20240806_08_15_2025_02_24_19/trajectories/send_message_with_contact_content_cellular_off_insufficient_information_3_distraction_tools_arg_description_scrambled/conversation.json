Unfortunately, I don't have the capability to:\n- Access your contact list\n- Look up phone numbers online\n- Convert names to phone numbers\n\nTo successfully send this message, you'd need to provide:\n1. Fredrik's actual phone number in international format (e.g., +4681234567 for Sweden), or\n2. Access to your device's contact list where I could find his number\n\nWould you like me to help with either:\na) Guiding you through finding his number in your contacts, or\nb) Explaining how to format international phone numbers correctly?"
