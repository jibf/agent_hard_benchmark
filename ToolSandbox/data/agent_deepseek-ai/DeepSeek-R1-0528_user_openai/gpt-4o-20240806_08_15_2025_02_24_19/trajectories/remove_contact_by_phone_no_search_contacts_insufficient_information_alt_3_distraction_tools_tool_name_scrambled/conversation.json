This would serve as a separate reminder, though the original contact would still exist until we can identify and delete it.\n\nAlternatively, if you have access to your contact list, you could:\n- Search for \"+12453344098\" in your phone's contacts\n- Share either:\n  - The contact's name\n  - Or the full contact details\n  - Or just the unique ID when you find it\n\nHow would you like to proceed?"
