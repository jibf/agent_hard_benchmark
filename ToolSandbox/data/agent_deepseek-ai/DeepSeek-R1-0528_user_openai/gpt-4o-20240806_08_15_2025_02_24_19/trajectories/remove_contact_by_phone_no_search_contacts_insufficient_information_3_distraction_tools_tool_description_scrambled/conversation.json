You can provide the contact's **name** associated with +12453344098\n2. Or you can ask me to list your contacts first (if that functionality becomes available)\n3. Alternatively, we can add new contacts using `add_contact` where I can store the ID for future reference\n\nWould you like me to help with something else while we work on getting the necessary information to remove this contact?"

If so, I can help you update your own contact card instead\n3. **Add identification**: Next time you add contacts, include names so we can manage them easily\n\nWould you like me to help with something else while we work on getting the necessary details for this removal?"
