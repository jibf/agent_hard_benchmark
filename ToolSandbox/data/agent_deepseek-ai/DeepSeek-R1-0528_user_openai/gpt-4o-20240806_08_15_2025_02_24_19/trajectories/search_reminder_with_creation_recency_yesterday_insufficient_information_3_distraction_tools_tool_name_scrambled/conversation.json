This might show many results if you have multiple reminders.\n\n### Option 2: Provide approximate time details\nIf you recall any of these details about when you created the reminder, it would help:\n- Approximate time of day (e.g., \"morning,\" \"afternoon\")\n- Date of yesterday (if you know it)\n- Event context (e.g., \"before my meeting,\" \"after lunch\")\n\n### Option 3: Describe the reminder content\nIf you describe what the reminder was about, I can search by keyword instead of time.\n\nWhat would you like to do?"
