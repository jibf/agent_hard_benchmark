I don't have the ability to search contacts by phone number\n\nTo resolve this, you could:\n1. Check your device's native contacts app to find the name associated with +12453344098\n2. Let me know if this is your own number (I could look for a contact marked \"is_self\")\n3. Provide any identifying detail about the contact (e.g., \"my aunt's number\" or \"the plumber\")\n\nIf you'd like, I can guide you through finding this contact in your phone's contact manager instead.

Check your phone's native contacts app to find the name attached to this number\n2. If it's your own number, I can help remove a contact marked as \"me\" or \"self\"\n3. If you remember any detail (like \"my gym\" or \"Sarah's work number\"), I can help identify it\n\nI apologize I can't complete this request with just the number. Would you like help with anything else?"
