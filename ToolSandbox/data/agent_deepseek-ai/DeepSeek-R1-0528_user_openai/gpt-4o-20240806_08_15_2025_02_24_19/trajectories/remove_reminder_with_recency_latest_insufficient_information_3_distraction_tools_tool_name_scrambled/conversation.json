There might be multiple upcoming reminders at different times\n\nTo resolve this, could you please provide just one more detail:\n- Your current date (e.g., \"July 4th\")\n- Your city or timezone (e.g., \"New York\" or \"GMT-5\")\n- Any fragment of the reminder text\n- How far in the future it is (e.g., \"in 1 hour\")\n\nI want to help, but without this basic information, I risk deleting the wrong reminder."
