The contact might not actually exist in your address book\n2. It could be a number from a messaging app (WhatsApp, Telegram) instead of your phone contacts\n\nWould you like me to:\na) Guide you through checking third-party apps\nb) Help you block the number instead (if you're receiving unwanted calls)\nc) Assist with anything else related to this number?",
