Tap the contact when it appears\n6. Tap \"Edit\" in the top-right corner\n7. Scroll down and select \"Delete Contact\"\n8. Confirm \"Delete Contact\"\n\nIf you don't see the contact after searching:\n- The number might be saved without the country code - try searching just \"12453344098\" (without the +1)\n- It might be associated with another contact - try searching for just \"53344098\" or similar partial matches\n\nWould you like me to clarify any of these steps?

The contact might not actually exist in your address book\n2. It could be a number from a messaging app (WhatsApp, Telegram) instead of your phone contacts\n\nWould you like me to:\na) Guide you through checking third-party apps\nb) Help you block the number instead (if you're receiving unwanted calls)\nc) Assist with anything else related to this number?"

Tap the â“˜ icon next to the entry\n5. Scroll down and select **Block this Caller**\n6. Confirm **Block Contact**\n\n**Block on Android (Stock):**\n1. Open your **Phone** app\n2.

Check **Block** and confirm\n\n**If you can't find it in call history:**\n*iPhone:*\n- Go to **Settings** â†’ **Phone** â†’ **Blocked Contacts** â†’ **Add New** â†’ enter \"+12453344098\"\n\n*Android:*\n- Open **Phone** app â†’ Tap 3-dot menu â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Blocked numbers** â†’ **Add a number** â†’ enter \"+12453344098\"\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Blocking prevents future communication but won't remove existing messages/call logs\n2. The number won't know it's blocked (calls go straight to voicemail, texts aren't delivered)\n3.
