Determine the exact date of \"this Friday\"\n2. Find coordinates for your location\n3. Guide you on how to check the forecast yourself using that information\n\nWould you like to provide either piece of information?"

Using a weather app on your phone (most automatically detect location)\n2. Visiting a weather website like:\n   - Weather.com\n   - AccuWeather.com\n   - The weather service for your country (e.g., weather.gov for US)\n\nThese services will automatically use your current location and show you the forecast for the upcoming days, including Friday's expected temperatures.\n\nStay warm (or cool!) and have a great week! ðŸ˜Š"
