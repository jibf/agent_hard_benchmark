Since I can only remove contacts by their unique **person_id** and don't have a way to search contacts by phone number with the current tools, here's what we can do:\n\n1. **Alternative approach**: If you have access to your full contact list, you could:\n   - Search for \"+12453344098\" in your contacts to find the associated name\n   - Share that name with me, and I can remove it\n\n2. **Future solution**: I can create a new feature for you:\n   ```python\n   def remove_contact_by_phone(phone_number):\n       # This would search all contacts and remove matches\n       # Requires implementation\n   ```\n   Would you like me to develop this capability?\n\n3. **Manual removal**: If this is urgent, you can remove it directly through your device's contact manager while I work on adding phone-based removal to my features.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?"
