Their **full name** (to match against your contacts list)\n3. **Additional details** like email or relationship notes\n\nSince we only have the phone number and no other details, I can't safely remove the contact right now. Here's what I suggest:\n\n1. You could check your contacts app to:\n   - Confirm the name attached to +12453344098\n   - See if there are multiple entries for this number\n2. If you remember any context about this person (like where you met them), that might help identify them\n3. I can help you block the number if you'd prefer not to receive calls/messages from them\n\nWould any of these alternatives be helpful?"
