I'll be right here when you're ready. üòä\n\nWhile you're working on it, here's a quick tip: The coordinates usually look like two numbers separated by a comma (e.g., **40.7128, -74.0060** for New York). The first number is latitude (north/south position), and the second is longitude (east/west position).\n\nWhenever you're ready, just paste those two numbers here and I'll decode your location for you! Good luck! üó∫Ô∏è"
