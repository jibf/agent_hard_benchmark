If you can recall the **name** associated with this number, I can remove them immediately\n2. If you have access to your contacts list elsewhere, you could find either their name or contact ID\n3. If this is a recent addition, I might be able to cross-reference if you've mentioned this person before in our conversation\n\nWould any of these alternatives work for you? I want to make sure we get this resolved!"
