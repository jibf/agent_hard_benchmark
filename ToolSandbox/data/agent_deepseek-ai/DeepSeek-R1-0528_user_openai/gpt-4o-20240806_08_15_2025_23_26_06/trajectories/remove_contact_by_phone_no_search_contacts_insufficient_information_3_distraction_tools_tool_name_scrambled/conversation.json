The removal function specifically requires the `person_id`\n\nTo resolve this, could you provide either:\n- The contact's name associated with this number\n- Or any other identifying details about the contact?\n\nAlternatively, if you have access to your contacts list, you'd need to find the specific ID assigned to this contact in your system.

Multiple contacts could potentially share the same phone number\n\nTo resolve this, you'd need to either:\n- Provide the contact's name or other identifier\n- Access your contacts through your device's interface to find the specific ID\n- Use a different method to remove the contact (like your phone's contact manager)\n\nI apologize I can't complete this request with the current information.
