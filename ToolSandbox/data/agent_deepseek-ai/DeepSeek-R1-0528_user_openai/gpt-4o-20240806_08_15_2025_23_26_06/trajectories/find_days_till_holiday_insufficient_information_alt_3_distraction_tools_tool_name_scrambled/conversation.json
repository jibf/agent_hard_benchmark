You can calculate manually:\n   - If you know today's date, count the days between now and December 25\n   - In the Northern Hemisphere, Christmas falls during winter (summer in the Southern Hemisphere)\n\nIf you can share your approximate location (e.g., \"I'm in Europe\" or \"It's summer here\"), I might be able to give seasonal context! Or if you have access to a calendar, just check how many days are left in December after today's date. ðŸŽ„"
