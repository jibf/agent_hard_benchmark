If you can't find it, swipe down on your home screen and type \"Weather\" in the search bar.\n\n2. **View the Forecast**  \n   Once opened:\n   - Your current location's weather appears first\n   - Scroll horizontally to see the hourly forecast\n   - Scroll vertically to see the 10-day forecast\n\n3. **Check Friday's Temperature**  \n   Find this Friday in the list. You'll see:\n   - High temperature (top number)\n   - Low temperature (bottom number) - this tells you how cold it will get\n\n**Alternative methods if you prefer:**\n- Ask Siri: \"Hey Siri, what's the low temperature this Friday?\"\n- Check in Apple Maps: Type your location > tap the weather button in bottom-left\n- View in Calendar: Create a dummy event for Friday and it may show weather\n\nWould you like me to clarify any of these steps?"
