The `remove_contact` function requires a unique `person_id` (not a phone number)\n2. I don't have access to search contacts by phone number\n3. Multiple contacts could share the same phone number\n\nTo help you, could you:\n- Provide the contact's name?\n- Or tell me if this is your own number (so I can search for the \"self\" contact)?\n\nAlternatively, I can guide you through finding the contact ID if you have access to your contacts list."

    "content": "I understand the challenge. Unfortunately, with the current tools available to me, I **can't directly search contacts by phone number** to find the `person_id`. Here's why and what you can do:\n\n1. **Tool limitation**:  \n   The contact management tools only allow:\n   - Adding contacts (requires name + phone)\n   - Modifying contacts (requires `person_id`)\n   - Removing contacts (requires `person_id`)\n   - *No search function exists to find contacts by phone number*\n\n2. **Practical workaround**:  \n   To resolve this:\n   - Open your device's Contacts app\n   - Search for `+12453344098` in your contacts list\n   - The contact entry will show the **name** associated with this number\n   - Once you have the name, I can help remove it\n\n3. **Alternative solution**:  \n   If this is your own number:\n   ```python\n   remove_contact(\n     person_id=\"self_contact_id\"  # I'd use a special ID if you confirm it's your number\n   )\n   ```\n\nWould you like to:\n- Provide the contact name now that you've looked it up?\n- Confirm if this is your own number?\n- Or would you prefer guidance for manual removal through your phone's OS?"

Scroll down and tap **Delete Contact**\n8. Confirm deletion\n\n### For Android:\n1. Open the **Contacts** app\n2. Tap the search magnifying glass\n3. Enter the phone number: `+12453344098`\n4. Long-press on the contact that appears\n5. Tap **Delete** (trash can icon)\n6. Confirm deletion\n\n### If you can't find it:\n1. The number might be saved under a different entry\n2. Try searching just the last 4 digits (`4098`) in your contacts\n3. Check your blocked numbers list (Settings > Phone > Blocked Contacts on iOS, or Settings > Blocked numbers on Android)\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification on any step!"
