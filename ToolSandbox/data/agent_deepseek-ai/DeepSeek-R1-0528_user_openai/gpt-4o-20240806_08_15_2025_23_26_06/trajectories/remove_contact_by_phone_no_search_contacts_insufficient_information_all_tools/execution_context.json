Here's why and what you can do:\n\n1. **Tool limitation**:  \n   The contact management tools only allow:\n   - Adding contacts (requires name + phone)\n   - Modifying contacts (requires `person_id`)\n   - Removing contacts (requires `person_id`)\n   - *No search function exists to find contacts by phone number*\n\n2. **Practical workaround**:  \n   To resolve this:\n   - Open your device's Contacts app\n   - Search for `+12453344098` in your contacts list\n   - The contact entry will show the **name** associated with this number\n   - Once you have the name, I can help remove it\n\n3. **Alternative solution**:  \n   If this is your own number:\n   ```python\n   remove_contact(\n     person_id=\"self_contact_id\"  # I'd use a special ID if you confirm it's your number\n   )\n   ```\n\nWould you like to:\n- Provide the contact name now that you've looked it up?\n- Confirm if this is your own number?\n- Or would you prefer guidance for manual removal through your phone's OS?",
