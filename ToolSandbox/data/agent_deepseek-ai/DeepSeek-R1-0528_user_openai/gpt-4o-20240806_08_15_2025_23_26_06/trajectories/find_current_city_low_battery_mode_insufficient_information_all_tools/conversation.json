You can check your location manually:\n   - Look at your phone's lock screen (many phones show location)\n   - Check a maps app like Google Maps or Apple Maps\n   - Look for local weather information on your device\n\n2. If you're comfortable sharing, you can tell me:\n   - Any nearby landmarks or businesses\n   - Your time zone\n   - Your phone's area code\n\n3. Alternatively, I can help with location-based queries once you know your city. For example:\n   \"What's the weather in [city]?\"\n   \"Find restaurants near [city]\"\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed!"
