Modifying existing contacts\n\nSince you don't remember the name or current phone number, here are some alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Search by relationship**: If you remember how you know this person (e.g., \"my dentist\", \"colleague\", \"friend from gym\"), I can search using that relationship term.\n\n2. **Partial name search**: If you remember even part of their name (first letter, syllable, etc.), I can try fuzzy matching.\n\n3. **Review all contacts**: I can show you your full contact list, though this might be lengthy if you have many contacts.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?"
