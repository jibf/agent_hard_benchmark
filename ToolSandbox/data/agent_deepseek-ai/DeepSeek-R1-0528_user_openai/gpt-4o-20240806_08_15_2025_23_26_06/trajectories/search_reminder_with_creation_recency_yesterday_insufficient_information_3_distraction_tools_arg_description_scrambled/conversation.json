For example:\n- \"Search for reminders containing 'meeting' or 'grocery'\"\n\n### Option 2: Approximate time help\nCould you provide any of these?\n- \"Right now it's morning/afternoon/evening here\"\n- \"Today is [day of week] like Monday/Tuesday\"\n- \"Yesterday was [date] like October 5th\"\n\n### Option 3: Check all recent reminders\nI can show your most recent reminders regardless of time (if you have fewer than 5).\n\nWhat would you like to try?"
