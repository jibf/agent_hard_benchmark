I have no way to determine the current date/time from my side\n\nThat said, I can try one approach: I'll search **all your reminders without any filters** and then we can manually look for ones that might have been created around the time you think was \"yesterday.\" Would you like me to retrieve your full reminder list? \n\n⚠️ Note: This might return many results if you have lots of reminders.
