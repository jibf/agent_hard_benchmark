Unfortunately, I need to clarify my limitations:\n\n1. **No current date/time access**: I don't have built-in access to the current date/time, and none of my tools can retrieve it. The datetime functions I have only convert between timestamps and calendar dates - they can't fetch the actual current time.\n\n2. **No location services**: I can't determine your location automatically. The `search_lat_lon` tool only works if you already have coordinates to convert to an address.\n\n3. **No weather data**: Even if I had your location and the date, I don't have access to weather forecasts or historical temperature data.\n\nTo help with your original question about Friday's temperature, I'd need:\n- The current date and time (so I can calculate when \"this Friday\" is)\n- Your location (city or coordinates)\n- Access to a weather API (which I don't have)\n\nWould you like help with something else that uses my actual capabilities?
