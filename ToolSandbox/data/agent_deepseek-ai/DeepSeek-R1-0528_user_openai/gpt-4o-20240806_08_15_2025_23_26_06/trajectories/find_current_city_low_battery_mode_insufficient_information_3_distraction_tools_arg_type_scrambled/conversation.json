If it shows \"Current Location,\" tap it to see the city name\n\n**For Android:**\n1. Open the Google app or Google Weather\n2. At the top, it should say \"Weather in [Your City]\"\n3. If it only shows \"Current Location,\" tap the location icon to refresh\n\n**If you don't see a specific city name:**\n1. Look at the current temperature display\n2. Check the hourly forecast for sunrise/sunset times\n3. Note any weather alerts (they often mention regions)\n4. See if there are location-specific details like \"feels like\" temperature or humidity\n\nOnce you have any of this information, share it with me and I'll help you determine your city! For example, if your weather app shows \"72¬∞F and partly cloudy,\" that could help narrow down possible locations."
