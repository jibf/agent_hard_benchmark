What apps have permission?\n\n2. **Alternative location clues**:\n   - Are you connected to WiFi? I can check that status\n   - Do you see any street signs, business names, or landmarks?\n   - What timezone are you in? (Check your phone settings)\n\n3. **Manual workaround**:\n   - Open Google Maps - it usually shows your location as a blue dot\n   - Or visit [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com) for approximate location\n\nWhich option would you like to try first?
