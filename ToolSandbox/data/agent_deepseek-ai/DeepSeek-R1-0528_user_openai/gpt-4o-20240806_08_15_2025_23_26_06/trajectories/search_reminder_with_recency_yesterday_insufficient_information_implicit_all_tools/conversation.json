Just swipe down (on phones) or look at the clock area (on computers) - it usually shows the date.\n\n2. **Alternative approach**: I can show you reminders from the past 2 days so you can look for yesterday's items. Would you like me to:\n   - Search reminders from the last 48 hours?\n   - Or list your most recent reminders?\n\nLet me know which option works better for you!"
