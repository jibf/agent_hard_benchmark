Today's date and current time\n2. What the reminder is about (or its ID if possible)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can:\n1. Calculate the exact timestamp for tomorrow at 5PM\n2. Find your specific reminder\n3. Reschedule it for you"

Potentially cause you to miss an important notification\n\nWhen you have more information available, I'd be happy to help you reschedule your reminder. Just let me know:\n- What the reminder is about\n- Your current date/time\n- Any other details about the reminder\n\nI'm here when you're ready!"
