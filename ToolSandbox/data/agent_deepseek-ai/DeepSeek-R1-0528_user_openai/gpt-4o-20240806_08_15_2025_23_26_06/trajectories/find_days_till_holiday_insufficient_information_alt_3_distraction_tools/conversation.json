You can provide approximate details (e.g., \"It's mid-December 2023\" or \"Today is October 15, 2023 around 2 PM\")\n2. I can show you the *method* to calculate it if you get the current date later:\n   - Christmas is always December 25\n   - Use: `timestamp_diff(current_timestamp, christmas_timestamp)`\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate the calculation with an example date?

Since I don't have access to real-time data and can't determine the current date/time myself, I'm unable to calculate the exact time until Christmas without that information. My tools require explicit input values to function.\n\nHowever, I can show you how the calculation would work if we had the current date. Here's the process:\n\n1. We'd need to convert today's date to a timestamp using:\n   ```python\n   datetime_info_to_timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)\n   ```\n\n2. We'd get Christmas Day (December 25) for the current year using:\n   ```python\n   search_holiday(holiday_name=\"Christmas Day\", year=current_year)\n   ```\n\n3. Then we'd calculate the difference:\n   ```python\n   timestamp_diff(today_timestamp, christmas_timestamp)\n   ```\n\nWithout knowing today's date, I can't execute these steps. If you can provide even approximate information like:\n- \"It's early November 2023\"\n- \"Today is around October 20\"\n- \"We're in December already\"\n\nI could give you an estimate. Otherwise, you might check your device's clock and provide the current date/time when convenient!"
