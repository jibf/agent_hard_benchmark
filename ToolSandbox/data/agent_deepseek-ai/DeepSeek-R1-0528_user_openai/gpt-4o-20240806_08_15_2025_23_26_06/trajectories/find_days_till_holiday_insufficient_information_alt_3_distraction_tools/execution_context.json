We'd need to convert today's date to a timestamp using:\n   ```python\n   datetime_info_to_timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)\n   ```\n\n2. We'd get Christmas Day (December 25) for the current year using:\n   ```python\n   search_holiday(holiday_name=\"Christmas Day\", year=current_year)\n   ```\n\n3. Then we'd calculate the difference:\n   ```python\n   timestamp_diff(today_timestamp, christmas_timestamp)\n   ```\n\nWithout knowing today's date, I can't execute these steps. If you can provide even approximate information like:\n- \"It's early November 2023\"\n- \"Today is around October 20\"\n- \"We're in December already\"\n\nI could give you an estimate.
