If you find a temperature in Celsius, I can convert it to Fahrenheit for you. For example:\n   \"It's 20°C at the Grand Canyon\" → I can convert that to Fahrenheit\n\n3. I can help with temperature-related calculations:\n   - Convert between Fahrenheit/Celsius\n   - Calculate temperature differences\n   - Solve problems involving temperature conversions\n\nWould you like me to help with any temperature conversions or calculations instead?"
