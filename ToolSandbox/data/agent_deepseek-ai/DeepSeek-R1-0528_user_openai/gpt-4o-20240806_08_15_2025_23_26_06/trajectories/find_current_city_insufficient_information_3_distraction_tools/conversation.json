Check your device's location services (most phones/computers show your current city in settings)\n2. Look up a nearby address or landmark you can see\n3. Use a mapping service on your device to get your location\n4. Provide me with any location details you do have (neighborhood, zip code, nearby business)\n\nIf you'd like help with something that doesn't require location information, I'm happy to assist with other topics like:\n- Stock market data\n- General knowledge questions\n- Calculations or conversions\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!"
