This might work if you don't have many reminders.\n\n2. **Best-guess time range**: If you can estimate:\n   - Approximately how many hours ago you created it\n   - Whether it was morning/afternoon/evening\n   - What day of the week it was\n\nWould you like me to show all your reminders, or can you provide any approximate timing details?"
