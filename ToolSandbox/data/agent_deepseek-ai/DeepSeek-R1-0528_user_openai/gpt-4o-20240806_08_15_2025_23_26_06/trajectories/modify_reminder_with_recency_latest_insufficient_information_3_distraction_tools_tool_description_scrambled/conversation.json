Making assumptions could reschedule the wrong reminder or set an incorrect time.\n\nTo proceed, I'd need either:\n- Details about the reminder (e.g., partial content, original time, or location)\n- Your approximate location/timezone (e.g., \"I'm in London\" or \"It's morning here now\")\n\nCould you provide one of these?
