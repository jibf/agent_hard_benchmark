Pick whichever feels easiest:\n\nOn an iPhone or iPad\n• Open the built-in Maps or Compass app.  \n  – In Maps, tap the blue dot that marks your position; a card will slide up showing the latitude and longitude.  \n  – In Compass, your current coordinates appear near the bottom of the screen.\n\n• Or swipe down for Spotlight, type “Where am I,” and tap the Maps suggestion that appears.\n\nOn an Android phone or tablet\n• Open Google Maps, tap the blue dot ➜ the coordinates appear in the search bar. Hold your finger on the coordinate string to copy it.\n\n• You can also swipe down twice for Quick Settings ➜ long-press “Location” ➜ see “Google Location Accuracy” or “Location Services.”\n\nIn any web browser (desktop or mobile)\n• Go to https://maps.google.com and click / tap the round target icon in the lower-right corner (“Show your location”). Right-click (long-press on mobile) the blue dot ➜ choose “What’s here?”; coordinates appear at the bottom.\n\n• Or just type “my location” into Google search—often it returns a map with your current city or approximate lat/long based on IP and Wi-Fi.\n\nMac or Windows\n• Apple Maps (macOS) or the Maps app (Windows 10/11) will show a blue dot you can click for details.\n\n• Command line (approximate via IP):  \n  – macOS/Linux:  curl ipinfo.io  \n  – Windows PowerShell:  Invoke-RestMethod ipinfo.io\n\nOnce you’ve copied the latitude and longitude (they look like 37.4219, -122.0840), just paste them here and I can pinpoint the city for you."
