Even that is enough for a ball-park figure.  \n\nOnce you have any of the following, I can give you an accurate or approximate distance:\n- Latitude/longitude  \n- City or town name  \n- ZIP/postal code  \n\nIf you can get any of that information, let me know and I’ll do the calculation right away."

If you can get even a rough location—city, ZIP/postal code, or, best of all, latitude/longitude—I can immediately calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge for you.\n\nQuick ways you can grab your coordinates:\n\n• On a smartphone: Open Google Maps or Apple Maps, tap the blue “my-location” dot, and look for the latitude/longitude numbers.  \n• In a desktop browser: Search “What’s my location” and allow the page to access your location—most browsers will show coordinates.  \n• On a GPS watch/fitness tracker: Check its “current coordinates” or “Where am I?” screen.  \n• Ask someone nearby (e.g., “What town or ZIP code is this?”) or look at a street sign.\n\nOnce you have any of those details, just tell me and I’ll calculate the distance right away."
