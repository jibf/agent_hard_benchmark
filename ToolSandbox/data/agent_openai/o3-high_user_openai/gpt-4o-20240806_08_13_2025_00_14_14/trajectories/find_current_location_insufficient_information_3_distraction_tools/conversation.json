On a smartphone, open a mapping app (Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.) and long-press your position to see the latitude and longitude numbers.\n2. On a laptop or desktop, search “What is my location” in a web browser; many browsers will show approximate coordinates or a city name (you may need to allow location access).\n3. Look at a recent receipt, piece of mail, or your device’s weather app—they often list the town or ZIP/postal code.\n\nOnce you have any of those details, let me know and I can look up the exact place."
