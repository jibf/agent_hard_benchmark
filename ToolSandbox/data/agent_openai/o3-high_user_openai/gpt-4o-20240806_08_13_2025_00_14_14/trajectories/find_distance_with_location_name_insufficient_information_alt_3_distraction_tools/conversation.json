Smartphone: Open Google Maps (or Apple Maps) and look at the blue-dot pin—tap it to see the coordinates.  \n2. Laptop/desktop: Go to google.com/maps and click the round target icon in the lower-right corner; a dot will appear at your position—right-click it, choose “What’s here?” and you’ll see the lat/long.  \n3. Ask someone nearby or check signage for the town/city you’re in.\n\nOnce you have even a rough idea (e.g., “I’m in Chicago”), tell me and I can work out the distance in kilometers to the Golden Gate Bridge."
