Check a real-time weather source such as weather.gov, the National Park Service app, or any weather app and note the temperature (often shown in °C by default).\n2. If it’s shown in Celsius and you’d like to convert it yourself, use the quick formula:\n    °F = (°C × 9 ⁄ 5) + 32  \n   Example: 12 °C × 9 ⁄ 5 = 21.6; 21.6 + 32 ≈ 54 °F.\n\nTypical temperature ranges at the South Rim this time of year are roughly:\n• Daytime highs: mid-40s °F to mid-50s °F  \n• Nighttime lows: teens to mid-20s °F  \n\nIf you need help converting a specific Celsius reading you find, just tell me the number and I’ll convert it for you."
