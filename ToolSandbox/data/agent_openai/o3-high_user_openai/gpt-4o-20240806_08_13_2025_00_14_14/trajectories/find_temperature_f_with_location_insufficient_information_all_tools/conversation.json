If you just need a ballpark figure or some context, here are a few useful reference points:\n\nTypical February (South Rim / Grand Canyon Village, elevation ~7,000 ft)  \n• Average daytime high: mid-40s °F (≈ 7 °C)  \n• Average nighttime low: low-20s °F (≈ -6 °C)  \n• Sudden snow showers are common, and temperatures can swing 30 °F (17 °C) in a single day.\n\nTypical February (Inner Canyon / Phantom Ranch, elevation ~2,500 ft)  \n• Average daytime high: mid-60s °F (≈ 18 °C)  \n• Average nighttime low: mid-40s °F (≈ 7 °C)\n\nIf you do need the precise current reading, the quickest low-tech options are:\n\n1. Call the Grand Canyon National Park information line (+1 928-638-7888) and follow the prompts for current South Rim weather.  \n2. Dial 511 (if you’re in Arizona) and listen to the road-condition report, which often includes temperature and snow info for the South Rim.  \n3. Use any phone capable of texting the National Weather Service’s “weather on demand” service (text a city name or ZIP—86023 for Grand Canyon Village—to  855-924-9910). They’ll text back the latest observation.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more climate statistics, packing advice, or any other information about the Canyon!"
