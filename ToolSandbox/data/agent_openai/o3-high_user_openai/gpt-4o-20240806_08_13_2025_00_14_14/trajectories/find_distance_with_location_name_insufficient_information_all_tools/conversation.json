Make sure Location Services are on (Settings ➜ Privacy & Security ➜ Location Services).  \n2. Open the built-in Compass app; your exact coordinates appear at the bottom.  \n   • Tap-and-hold the numbers to copy them.  \n3. Paste them here (e.g., “37.7749, -122.4194”).\n\nOn Android  \n1. Swipe down and long-press the “Location” icon to confirm it’s enabled.  \n2. Open Google Maps, tap the blue dot that marks “Your location,” then tap “Share location” → “Copy to clipboard” (or read the numbers shown at the top).  \n   • They’ll look like “37.7749, -122.4194.” Send those here.\n\nOn a computer  \n1. Go to Google Maps in a browser, right-click (or control-click) the spot that marks “Your location.”  \n2. Select “What’s here?”; the lat/long appears in a pop-up and in the search bar. Copy it.\n\nOnce you have your coordinates, send them to me and I’ll calculate exactly how far you are from the Golden Gate Bridge."

Make sure Location Services are ON  \n   • Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → toggle ON.  \n2. Open the Compass app (it’s in the Utilities folder by default).  \n3. Stand still for a second; the bottom of the screen will display something like  \n   37°47'38\"N  ‑122°25'11\"W  \n4. Touch-and-hold that coordinate line; you’ll see “Copy” appear. Tap Copy.  \n5. Come back here and paste it (you can simply paste the raw string, or convert to decimal if you know how—either way is fine).\n\nB) If you prefer Apple Maps (iOS 15+)  \n\n1. Open Apple Maps.  \n2. Tap the blue dot that marks “My Location.”  \n3. An info card slides up; swipe it upward to expand if needed.  \n4. You’ll see the address plus coordinates (e.g., 37.7749, -122.4194).  \n5. Touch-and-hold the coordinate text > Copy, then paste it here.\n\nEither method should take less than a minute. Once you paste the coordinates, I can immediately calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge. Let me know if you hit any snag along the way!"

If you want me to troubleshoot location-sharing on your iPhone (for instance, why you can’t copy the coordinates), just let me know where you’re getting stuck and I’ll walk you through it.\n\n3.
