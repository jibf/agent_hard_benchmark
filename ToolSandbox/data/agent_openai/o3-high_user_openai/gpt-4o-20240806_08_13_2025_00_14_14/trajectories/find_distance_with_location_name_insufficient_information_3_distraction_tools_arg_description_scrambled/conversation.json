Sites like “where-am-i.net” will show your coordinates immediately (no account needed).\n\n3. Nearby landmark, city, or ZIP code  \n   • Even something broad—“I’m in Portland, Oregon” or “ZIP 97201”—lets me give you a ballpark distance.\n\nOnce you have any of those details, just send them here and I’ll calculate how far you are from the Golden Gate Bridge."
