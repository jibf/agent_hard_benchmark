Phone or tablet  \n   • On most smartphones you can open Google Maps (or Apple Maps) and tap the blue dot that shows where you are; the latitude/longitude appears if you press and hold on the dot or swipe up on its info card.  \n   • Copy the coordinates shown (e.g., 37.7749 N, –122.4194 W).\n\n2. Laptop or desktop  \n   • Open google.com/maps, click the small “target” icon in the bottom-right corner (“Your location”).  \n   • Right-click the blue dot that appears ➜ select “What’s here?”; coordinates appear at the bottom.\n\n3. Just tell me a nearby landmark or city  \n   • If you at least know the city, neighborhood, or a well-known landmark you’re near (e.g., “downtown San Jose, CA” or “Union Square, San Francisco”), I can give an approximate distance.\n\nLet me know whichever of those you can provide, and I’ll calculate roughly how many kilometers it is to the Golden Gate Bridge."
