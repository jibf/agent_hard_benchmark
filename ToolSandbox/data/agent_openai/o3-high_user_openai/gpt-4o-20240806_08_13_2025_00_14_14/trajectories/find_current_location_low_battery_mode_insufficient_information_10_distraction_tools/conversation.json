A card at the bottom/side will show the coordinates.\n\nOnce you give me the latitude and longitude— even roughly—I can look up the street address or nearby landmarks for you."

Here are a few quick, low-effort options to get that info without hunting through apps:\n\n1. “What’s my location?” websites  \n   • On your phone or computer, open a browser and visit a site like  ‑ https://mycurrentlocation.net  ‑ https://where-am-i.org  \n   • When prompted, allow the site to use your location. It will immediately show your latitude/longitude (often also a map and address).  \n   • Copy the numbers and send them here.\n\n2. Voice assistants  \n   • Siri: Say “Hey Siri, what’s my location?” and she’ll show the address—read it to me.  \n   • Google Assistant: “Hey Google, where am I?” – same idea.\n\n3. Maps “share” shortcut  \n   • Google Maps (iOS/Android): Tap the blue dot (your location) ⇒ “Share your location” or “Save/Copy coordinates.”  \n   • Apple Maps: Tap the blue dot ⇒ drag up the info card ⇒ long-press the coordinates to copy.\n\n4. Compass / weather widgets  \n   • iOS Compass app or a weather widget often displays coordinates right under the heading or current conditions.  \n   • Android’s built-in “Emergency Location” (Settings > Location > Advanced > Emergency) shows them as well.\n\nIf none of those work, even a nearby landmark (e.g., “I’m next to the Eiffel Tower”) or cross-street can help me look up your position. Let me know what you can find, and I’ll take it from there!"

    "content": "To keep making progress I’ll need at least a hint about where you are—coordinates, an address, or even just a recognizable landmark or nearby business name. Here are several “lowest-effort” ways to get that information without digging through unfamiliar menus:\n\n1. Use a “Where am I?” web page (fast and no app installs)  \n   • Open any browser and go to one of these:  \n     – https://mycurrentlocation.net  \n     – https://where-am-i.org  \n   • When the site asks for permission, tap “Allow.”  \n   • It will instantly display your latitude/longitude and often an approximate address; copy whatever it shows and paste it here.\n\n2. Let your phone’s voice assistant tell you  \n   • iPhone: Say “Hey Siri, what’s my location?”—Siri will read an address aloud or show it on-screen.  \n   • Android: Say “Hey Google, where am I?”—Google Assistant does the same.  \n   • Just relay what it says.\n\n3. Tap-and-hold the blue dot in a maps app  \n   • Google Maps (iOS/Android): Open the app, tap the blue dot (your location), then “Share” or “Copy coordinates.”  \n   • Apple Maps: Tap the blue dot → swipe up the info card → long-press the coordinates to copy.\n\n4. Nearby landmark or intersection  \n   • Look around: street signs, building names, store fronts, or a distinctive landmark (e.g., “in front of Union Station, Washington DC”).  \n   • Tell me what you see; I can reverse-look it up.\n\n5. Ask a friend’s phone for help  \n   • If there’s another device handy, have it open its maps app, share a pin, or read out the coordinates.\n\nOnce you can give me any of the above—even if it’s only approximate—I can identify the exact location and keep assisting (give directions, find services nearby, etc.). If none of these options work and you’re in urgent need of help finding your way, consider calling a local emergency number or asking someone nearby.\n\nLet me know which option you want to try or share whatever details you can, and we’ll move forward from there."
