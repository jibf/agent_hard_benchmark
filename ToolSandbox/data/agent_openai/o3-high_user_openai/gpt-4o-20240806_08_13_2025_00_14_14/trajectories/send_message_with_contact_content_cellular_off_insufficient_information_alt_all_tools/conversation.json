(Most artists keep them confidential, and a direct phone number usually isn’t publicly available.)\n\nHere are a few practical ways you could try reaching Fredrik Thordendal or his representatives:\n\n• Official channels – Check Meshuggah’s or Fredrik’s official website and social-media pages. Artists sometimes list a management or booking-agent email address for professional inquiries.  \n• Record label – Meshuggah’s latest releases have come out via Atomic Fire Records (and previously Nuclear Blast). The label’s contact page can route messages to the band’s management.  \n• Social media – Sending a polite direct message or publicly tagging him (or the band) on Instagram, Twitter/X, or Facebook is often the most direct public route.  \n• Management/booking agencies – Search “Meshuggah management contact” or “booking agent” in case there’s a published email.  \n• Publicist – For album-release press, bands typically list a PR contact in press releases; you can sometimes find that in recent news articles.\n\nIf you do obtain a valid phone number (or another direct line), just let me know and I can send the message for you."
