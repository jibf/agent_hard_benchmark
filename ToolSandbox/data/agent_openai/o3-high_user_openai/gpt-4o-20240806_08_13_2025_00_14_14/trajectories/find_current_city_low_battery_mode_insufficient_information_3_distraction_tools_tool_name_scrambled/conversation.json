It’s quick, but it can be wrong by tens of miles in some cases.  \n   • If you’d like me to do that, just let me know and I’ll give you the result.\n\n2. Read the numbers off your phone (more precise).  \n   • iPhone: open the Compass app and note the latitude/longitude at the bottom, or drop a pin on the blue dot in Maps and copy the numbers that appear at the top.  \n   • Android: open Google Maps, tap the blue “you-are-here” dot, then swipe up on the info card—your coordinates will be shown.  \n   • Paste those two numbers here and I can tell you the city.\n\n3. Tell me a nearby landmark or address you know.  \n   • Even something like “the Space Needle” or “Times Square” is enough for me to identify the city.\n\nJust let me know which option you prefer (or if you have another idea), and we’ll go from there."
