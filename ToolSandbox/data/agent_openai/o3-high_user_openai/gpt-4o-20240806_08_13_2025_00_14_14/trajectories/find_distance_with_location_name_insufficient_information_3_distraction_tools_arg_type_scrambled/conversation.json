Here are a few quick tips for finding your current coordinates so we can finish the calculation:\n\n1. Phone or tablet  \n   • iOS / Android: Open Maps → tap the blue “you are here” dot → swipe up (iOS) or tap the info card (Android) and look for numbers like “37.7 -122.4”.  \n   • Copy those latitude/longitude values here.\n\n2. Laptop or desktop  \n   • Go to Google Maps → click the small gray circle / compass near the lower-right corner → if prompted, allow location access.  \n   • Right-click the blue dot, choose “What’s here?”; a box at the bottom will show coordinates.\n\n3. If you only know a nearby landmark, city, or ZIP code, that’s usually close enough for a rough mileage estimate.\n\nOnce you can share any of those details, I can calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge for you."
