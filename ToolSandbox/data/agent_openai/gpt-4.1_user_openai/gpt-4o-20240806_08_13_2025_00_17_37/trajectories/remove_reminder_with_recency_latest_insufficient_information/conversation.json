Open the “Reminders” app.\n     2. Browse through your lists or tap “Scheduled” to see what’s coming up next.\n   - **Android (Google Reminders or Google Assistant):**\n     1. Open the “Google” app or “Google Assistant.”\n     2. Say or type: “Show my reminders.”\n\n3. **On your computer:**\n   - **Apple Mac (Reminders app):**\n     - Open the “Reminders” app from your Applications folder.\n   - **Google Account (Google Calendar or Assistant):**\n     - Visit Google Calendar (calendar.google.com) and click on “Reminders” in the left panel, or use Google Assistant as above.\n\n4. **On other reminder/tracker apps:**\n   - Open your preferred app and look for a section labeled “Upcoming,” “Scheduled,” or similar.\n\nOnce you’ve found your reminders, let me know which one you’d like to remove by sharing its content or scheduled time, and I can help further! Need specific instructions for a different device or app? Just let me know which one you use."
