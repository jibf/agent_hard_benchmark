A pin will drop, and you should see the coordinates (numbers like 37.4219, -122.0840) either at the top or bottom of the screen.\n4. Copy those numbers and share them here.\n\nComputer (Web Browser):\n\n1. Go to Google Maps (maps.google.com).\n2. Click the “My Location” button (looks like a target/crosshair, usually bottom right).\n3. Right-click on the blue dot or your position and select “What’s here?”\n4. The coordinates will appear at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIf you’re having trouble, just let me know what device you’re using and I’ll provide more specific step-by-step instructions!"
