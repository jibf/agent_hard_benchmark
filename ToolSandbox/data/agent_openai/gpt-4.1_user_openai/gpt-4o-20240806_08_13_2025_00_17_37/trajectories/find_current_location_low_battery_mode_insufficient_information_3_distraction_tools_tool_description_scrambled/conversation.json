Open the Compass app (it’s installed by default on most iPhones).\n2. Your current coordinates (latitude and longitude) will be shown at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOption 3: Using Google Maps\n1. Open Google Maps.\n2. Tap the blue dot (your current location).\n3. A pop-up will appear at the bottom; swipe up to see your coordinates.\n\nOnce you have your latitude and longitude, just tell me the numbers, and I’ll help identify your location! If you have any trouble, let me know where you’re getting stuck, and I can help further."

On your iPhone, swipe down on the home screen and type “Compass” into the search bar, then open the Compass app.\n2. At the bottom of the Compass screen, you should see two numbers labeled as latitude (N/S) and longitude (E/W). They might look something like: 37.7739° N, 122.4312° W.\n\nIf you still don’t see it, your iPhone might need location services enabled for the Compass app:\n\nHere’s how to check:\n1. Open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services.\n2. Make sure “Location Services” is turned ON.\n3. Scroll down and tap Compass, then select “While Using the App.”\n\nOnce the Compass app displays your coordinates, you can share them here and I’ll help you identify your exact location.\n\nIf you prefer, I can guide you through a different method or help with screenshots—just let me know what’s easiest for you!"
