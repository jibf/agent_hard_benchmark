Grant your browser permission to access Location  \n   (Instructions below assume you’re using Chrome; other browsers are similar.)  \n   a. Open Chrome.  \n   b. Tap the three-dot menu (⋮) in the upper-right corner and choose “Settings.”  \n   c. Scroll down and tap “Site settings.”  \n   d. Tap “Location.”  \n   e. Make sure “Ask first (recommended)” is enabled.  \n   f. If you see this site listed under “Blocked,” tap it and switch to “Allow.”\n\n3. Share your location with this chat  \n   a. Go back to this page in Chrome.  \n   b. Reload the page.  \n   c.
