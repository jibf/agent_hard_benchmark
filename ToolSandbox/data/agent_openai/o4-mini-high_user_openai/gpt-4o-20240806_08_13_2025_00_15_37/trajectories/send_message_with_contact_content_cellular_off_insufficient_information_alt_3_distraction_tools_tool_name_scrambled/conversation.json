Band Management / Booking Agent  \n   • Email: office@meshuggah.net  \n   • (If that bounces, you can also try booking inquiries via their booking agency—DDM Agency in Stockholm: booking@ddmagency.com.)\n\n3. Record Label  \n   Meshuggah releases are on Nuclear Blast. You can address an email to their press/PR department and ask to be forwarded to Fredrik’s team:  \n   • info@nuclearblast.de\n\n4. Social Media  \n   Fredrik is somewhat active on Instagram and Facebook. You could send a polite direct message:  \n   • Instagram: @fthordendalofficial  \n   • Facebook: fb.com/fredrikthordendal  \n\n5. LinkedIn / Professional Networks  \n   If you have a LinkedIn Premium account, you may be able to find his management or booking agent and reach out directly there.\n\nPick whichever channel you prefer, and I can help you draft the exact message once you’ve decided. Let me know!"

I’ve been following your work with Meshuggah for years and can’t wait to hear the next album. How is the writing/recording process coming along? Any sneak-peek stories or sounds you’d care to share?\n\nThanks for all the inspiration—and for taking the time to read this!  \nCheers,  \n[Your Name]"
