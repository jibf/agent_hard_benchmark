Open your Settings app (the gear icon).  \n   2. Tap “Location.”  \n   3. Make sure the toggle at the top (“Use location”) is set to ON.  \n\n2. Give this app permission to access Location  \n   Method A: If you’re using the ChatGPT/companion app  \n   1. In Settings, tap “Apps & notifications” (or just “Apps”).  \n   2. Tap “See all apps,” then scroll to and select “ChatGPT” (or whatever this app is called).  \n   3. Tap “Permissions.”  \n   4. Tap “Location” and choose “Allow only while using the app” (or “Allow all the time” if you prefer).\n\n   Method B: If you’re using ChatGPT in a mobile browser (e.g. Chrome)  \n   1. Open Chrome, tap the three-dot menu ⋮ → “Settings.”  \n   2. Tap “Site settings” → “Location.”  \n   3. Under “Allowed,” make sure chat.openai.com (or the site you’re on) is listed.  \n   4. If it’s under “Blocked,” tap it and switch to “Allow.”\n\n3. Share your location  \n   • Return to this chat. Your browser/app should now prompt you to share your location.  \n   • When prompted, choose “Allow.”  \n\nOnce you tap “Allow,” I’ll be able to get your latitude/longitude and look up your address. Let me know if you hit any snags!"
