Smartphone (iOS or Android)  \n   • Open your map app (Apple Maps or Google Maps).  \n   • Tap or long-press the “blue dot” that marks your location.  \n   • You should see your latitude and longitude—copy or note them down.\n\n2. Web browser  \n   • Go to a site like https://www.latlong.net/ or https://www.gps-coordinates.net/.  \n   • Click the “Get GPS Coordinates” button or allow location access.  \n   • It will display your current lat/lon.\n\n3. IP-based lookup  \n   • Visit https://whatismyipaddress.com/ or https://iplocation.net/.  \n   • It will give an approximate city/region based on your IP.\n\nOnce you have any of the above—GPS coordinates, a street name or ZIP code, or even the city you got from an IP lookup—just drop that info here and I’ll identify your city right away."
