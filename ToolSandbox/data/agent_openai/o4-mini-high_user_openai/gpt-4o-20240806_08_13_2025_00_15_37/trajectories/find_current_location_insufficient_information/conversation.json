Drop a pin in a mapping app:  \n   - In Google Maps or Apple Maps, long-press on the map to drop a pin, then read off the coordinates or address that appears.\n\n3. Check an IP-based “What’s my location?” website:  \n   - From a browser, visit a site like ipinfo.io or whatismyipaddress.com to see an approximate city or region.\n\n4. Look around for any landmark, business name, street sign, intersection, or building number and let me know.\n\nIf none of those are possible right now, I won’t be able to determine “where you are.” Whenever you’re able to share at least one of the above, just let me know and I’ll help you identify your location."
