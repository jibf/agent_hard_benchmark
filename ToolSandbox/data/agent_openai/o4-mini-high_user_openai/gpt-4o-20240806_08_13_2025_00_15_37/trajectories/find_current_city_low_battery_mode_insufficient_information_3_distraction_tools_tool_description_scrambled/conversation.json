On iPhone  \n   a. Open the built-in Compass app (if you don’t have it, you can download one free from the App Store).  \n   b. Allow it to access your location.  \n   c. Your current latitude and longitude appear at the bottom of the screen—just tap and hold to copy.\n\n3. Or—on either device—you can long-press somewhere on the map in Google Maps (where you are) to drop a pin; the coordinates will show in the search bar at the top.\n\nOnce you’ve got the two numbers (latitude and longitude), send them over (for example “37.42, –122.08”), and I’ll tell you which city you’re in."

Open a map app to read your coordinates  \n   • Google Maps (iOS or Android):  \n     – Launch Google Maps and wait for the blue dot to appear where you are.  \n     – Tap and hold that blue dot to drop a pin.  \n     – The latitude and longitude will show up in the search bar or at the bottom.  \n     – Tap the coordinates to copy them.\n\n3.
