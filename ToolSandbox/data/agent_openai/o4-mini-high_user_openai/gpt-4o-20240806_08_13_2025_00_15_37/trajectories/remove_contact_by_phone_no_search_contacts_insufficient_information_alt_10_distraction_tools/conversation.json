Tap the “Share Contact” option and choose to export a vCard.  \n   3. In the resulting .vcf file look for a line starting with “UID:” — that’s the person_id.  \n\n • On Android:  \n   1. Open Contacts and tap the contact.  \n   2. Tap the three-dot menu → “Share” → “Contacts via .vcf.”  \n   3. Open that .vcf file and find the “UID:” field for the person_id.  \n\nOnce you have the person_id, let me know and I can remove that contact for you."
