In a web browser  \n   – When prompted by this site to “allow location,” click “Allow.”  \n   – If you missed the prompt, click the padlock (🔒) icon in your address bar, find “Location,” and set it to “Allow.”\n\nOnce you have your latitude & longitude (or even just a nearby street address or zip code), send it over and I’ll look up which city you’re in."

Once you have even a rough clue—an IP-based location, a description of your surroundings, a time zone offset, etc.—I can help you turn that into a city name.\n\n1. Use an IP-based geolocation site  \n   • In your browser, Google “what’s my IP” and note the address you get.  \n   • Go to a free IP-lookup site (e.g. iplocation.net, whatismyipaddress.com) and it’ll give you an approximate city.\n\n2. Ask your device’s built-in assistant  \n   • On iOS: Say “Hey Siri, where am I?”  \n   • On Android: Say “Hey Google, what’s my location?”  \n   • On Windows/Mac: In Chrome/Firefox’s address bar, type `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` in the dev console under “Sensors” (advanced).\n\n3. Check local signage or clues  \n   • Look for street-sign names, store or restaurant names, bus/train lines, license-plate codes, or postal codes on mail/boxes.  \n   • Note the language(s) on signs, currency on price-tags, mobile carrier name in your status bar, or local radio stations.\n\n4. Find your time-zone offset  \n   • What does your clock read compared to UTC? (e.g. UTC +2, UTC –5)  \n   • Combine that with hemisphere clues (weather, latitude-style sunlight) to narrow it down.\n\n5. Describe your surroundings to me  \n   • Even a few landmarks, major roads, company names, or distinctive buildings can be enough for me to make an educated guess.\n\nPick whichever method you can manage, then share the result. I’ll turn that into your city right away."
