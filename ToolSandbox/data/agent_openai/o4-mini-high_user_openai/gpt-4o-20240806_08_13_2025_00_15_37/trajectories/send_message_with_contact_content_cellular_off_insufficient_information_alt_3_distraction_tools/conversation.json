Visit his official website or Facebook/Instagram/Twitter pages. Many artists list a “Contact,” “Management,” or “Press” email there.  \n2. Check his record label’s website (e.g. Nuclear Blast, if that’s who he’s signed to) for an artist-relations or press contact.  \n3. Look for a fan club or street team site—they often share official management or booking addresses.  \n4. If you find an email address or social-media handle, let me know and I can draft or send your message right away.  \n\nWhich of these would you like help with? Or is there another route you’d prefer?"
