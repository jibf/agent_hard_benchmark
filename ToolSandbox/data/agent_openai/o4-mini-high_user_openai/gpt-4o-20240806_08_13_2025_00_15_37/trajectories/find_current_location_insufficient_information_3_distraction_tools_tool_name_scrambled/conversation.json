Scroll to your browser or this app and set Location Access to “While Using” or “Always”  \n  4. Return here and your browser/app should prompt you to share your coordinates—just allow it and paste them.  \n\n• Android (Chrome or app):  \n  1. Open Settings → Location → switch it ON  \n  2. In Chrome: Settings → Site settings → Location → ensure this site is allowed  \n  3. Return here, accept the browser/app location prompt, and paste the latitude/longitude you get.  \n\nOn desktop  \n• In Chrome/Edge/Firefox:  \n  1. Click the lock icon in the address bar → Site settings (or Permissions) → Location → set to “Allow”  \n  2. Reload this page—your browser will ask permission to share your location.  \n\nOnce you’ve done that, copy the latitude and longitude you see (or just allow the prompt and paste here) and I can look up your address."
