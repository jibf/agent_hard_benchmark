    "content": "Temperatures in Grand Canyon vary dramatically by elevation and season, but here’s a very rough “ballpark” in °F for the most-visited South Rim and the inner canyon (e.g. Phantom Ranch area):\n\n1. Summer (June–August)  \n   - South Rim (≈7,000 ft): Highs 70–85 °F, lows 45–60 °F  \n   - Inner Gorge (≈2,400 ft): Highs 100–115 °F, lows 70–80 °F  \n\n2. Shoulder Seasons (April–May & September–October)  \n   - South Rim: Highs 50–70 °F, lows 30–45 °F  \n   - Inner Gorge: Highs 80–95 °F, lows 50–65 °F  \n\n3. Winter (November–March)  \n   - South Rim: Highs 35–50 °F, lows 15–30 °F (snow is common up top)  \n   - Inner Gorge: Highs 50–60 °F, lows 30–40 °F  \n\nIf you just want a “current” snapshot, park webcams and most weather sites quote South Rim temps—so right now you’d usually see something between 40 °F (pre-dawn) and 75 °F (afternoon) in summer, dip lower in winter. But keep in mind that even in mid-summer a quick hike down can expose you to 30–40 °F warmer air as you descend."
