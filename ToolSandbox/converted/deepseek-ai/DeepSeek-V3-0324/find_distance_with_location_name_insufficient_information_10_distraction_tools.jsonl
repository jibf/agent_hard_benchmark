For example:\n     - \"How far is downtown San Francisco from the Golden Gate Bridge?\"\n     - \"What's the distance between Oakland and the Golden Gate Bridge?\"\n\n### 2. **Describe Your General Location**\n   - If you're comfortable sharing a general area (e.g., \"I'm in Berkeley\" or \"I'm near Union Square\"), I can use that to estimate the distance.\n\n### 3. **Check Your Device Settings**\n   - Sometimes, location services might be turned off. Here's how to check:\n     - **iPhone:** Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Ensure it's turned on for Maps.\n     - **Android:** Go to Settings > Location > Ensure it's turned on.\n\nLet me know which option works best for you!", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's really acting up, and I can't get an estimate.
