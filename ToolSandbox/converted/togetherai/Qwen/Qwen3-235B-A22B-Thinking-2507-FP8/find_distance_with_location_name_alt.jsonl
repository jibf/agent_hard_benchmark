The user didn't specify where they're starting from, so I should assume they mean from their current location. But wait, the system might not know their current location unless I get it.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's a function called get_current_location that doesn't require any parameters. So I should call that first to get the user's current latitude and longitude.\n\nOnce I have the current location, I need to find the latitude and longitude of the Golden Gate Bridge. The user mentioned the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a specific location. To get its coordinates, I can use the search_location_around_lat_lon function. But wait, the search function requires a location string. The location parameter here would be \"Golden Gate Bridge\". However, the search function also needs latitude and longitude to search around, but if I don't have them yet, maybe I can first get the current location, then use that to search for the Golden Gate Bridge? Wait, no. Wait, the search_location_around_lat_lon function's description says that if latitude and longitude aren't provided, it defaults to the current location. But actually, the required parameter is only \"location\". Wait, looking back: the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon have \"location\" as required, and latitude/longitude are optional, defaulting to current if not provided. But to search for the Golden Gate Bridge, maybe I don't need to specify latitude/longitude because I just want to find where the Golden Gate Bridge is. Wait, but the function is for searching around a specific lat/lon. Hmm.\n\nWait, the description says: \"Search for a location around a latitude and longitude location is a surface form query defining the location. This can be a business name like McDonald's, a point of interest like restaurant, a city / state, or a full address. When latitude and longitude are not provided, defaults to search around current location.\"\n\nWait, so if I want to find the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates, I need to search for it. But the search is around a given lat/lon. However, if I don't have a specific lat/lon, maybe I can first get the current location, then use that to search? But that doesn't make sense because the current location is where the user is, and the Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco. Wait, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used to find the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates regardless of the current location. Wait, but the function's purpose is to search around a specific lat/lon. So if I want to find the Golden Gate Bridge, maybe I need to search for it without specifying a lat/lon, but the function requires location as a parameter. Wait, the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon require \"location\" (the query string), and optionally latitude and longitude. If latitude and longitude are not provided, it uses the current location. But if I want to find the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a specific place, maybe I should call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", and without providing latitude and longitude. Wait, but the function's description says that when lat/lon are not provided, it defaults to current location. But if the current location is, say, New York, searching around there for Golden Gate Bridge might not find it. So perhaps this function isn't the right way to get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nWait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function is intended to find places near a certain point, but if you want the exact coordinates of a well-known landmark, perhaps you need to search for it without a specific lat/lon, but the function might not work that way. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is: first get the current location (lat/lon), then search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" using the current location as the center, but that might not return the actual bridge if the user is far away. Wait, but the user is asking for the distance from their current location to the Golden Gate Bridge, so the search for the bridge's location should be done independently. Wait, perhaps the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be used to find the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates by querying \"Golden Gate Bridge\" as the location, and not providing lat/lon, but the function requires lat/lon to default to current. Wait, but if the user is in a different city, the search around current location might not find the bridge. So this seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function is designed to find locations near the given lat/lon, but if you want to find a specific landmark regardless of location, you might need to have a different approach. However, given the tools provided, perhaps the intended way is: first get current location, then search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" using the current location's lat/lon as the center. But if the user is not near San Francisco, this might not return the correct result. Alternatively, maybe the search function can find the Golden Gate Bridge even if you're not near it, but the description says \"search around a latitude and longitude\", which implies it's for nearby places.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a problem. But given the tools available, perhaps the correct steps are:\n\n1. Call get_current_location to get the user's current lat/lon.\n2. Use search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", and the current lat/lon obtained from step 1. But this might not find the bridge if the user is far away. However, maybe the search function is smart enough to return the actual Golden Gate Bridge regardless of the search area, but the description doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function, when given a specific location name like \"Golden Gate Bridge\", will return its coordinates even if it's far from the provided lat/lon. But the description says \"search around a latitude and longitude\", which suggests it's for nearby places. So this is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the distance from their current location to the Golden Gate Bridge, so we need two points: current location and the bridge's location. To get the bridge's location, perhaps we need to search for it without relying on the current location. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function can be called with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without providing lat/lon, but the function requires lat/lon to default to current. But if we don't have current lat/lon yet, we need to get it first.\n\nWait, the steps should be:\n\n1. Get current location (lat0, lon0) via get_current_location.\n2. Search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" to get its lat1, lon1. But how? Because search_location_around_lat_lon requires a location string and optionally lat/lon. If we call it with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and no lat/lon, it would default to current location, but that might not find the bridge if current location is far. However, perhaps the search is global when lat/lon are not provided? The description isn't clear.\n\nWait, the parameters for search_location_around_lat_lon say that latitude and longitude are optional, defaulting to current if not provided. But to get the current location, we need to call get_current_location first. So perhaps the correct sequence is:\n\n- Call get_current_location to get current lat/lon.\n- Then call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\", and using the current lat/lon as the center. But if the user is in, say, Tokyo, this search might not return the Golden Gate Bridge. So this approach might fail.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function, when given a specific landmark name, will return it regardless of the search area. But that's not specified in the tool description.\n\nThis is a problem. The user is asking for the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a fixed location. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Get current location (lat0, lon0).\n2. Find the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge (lat1, lon1). To do this, maybe call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and without specifying lat/lon, but since the function defaults to current location, which might not help. Alternatively, maybe the function can be called without lat/lon, but the tool requires location as a parameter. Wait, the required parameter is only \"location\", so perhaps we can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location=\"Golden Gate Bridge\" and no lat/lon, which would default to current location, but that might not find the bridge. However, maybe the search is not restricted to the current area when lat/lon are not provided? The description is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function is designed to find the location globally when lat/lon are not provided, but the description says \"defaults to search around current location\", implying that it's limited to the vicinity. This is a critical ambiguity.\n\nGiven the tools provided, perhaps the intended flow is:\n\n- First, get current location.\n- Then, search for \"Golden Gate Bridge\" around that current location. But if the user is not near SF, this won't work. However, the user is probably asking because they are nearby, or the system is expected to know the bridge's coordinates regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_location_around_lat_lon function, when given a well-known landmark, will return its actual coordinates even if it's far from the provided lat/lon.
