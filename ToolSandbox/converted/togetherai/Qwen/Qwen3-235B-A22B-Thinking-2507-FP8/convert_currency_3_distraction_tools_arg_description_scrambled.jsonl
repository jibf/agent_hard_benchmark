The user asked how much 2048 USD is in CNY. I called the convert_currency function with those parameters. The response came back as 14705.152.\n\nHmm, so I need to present this answer clearly. The user probably wants the converted amount rounded to two decimal places since it's currency. Let me check the standard practice. Usually, currency conversions are shown with two decimal places, like 14705.15 CNY. But the response was 14705.152, which would round to 14705.15.\n\nWait, maybe the system expects exact value without rounding? But typically, you don't have fractions of a cent in most currencies. CNY uses yuan and jiao/fen, but in practice, transactions are in two decimal places. So rounding to two decimals makes sense.\n\nLet me confirm: 2048 USD converted to CNY is 14,705.15 CNY. I should format it with commas for thousands. Also, mention the exchange rate if possible, but the tool response didn't provide the rate, just the result. So just state the amount.\n\nDouble-check the numbers: 2048 * exchange rate = 14705.152. So the exact value is approximately 14,705.15 CNY. Yep, that's correct. Alright, time to present the answer.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is equivalent to **14,705.15 CNY** (Chinese Yuan) based on the current exchange rate. \n\n*(Note: Currency conversion results are typically rounded to two decimal places for practical use.)*", "turn_idx": 2}], "eval_result": {"score": 1.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "SINGLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 1.0, "turn_count": 3, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [17, 1.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
