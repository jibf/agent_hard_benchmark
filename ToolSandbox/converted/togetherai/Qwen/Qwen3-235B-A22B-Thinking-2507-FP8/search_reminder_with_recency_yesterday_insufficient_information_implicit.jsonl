There's search_reminder, shift_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info. \n\nThe user wants to know their todo from yesterday. That means I need to find reminders that were set for yesterday. But how do I determine yesterday's date in terms of timestamps?\n\nLet me think. The search_reminder function can take a reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. So if I can get the start and end timestamps for yesterday, I can search within that range.\n\nBut to get those timestamps, I need to calculate yesterday's date. The current time isn't provided, so maybe I need to use the current time as a reference. Wait, but the user didn't specify a time zone. Hmm, but maybe the system assumes UTC or the user's local time. However, since the user didn't specify, I might have to proceed with the assumption that we're using the current time in the system's context.\n\nWait, but the problem is that I don't have the current timestamp. Oh, but maybe the functions can help. Wait, no. The shift_timestamp function can shift a timestamp by deltas, but I need a starting timestamp. Wait, perhaps I need to get the current time first. But how?\n\nWait, the user is asking about yesterday, so I need to find the timestamp range for yesterday. Let's say today is October 26, 2023. Then yesterday would be October 25, 2023. But without knowing the current date, how can I compute that?\n\nWait, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the reference. But since I don't have access to the current time, perhaps I need to use the shift_timestamp function with some assumed current time. Wait, but the user hasn't provided any timestamp. This is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant is supposed to generate a tool call that uses the current time implicitly. But since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, perhaps the shift_timestamp function is meant to be used with a timestamp that's derived from another source.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, but since there's no function for that, maybe the system expects that the current time is known. Wait, but in reality, the assistant would have access to the current time, but in this simulated scenario, maybe we need to use the shift_timestamp function to calculate yesterday's timestamp based on the current time.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think step by step.\n\n1. To find reminders for yesterday, I need the start and end timestamps of yesterday.\n2. To get those, I need to know today's date, then subtract one day to get yesterday, then get the start (00:00:00) and end (23:59:59) of that day.\n3. But to compute that, I need the current timestamp. However, the user hasn't provided it, so perhaps the assistant is supposed to assume that the current timestamp is available through some means, but in this case, the tools don't have a function to get the current time.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp as input. So maybe the assistant is supposed to use the current time as the timestamp, but since it's not provided, perhaps the system expects the assistant to generate a tool call that shifts a hypothetical current timestamp.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the tools.\n\nThe shift_timestamp function takes a timestamp and shifts it by weeks, days, etc. But to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant is supposed to know it, but in this context, since it's a simulation, maybe the assistant should generate a call that uses the current time as a timestamp. However, without knowing the actual current time, how can we proceed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's question implies that \"yesterday\" refers to the day before the current day, so the assistant needs to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday. To do that, it would need to:\n\n- Get the current timestamp (but there's no function for that)\n- Subtract one day to get yesterday's date\n- Then set the lower bound as the start of yesterday (midnight) and upper bound as the end of yesterday (23:59:59)\n\nBut since there's no function to get the current time, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the shift_timestamp function in a way that assumes the current time is known. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant should first call timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get the date components, but again, without the current timestamp, this is impossible.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The user is asking about yesterday, but without a reference timestamp, I can't compute the exact POSIX timestamps for yesterday's start and end.\n\nWait, but maybe the system expects that the assistant uses the current time as the basis. In real-world scenarios, the assistant would have access to the current time. So perhaps in this case, even though it's not provided, the assistant is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the current timestamp is available.\n\nWait, but how to represent that in the tool call? The shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp parameter. So perhaps the assistant needs to first get the current timestamp, but since there's no function for that, maybe the assistant is supposed to use a placeholder or assume that the current timestamp is known.\n\nWait, this is a bit of a dead end. Let's think differently. Maybe the user's \"yesterday\" refers to 24 hours ago from now. So instead of calendar day, it's the last 24 hours. But the user said \"yesterday,\" which usually refers to the previous calendar day.\n\nBut without knowing the current time, it's hard to define the exact range. However, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to calculate the start and end of yesterday.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Assume the current timestamp is T (even though it's not provided, but in practice, the system would know it).\n2. To get the start of yesterday (midnight), you'd take today's date at 00:00:00, subtract one day.\n3. But to compute that, you need to know today's date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should generate a tool call to shift the current timestamp back by one day to get a reference point, but again, without the current timestamp, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the correct step is to first call timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current timestamp to get the current date, but since the current timestamp isn't provided, this isn't possible.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's look back at the tools.\n\nThe search_reminder function can take reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So if I can find the POSIX timestamps for the start and end of yesterday, I can set those as the bounds.\n\nTo compute those timestamps:\n\n- Start of yesterday: (current date - 1 day) at 00:00:00\n- End of yesterday: (current date - 1 day) at 23:59:59\n\nBut to compute these, I need the current timestamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the shift_timestamp function with a delta of -1 day from the current time. But how to get the current time?\n\nAh, maybe the system expects that the assistant uses the current time as the timestamp parameter for shift_timestamp. But since the current time isn't provided, the assistant has to assume it's available. In a real scenario, the assistant would have access to the current time, so it would use that as the timestamp.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Current timestamp is, say, 1698307200 (which is October 26, 2023 00:00:00 UTC)\n- To get yesterday's start, subtract 1 day (86400 seconds) to get 1698220800 (October 25, 00:00:00)\n- But wait, that's not correct. If current timestamp is October 26 00:00:00, then yesterday's start is October 25 00:00:00, which is current timestamp minus 86400.\n\nBut the user is asking for \"yesterday,\" which is the entire day before today. So the lower bound would be (today's date - 1 day) at 00:00:00, and upper bound would be (today's date - 1 day) at 23:59:59.\n\nBut to compute that, you need to know today's date. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T)\n2. Convert T to datetime info to find today's date\n3. Set lower bound as (today's date - 1 day) at 00:00:00\n4. Set upper bound as (today's date - 1 day) at 23:59:59\n\nBut without the current timestamp, step 1 is impossible. However, in practice, the assistant would have access to the current time, so it can proceed.\n\nGiven that, the assistant should:\n\n- Use shift_timestamp to subtract 1 day from the current timestamp to get a reference, but actually, to get the start of yesterday, you need to go back to the start of the previous day.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\n- Get the current timestamp (T)\n- Subtract 1 day to get T - 86400\n- Then, adjust to the start of", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "NO_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
