The user is asking for the lowest temperature this Friday. Hmm, I need to figure out what functions I have available to answer this. Looking at the tools provided: there's search_lat_lon, datetime_info_to_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nFirst, to get the temperature, I probably need to know the date and time for \"this Friday.\" But wait, the user didn't specify a location. The functions related to date and time can convert between datetime and timestamp, but none of the tools here actually fetch weather data. The search_lat_lon function gets an address from coordinates, but that's not helpful here since there's no location given.\n\nWait, the user didn't provide a latitude or longitude, so even if I tried to use search_lat_lon, I don't have the coordinates. Also, the other tools are for converting dates to timestamps and vice versa. But without a weather API or temperature data source, I can't retrieve the temperature. The available functions don't include anything related to weather. \n\nSo, the problem is that the user is asking for temperature information, but none of the provided tools can access that data. I should inform them that I don't have the capability to check temperatures and maybe ask for more details like location, but even then, without a weather function, I can't proceed. Let me double-check the tools again. Yep, no weather-related functions. So the correct response is to state that I can't help with that request using the available tools.\n</think>\n\nThe functions provided do not include any tools for retrieving weather or temperature data. I cannot access real-time information or forecast data to determine the lowest temperature for this Friday. To answer this question, a weather API integration would be required, which is not available in the current toolset.", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
