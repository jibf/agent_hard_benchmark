They want the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge, but distance from where? The question doesn't specify a starting point. \n\nLooking at the tools available, there's the calculate_lat_lon_distance function which requires two sets of coordinates. But without knowing the user's current location or another reference point, I can't use that. The search_lat_lon function can get an address from coordinates, but again, I don't have coordinates here.\n\nWait, maybe the user is assuming I know their location, but since I don't have access to their current location data, I can't determine that. The Golden Gate Bridge has a known location, so maybe I need to get its coordinates first. Let me check if there's a function to find the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. The search_lat_lon function takes latitude and longitude to get an address, but not the other way around. Hmm, actually, maybe the user expects me to know the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the tools provided don't include a function to search for coordinates based on a place name.\n\nWait, the tools available are search_lat_lon (which is reverse geocoding), search_stock, calculate_lat_lon_distance, and search_holiday. There's no forward geocoding tool here. So I can't get the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge using the provided tools. \n\nThe user's question is ambiguous because they didn't specify the starting point. Without a starting location, I can't calculate the distance. I should ask for clarification. Let me check if any tool can help. Since there's no function to get the bridge's coordinates, maybe I need to inform the user that I need both the starting point and the destination coordinates, but since I can't get the bridge's coordinates through the tools, perhaps the user needs to provide more details.\n\nWait, maybe the user is at a specific location, but since they didn't mention it, I can't assume. The correct step here is to request more information. The tools can't be used without the necessary parameters. So I should respond that I need the starting latitude and longitude to calculate the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge. But wait, do I even know the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge? The tools don't provide a way to look that up. So even if the user provided their location, I couldn't get the bridge's coordinates to compute the distance. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The calculate_lat_lon_distance function needs both sets of coordinates. Since I can't retrieve the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates via the available tools, I can't perform the calculation. Therefore, I need to inform the user that I don't have the necessary data to answer their question and ask for both the starting point and the destination coordinates, or clarify if they have a specific location in mind.\n\nBut the user might not know the coordinates. Maybe they expect me to know the bridge's location. However, given the tools provided, I can't look it up. So the correct action is to point out the ambiguity and ask for the starting location's coordinates or more details.\n</think>\n\nThe question \"How many km to Golden Gate Bridge?\" is ambiguous because it does not specify a starting location. To calculate the distance, I would need both the current location (latitude and longitude) and the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge. However, the tools provided do not include a function to look up the Golden Gate Bridge's coordinates directly. \n\nPlease clarify:\n1. Your current location (provide latitude and longitude), **and**\n2. Confirm you want the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge (which has approximate coordinates: 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W).\n\nWithout this information, I cannot calculate the distance.", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
