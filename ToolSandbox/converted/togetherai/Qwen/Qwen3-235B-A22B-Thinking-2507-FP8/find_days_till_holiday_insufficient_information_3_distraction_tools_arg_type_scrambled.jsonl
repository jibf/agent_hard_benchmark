The user is asking how many days until Christmas Day. First, I need to figure out what date Christmas is. Christmas Day is December 25th every year. So I need to find the next occurrence of December 25th from today's date.\n\nWait, but the current year might matter. If today is after December 25th, then Christmas would be next year. So I need to check if December 25 of the current year has already passed. If it has, then use next year's date.\n\nBut how do I get the current date? Oh, maybe the system has the current time, but since I can't assume that, perhaps I should use the search_holiday function. The search_holiday function can look up a holiday by name in the US, and it defaults to the current year if the year isn't provided. So if I call search_holiday with \"Christmas Day\" and no year, it should return the timestamp for December 25 of the current year. But wait, if today is past December 25, then the current year's Christmas has already happened, so the function might return next year's? Or does it depend on the implementation?\n\nWait, the description says \"Search for a holiday by name in the US. Canonicalize return value into corresponding POSIX timestamp.\" So maybe it returns the next occurrence of the holiday. Hmm, but the parameters say the year is optional and defaults to current year. So if I don't specify the year, it would look for the holiday in the current year. But if the current year's date has passed, then the function might not return anything? Or maybe it's designed to return the next upcoming one. Wait, the problem is that the function's behavior isn't entirely clear. The description says \"search for a holiday by name in the US\" with an optional year. So if the user doesn't specify a year, it uses the current year. So if today is December 26, 2023, then Christmas 2023 has passed, and the function would return December 25, 2023, which is in the past. But the user wants the next Christmas, which would be 2024. So maybe I need to check if the returned date is in the past and then adjust the year accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_holiday function is smart enough to return the next occurrence. But the description doesn't say that. It just says \"search for a holiday by name in the US\" with the year defaulting to current. So perhaps the correct approach is to first get the current date, then determine if December 25 of this year is in the future or past.\n\nWait, but how do I get the current date? The tools provided don't include a function to get the current timestamp. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function, but that requires a timestamp. Alternatively, perhaps the system will provide the current time implicitly when processing the functions. Wait, no. The functions are the only tools available. So maybe the search_holiday function, when called without a year, uses the current year as per the system's time. But if the current year's Christmas has passed, then the function would return a past date, and then I need to calculate the difference between now and next year's Christmas.\n\nWait, but how do I get the current timestamp? Oh, perhaps the timestamp_diff function requires two timestamps, but to get the current time, maybe I need to use another method. Wait, no. The user is asking for days until Christmas, so I need the current date and the next Christmas date.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Use search_holiday(\"Christmas Day\") to get the timestamp for December 25 of the current year.\n2. Then, get the current timestamp. But how? Wait, the tools don't have a function to get the current time. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the timestamp_diff function can be used if I have two timestamps. But to get the current time, perhaps the system expects that when you call a function that requires a timestamp, the current time is available. Wait, no. The functions provided don't include a way to get the current timestamp. So maybe the search_holiday function, when called without a year, returns the next occurrence of the holiday. But the description says the year defaults to current year, so if today is after December 25, 2023, then search_holiday(\"Christmas Day\") would return December 25, 2023, which is in the past, and then the user would need to check if that's in the past and then use 2024.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_holiday function returns the next upcoming holiday. But the description isn't clear. Let's read the function description again: \"Search for a holiday by name in the US. Canonicalize return value into corresponding POSIX timestamp.\" So it's searching for the holiday in the given year (default current year). So if the user doesn't specify a year, it's for the current year. So if today is December 26, 2023, then Christmas 2023 is past, and the function would return that date, but the user wants Christmas 2024.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\n- Call search_holiday for \"Christmas Day\" with the current year (implicit).\n- Then, check if that date is in the past. But to check that, I need the current timestamp.\n- How to get the current timestamp? Wait, maybe the system provides the current time when processing the functions. Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get the current time. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the timestamp_diff function can be used with the current time as one of the timestamps. But how do I get the current time? Maybe the system assumes that when you need the current time, you can generate it via another function. Wait, but none of the functions here provide the current time. This is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used with the current date, but how would I know the current date? The user hasn't provided it. So perhaps the system expects that when you call search_holiday without a year, it uses the current year, and then the current timestamp is available implicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that the current date is known. But according to the problem statement, we shouldn't make assumptions about values to plug into functions. So if the user's question is ambiguous, we should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user is asking \"How many days is it till Christmas Day\". Christmas Day is a fixed date, December 25. So the next occurrence is either this year's December 25 if it's not passed yet, or next year's.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Determine the next Christmas date (December 25 of current year or next year).\n2. Convert that date to a timestamp.\n3. Get the current timestamp.\n4. Calculate the difference between the two timestamps.\n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? The tools don't have a function for that. Wait, maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info function can be used with a timestamp, but without a timestamp, how?\n\nWait, perhaps the system implicitly knows the current time, and when you need the current timestamp, you can use it in the functions. But according to the tools provided, there's no function to get the current timestamp. So maybe the assistant is supposed to use the search_holiday function to get Christmas date, then use timestamp_diff between now and that date. But how to get 'now'?\n\nWait, maybe the timestamp_diff function requires two timestamps, but to get the current timestamp, perhaps the system provides it as part of the context. But the problem states: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The user is asking for days until Christmas, which requires knowing the current date. Since the tools don't provide a way to get the current timestamp, perhaps the assistant needs to use the search_holiday function to get Christmas date, and then assume that the current timestamp is available. But according to the problem statement, we can't make assumptions. Wait, but maybe the search_holiday function when called without a year will return the next occurrence. Wait, the description says the year is optional and defaults to current year. So if the current year's Christmas has passed, then the function would return a past date, but the user wants the next one. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Call search_holiday for \"Christmas Day\" with the current year.\n- Then, check if that date is in the past. To check that, we need the current timestamp.\n- But how to get the current timestamp? Maybe by using datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date, but we don't know the current date.\n\nThis is a dead end. Wait, perhaps the system expects that when you call search_holiday without a year, it returns the next upcoming holiday, even if it's in the next year. But the description says the year defaults to current year, so that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should call search_holiday for \"Christmas Day\" with the current year, then if that date is in the past, call it again for next year.\n\nBut how to determine if it's in the past without the current timestamp?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_diff function by comparing the Christmas timestamp to the current time, but again, without the current timestamp, this is impossible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the system provides the current timestamp implicitly when processing the functions.
