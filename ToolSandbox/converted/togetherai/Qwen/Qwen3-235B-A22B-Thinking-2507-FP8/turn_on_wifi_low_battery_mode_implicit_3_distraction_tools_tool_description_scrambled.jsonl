The user wants to get connected to the internet. So first, I checked the Wi-Fi status and cellular service, both were off. Then I tried to turn on Wi-Fi, but there was a PermissionError because low battery mode was on. So I checked low battery mode, which was True. Then I turned off low battery mode, which worked. After that, I tried turning on Wi-Fi again, and it succeeded.\n\nNow, the user's goal is to connect to the internet. Since Wi-Fi is now on, maybe they need to connect to a network. But wait, the tools available don't include connecting to a specific Wi-Fi network, just turning Wi-Fi on or off. The functions provided are get/set for Wi-Fi, cellular, location, and low battery. \n\nWait, the user might be connected once Wi-Fi is on, but maybe they need to check if it's connected. However, the get_wifi_status was False before, but after setting it to on, the response was None, which probably means it's now on. But does turning on Wi-Fi automatically connect to a network? Maybe not. However, the tools don't have a function to list available networks or connect to one. The user's original request is to \"get me connected to the internet,\" so maybe after enabling Wi-Fi, the next step is to ensure cellular is also on as a backup.\n\nWait, earlier when checking cellular service status, it was False. So maybe after enabling Wi-Fi, we should also check if cellular is needed. But the user might prefer Wi-Fi over cellular. Since Wi-Fi is now on, maybe that's sufficient. But the problem is, turning on Wi-Fi doesn't necessarily mean connected to a network. However, given the tools available, perhaps the assistant can only toggle the status, not handle actual network connections.\n\nWait, the user's problem was that low battery mode was preventing Wi-Fi from turning on. Now that low battery mode is off and Wi-Fi is on, the user should be able to connect. But maybe the assistant needs to confirm that Wi-Fi is now on and working. Let me check the tool responses.\n\nAfter setting low battery mode to off, the response was None, which probably means success. Then setting Wi-Fi to on again gave None, so it's now on. So the next step is to inform the user that Wi-Fi is enabled and they should be connected. But maybe the cellular service is still off. Wait, the initial get_cellular_service_status was False. Should we also turn on cellular as a backup? The user said \"get me connected to the internet,\" so if Wi-Fi is on but not connected to a network, maybe cellular is needed. But without knowing if Wi-Fi is connected, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, given the tools, the assistant can't check if Wi-Fi is connected to a network, only if the Wi-Fi service is on. So since Wi-Fi is now on, and low battery mode is off, the user should be able to connect. The assistant should probably inform the user that Wi-Fi has been enabled and they can connect to a network, and maybe check if cellular is needed. But the user's main issue was the low battery mode blocking Wi-Fi, which is resolved.\n\nSo the final answer should state that Wi-Fi is now enabled, and perhaps suggest connecting to a network. Since the tools don't allow for more detailed network connection steps, the assistant can't do more. So the conclusion is that the internet connection is possible via Wi-Fi now.\n</think>\n\nThe Wi-Fi has been successfully enabled after disabling low battery mode. You should now be able to connect to available Wi-Fi networks. If you're still having trouble connecting to the internet, you may need to select a specific network or check your cellular service (which is currently off). Would you like me to enable cellular service as a backup option?", "assistant_details": {"milestone_matches": [{"milestone_index": 2, "milestone": {"snapshot_constraints": [{"database_namespace": "SANDBOX", "snapshot_constraint": "snapshot_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": null, "target_dataframe": [{"sender": "AGENT", "recipient": "USER", "content": "Wifi has been turned on."}], "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "openai_tool_call_id": "column_one_similarity", "openai_function_name": "column_one_similarity", "conversation_active": "column_exact_match_similarity", "tool_call_exception": "column_one_similarity", "tool_trace": "column_tool_trace_exact_match_similarity", "visible_to": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "MESSAGING", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 1, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "message_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender_person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender_phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient_person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient_phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "creation_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "REMINDER", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 1, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "reminder_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "creation_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity", "reminder_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity", "latitude": "column_exact_match_similarity", "longitude": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "CONTACT", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 1, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "name": "column_exact_match_similarity", "phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "relationship": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "is_self": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}], "guardrail_database_list": ["SANDBOX", "SETTING", "CONTACT", "MESSAGING", "REMINDER"], "guardrail_database_exclusion_list": null}, "milestone_similarity": 0.20465279795044655}]}, "turn_idx": 6}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.7348842659834821, "categories": ["STATE_DEPENDENCY", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.7348842659834821, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.7348842659834821, "turn_count": 13, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [25, 1.0], "1": [27, 1.0], "2": [28, 0.20465279795044655]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
