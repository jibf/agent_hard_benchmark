Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current time isn't specified, I'll assume the user is referring to the next day at 17:00 (5 PM in 24-hour format). \n\nBut to get the exact POSIX timestamp, I might need the current time. Wait, there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give me the current time. But maybe I don't need to call it if I can calculate based on the user's input. However, without knowing the current date, I can't be sure what \"tomorrow\" is. So perhaps I should first get the current timestamp to determine tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", so if today is, say, October 10th, then tomorrow is October 11th at 17:00. To convert that to a POSIX timestamp, I need the exact date and time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the shift_timestamp function. If I get the current timestamp, then add 1 day and 5 hours (but wait, 5 PM is 17:00, so if current time is, say, 10 AM, adding 27 hours would get to tomorrow 1 PM? Hmm, maybe better to calculate the exact time for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nWait, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info to know today's date.\n3. Then set tomorrow's date at 17:00:00.\n4. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut the functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So if I can get the current date, add one day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp: take current timestamp, add 1 day (24 hours) and then adjust the time to 17:00. Wait, but if the current time is after 5 PM, adding 24 hours would get to the next day at the same time, but the user wants 5 PM tomorrow regardless of current time.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get current date and time.\n- Set the target date to tomorrow (current day +1), hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that target datetime to timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, I need to call get_current_timestamp first, then process it.\n\nWait, but the assistant can't do calculations; it has to use the provided functions. Let's check the available functions.\n\nThe functions include:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: returns current POSIX timestamp.\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts date/time components to timestamp.\n- shift_timestamp: shifts a timestamp by deltas (days, hours, etc.)\n\nSo possible steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to current timestamp. But wait, adding 1 day would get to same time tomorrow. However, the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time. So if current time is 10 AM today, adding 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: set the time to 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nSo:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current year, month, day.\n- Increment day by 1 (tomorrow).\n- Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that datetime info to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant can't perform the increment; it has to use functions. Wait, the functions available don't include adding days directly unless using shift_timestamp.\n\nWait, shift_timestamp can take days as a parameter. So if I take the current timestamp, and shift it by 1 day, but also adjust the time to 17:00. Hmm, but shift_timestamp adds/subtracts the deltas from the original timestamp.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nCurrent timestamp is, say, 1700000000 (example). If I shift by 1 day (86400 seconds), that gives me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, so if current time is 10 AM, adding 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM, which is 7 hours later. So perhaps shift by 1 day + 7 hours.\n\nBut how to calculate that? Alternatively, set the time to 5 PM of the next day.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current date.\n3. Create a new datetime for tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n4. Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut to do step 3, need to know tomorrow's date. So:\n\n- Suppose current datetime is 2023-10-10 14:30:00.\n- Tomorrow is 2023-10-11.\n- Target time is 2023-10-11 17:00:00.\n\nSo need to construct that datetime.\n\nBut how to get tomorrow's date? Using shift_timestamp with days=1, but then adjust the time.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift by 1 day to get same time tomorrow.\n- Then shift by (17 - current hour) hours, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use datetime_info_to_timestamp with tomorrow's date and 17:00.\n\nBut to get tomorrow's date, need to calculate from current date.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n- Then use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but set the time to 17:00. Wait, but shift_timestamp adds to the current time. So if current time is 14:30, adding 1 day (24 hours) would be 14:30 next day. To get to 17:00, need to add (24 - (current hour - 17)) hours? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user means 5 PM in their local time, so regardless of current time, it's 17:00 of the next day.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get year, month, day.\n3. Increment day by 1 (if day+1 exceeds days in month, handle month/year, but the function might handle that).\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do the increment, it needs to use functions. Wait, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires the exact year, month, day, etc. So perhaps:\n\n- First, get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n- Then, convert that timestamp to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current date components.\n- Then, calculate tomorrow's date (day +1, handling month/year rollover), but the assistant can't do that calculation; it has to rely on functions. Wait, maybe shift_timestamp can be used to add 1 day to the current timestamp, which would give the same time tomorrow. Then, adjust the hour to 17:00 by shifting hours.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nCurrent time: 2023-10-10 14:30:00 (timestamp T)\nShift by 1 day: 2023-10-11 14:30:00 (T + 86400)\nThen shift by (17 - 14) = 3 hours: T + 86400 + 10800 = 2023-10-11 17:30:00. But user wants 17:00, so maybe shift by 2.5 hours? Not precise.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting 1 day, set the time to 17:00 by adjusting hours, minutes, seconds.\n\nBut the functions don't allow setting specific time, only shifting by deltas.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the calculated tomorrow's date at 17:00.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp to get current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n3. Then, create a new datetime where day = current day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nBut the assistant can't perform the day+1 calculation; it has to use the functions. Wait, the assistant can generate the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp by incrementing the day.\n\nWait, the assistant is supposed to generate tool calls. So:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, get the datetime info from that timestamp:\n\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp.\n\nThen, use that info to construct tomorrow's 17:00.\n\nBut the problem is, the assistant can't process the response from the first tool call before making the next.
