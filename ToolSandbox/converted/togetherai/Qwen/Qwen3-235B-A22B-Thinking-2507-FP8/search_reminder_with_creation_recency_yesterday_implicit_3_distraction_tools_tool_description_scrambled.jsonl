The user is asking, \"What's the todo item I made yesterday?\" Hmm. I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, the user wants to know their todo item from yesterday. But looking at the tools provided, there's a function called search_reminder. The description says it can search reminders based on various parameters like creation timestamp, content, etc.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"yesterday,\" so I need to determine the timestamp range for yesterday. To do that, I probably need the current timestamp first. There's a function called get_current_timestamp that gives the current POSIX timestamp. So step one: get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can calculate the start and end of yesterday. But how? Maybe using the shift_timestamp function. If I get the current timestamp, then subtract one day to get yesterday's date, but I need the lower and upper bounds for the creation timestamp.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function has parameters creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So I need to find the timestamp for the start of yesterday (00:00:00) and the end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nBut to get those, I might need to convert the current date to a timestamp, then shift it back by one day, and then set the time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59. Wait, but how do I get the exact start and end of yesterday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use get_current_timestamp, then shift back by one day to get a timestamp in yesterday, then use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the date components, then set the time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59, then convert back to timestamps. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another approach: get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower bound as (current timestamp - 24 hours) but adjusted to the start of the day. Wait, maybe it's better to get the current date, subtract one day, then set the time to 00:00:00 for lower bound and 23:59:59 for upper bound.\n\nBut to do that, I need to convert the current timestamp to datetime info, subtract one day, then set the time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59, then convert back to timestamps.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on current_ts to get current date and time.\n3. Subtract one day from the date (using shift_timestamp or manually adjusting the datetime info).\n4. Create two datetime objects: one for start of yesterday (00:00:00) and end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n5. Convert those to timestamps using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n6. Use those timestamps as lower and upper bounds in search_reminder.\n\nBut the tools available include shift_timestamp, which can shift a timestamp by days, etc. So maybe:\n\n- Get current_ts.\n- Shift current_ts back by 1 day to get a timestamp in yesterday.\n- Then, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that shifted timestamp to get the date components.\n- Then, set hour, minute, second to 0 for lower bound, and 23,59,59 for upper bound.\n- Convert those to timestamps.\n\nWait, but shifting the current timestamp by 1 day might not land exactly at the start of yesterday if the current time is, say, 10 AM. Shifting back 24 hours would give 10 AM yesterday, but the start of yesterday is 00:00:00.\n\nSo perhaps a better approach is:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Subtract one day from the day component (handling month/year rollover if needed).\n4. Set hour, minute, second to 0 for lower bound.\n5. Set hour to 23, minute to 59, second to 59 for upper bound.\n6. Convert both to timestamps.\n\nBut the tools don't have a function to directly manipulate datetime components except through the conversion functions.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n- Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime.\n- Subtract 1 from the day, handling if day is 1 (then go to previous month, etc.).\n- Create lowerbound datetime: same year, month, day-1, 0,0,0.\n- Create upperbound datetime: same year, month, day-1, 23,59,59.\n- Convert both to timestamps using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n- Then call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut the problem is, the user might have created the reminder at any time yesterday, so the creation timestamp should be between start and end of yesterday.\n\nHowever, the user's question is ambiguous: \"yesterday\" could mean 24 hours ago from now, or the calendar day of yesterday. Depending on the user's intent, but typically \"yesterday\" refers to the previous calendar day.\n\nSo assuming calendar day, we need to find the start and end of yesterday in the user's timezone. But the tools don't mention timezones, so maybe assuming UTC.\n\nWait, but the functions don't specify timezone, so perhaps all timestamps are in UTC. So need to calculate based on UTC.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (UTC).\n2. Convert to UTC datetime.\n3. Subtract one day to get yesterday's date.\n4. Set time to 00:00:00 for lower, 23:59:59 for upper.\n5. Convert those to timestamps.\n\nBut how to do this with the given tools.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, create a new datetime for yesterday's start: year, month, day-1, 0,0,0.\n\nBut if day is 1, need to handle month and year. However, the tools don't have a function to handle date arithmetic beyond shift_timestamp. So maybe using shift_timestamp to get a timestamp that's 24 hours before current, but that's not the same as the start of yesterday.\n\nWait, another approach: shift the current timestamp back by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=-1), then set the time to 00:00:00 by converting to datetime info, adjusting the time, and converting back.\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function shifts by a certain amount, but to get the start of the day, maybe:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift back by current hour, minute, second to get start of today.\n- Then shift back 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n- Then shift forward 23h59m59s to get end of yesterday.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the following steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Subtract 1 from the day to get yesterday's date.\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the start of yesterday (00:00:00).\n5. Add 86399 seconds (23h59m59s) to get end of yesterday.\n\nBut how to subtract 1 from the day? The tools don't have a function for that. So maybe:\n\n- After getting current datetime info, create a new datetime with day = current day -1.\n- But if current day is 1, then month -1, etc. However, the user might not have reminders from edge cases, but the function needs to handle it.\n\nBut since the tools don't have a date manipulation function, perhaps the best way is:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get a timestamp 24 hours ago.\n\nBut that's not the start of yesterday, it's 24 hours before now.\n\nBut the user said \"yesterday\", which is the calendar day, not 24 hours ago.\n\nThis is a common ambiguity. For example, if today is June 5th, 10 AM, then yesterday's calendar day is June 4th, 00:00 to 23:59.\n\nBut 24 hours ago would be June 4th, 10 AM.\n\nSo to get the calendar day, we need to find the start and end of June 4th.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (now).\n2. Convert to datetime info (now_year, now_month, now_day, ...).\n3. Create a datetime for start of today: now_year, now_month, now_day, 0,0,0.\n4. Shift that back by 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n5. Start of yesterday is lower bound.\n6. End of yesterday is start of yesterday + 86399 seconds.\n\nBut how to get start of today?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0.\n- Convert back to timestamp (this is start of today).\n- Shift back 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n- Start of yesterday is lower bound.\n- End of yesterday is start of yesterday + 86399.\n\nSo:\n\nCall get_current_timestamp → current_ts.\n\nCall timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_ts) → {year, month, day, hour, min, sec}.\n\nCreate start_of_today = {year,", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
