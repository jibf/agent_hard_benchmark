The user is asking for the temperature in the Grand Canyon in Fahrenheit. Hmm, I need to figure out how to get that information.\n\nFirst, I know that the tools provided don't include a direct weather API. The available functions are search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, search_holiday, and unit_conversion. None of these seem to fetch real-time weather data. Wait, maybe I can use the location search to find the Grand Canyon's coordinates and then... but even then, there's no function to get the temperature. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the current temperature. But the tools don't have a weather function. The unit_conversion is there, but that's for converting between units, not fetching data. Maybe the user expects me to realize that I can't get the temperature directly. But perhaps they think the location search might include temperature info? Let me check the descriptions again.\n\nLooking at search_location_around_lat_lon: it says search results contain optional info like name, address, category, business hours, price, phone, url, location lat/lon. No mention of temperature. So that won't help. The other functions are for stocks, holidays, unit conversion, and reverse geocoding (search_lat_lon). \n\nSo, none of the tools can retrieve the current temperature. But the user might not know that. My job is to either use the tools or inform them it's not possible. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe they want to convert a temperature value they have, but they didn't provide one. Wait, the question is \"What's the temperature in Grand Canyon in Fahrenheit?\" So they're asking for the current temp there. Since I can't get that data, I should explain that none of the available tools can provide real-time weather info. But the instructions say to call functions if possible. Since there's no function for weather, I can't. So I should respond that I can't retrieve that info with the current tools. But wait, maybe the user expects me to use location search to get coordinates and then... but even if I had coordinates, there's no function to get temp. So the correct response is to state that I can't help with that request using the available tools.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time weather data or temperature information through the provided tools. The available functions can help with location searches, stock data, holiday dates, and unit conversions, but none can retrieve current temperature readings. Would you like me to help with something else that can be addressed using the available tools?", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
