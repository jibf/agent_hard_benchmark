The user wants to set a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for \"next Friday 5PM\". Since the user didn't specify a time zone, I should probably assume the current time zone of the user, but maybe the system handles that. However, the functions available don't mention time zones, so maybe POSIX timestamps are in UTC? Hmm, but the user might be in their local time. Wait, the functions like datetime_info_to_timestamp probably expect the datetime in the user's local time, and convert it to POSIX timestamp accordingly. But since the user didn't specify, maybe I need to get the current timestamp first to determine what \"next Friday\" is.\n\nWait, \"next Friday\" could be ambiguous. If today is Friday, does \"next Friday\" mean this coming Friday (7 days later) or the one after? Typically, \"next Friday\" would mean the upcoming Friday in the next week, so if today is Wednesday, next Friday is in 2 days. But if today is Friday, it might be 7 days later. To calculate that accurately, I need to know the current date.\n\nSo first step: get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. Then convert that to datetime info to find out what day of the week it is. Then determine the date of the next Friday.\n\nWait, but the functions available include timestamp_to_datetime_info, which gives isoweekday (1-7, Monday to Sunday). So if I get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, check the current day, then calculate how many days until next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a function to shift the timestamp. Wait, there's shift_timestamp, but that requires knowing the delta. But to find next Friday, I need to compute the days to add.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info (call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current timestamp).\n3. From datetime info, get isoweekday. Let's say today is Wednesday (isoweekday 3), then next Friday is 2 days later. If today is Friday (5), then next Friday is 7 days later.\n4. Calculate the number of days to add to reach next Friday.\n5. Then set the time to 5 PM (17:00) on that day.\n\nBut the user said \"next Friday 5PM\", so the time is 5 PM, which is 17:00.\n\nWait, but the user might be in a specific time zone, but since the functions don't handle time zones, maybe we assume the local time of the user, and the system converts it to UTC for the timestamp. However, the functions like datetime_info_to_timestamp probably take the local time and convert to POSIX timestamp (which is UTC-based). So the user's local time 5 PM next Friday needs to be converted to UTC timestamp.\n\nBut without knowing the user's time zone, this is tricky. However, perhaps the system is designed to handle the user's local time as the input, and the functions take care of the conversion. So assuming that when we input year, month, day, hour, etc., it's in the user's local time, and the function converts it to the correct POSIX timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Determine the date of next Friday at 5 PM in user's local time.\n- Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n\nTo do that:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp to know today's date.\n\nCall get_current_timestamp → current_ts.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current datetime info, including isoweekday.\n\nLet's say current isoweekday is X (1=Monday, 7=Sunday). Friday is 5.\n\nIf X <=5, then days_to_add = 5 - X.\n\nIf X >5, days_to_add = 7 - (X -5) = 12 - X.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf today is Thursday (4), next Friday is 1 day later (5-4=1).\n\nIf today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later (5-5=0 → but 0 would mean today, so we need 7 days).\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday that is not today. So if today is Friday, \"next Friday\" is 7 days later.\n\nSo formula:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7\n\nBut if the result is 0, then it's 7 days.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=5 (Friday):\n\n(5-5 +7) %7 =7%7=0 → but we want 7 days, so days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=6 (Saturday):\n\n(5-6 +7)=6 → 6 days.\n\ncurrent_isoweekday=3 (Wednesday):\n\n(5-3 +7)=9 → 9%7=2 → 2 days. Which is correct (Wed to Fri is 2 days).\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7\n\nBut if that's 0, set to 7.\n\nWait, (5 - X +7) %7 = (12 - X) %7.\n\nAlternatively, days_to_add = (5 - X) if X <=5 else (5 - X +7).\n\nBut perhaps using modulo is better.\n\nOnce days_to_add is calculated, then the target date is current date + days_to_add days, at 17:00 (5 PM).\n\nBut also need to set the hour, minute, second.\n\nSo after calculating the target date (year, month, day), set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen convert that datetime to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n\n2. Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add for next Friday.\n\n4. Add days_to_add to current date to get target date.\n\n5. Set time to 17:00:00.\n\n6. Convert target datetime to timestamp.\n\n7. Call add_reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\", reminder_timestamp as the calculated timestamp.\n\nBut the functions don't have a way to add days directly. So how to get the target date?\n\nAlternative approach: after getting current datetime info, compute the target year, month, day.\n\nFor example, current datetime info gives year, month, day, isoweekday.\n\nCompute days_to_add as above.\n\nThen target_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle month and year changes if target_day exceeds days in month.\n\nThis might get complicated. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp to add the days_to_add.\n\nWait, shift_timestamp can shift by days. So if I have current_ts, and I want to add days_to_add days, then call shift_timestamp with days=days_to_add.\n\nBut then, after shifting, I need to set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days would keep the same time. So if current time is, say, 10 AM, adding 2 days would be 10 AM two days later. But the user wants 5 PM on that day.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Shift to next Friday at the same time (using days_to_add).\n\n- Then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time?\n\nAlternatively, after shifting to the correct date (next Friday), get the datetime info of that timestamp, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current_ts.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info → current_info.\n\n3. Calculate days_to_add for next Friday.\n\n4. Shift current_ts by days_to_add days → shifted_ts.\n\n5. Convert shifted_ts to datetime info → shifted_info.\n\n6. Create new datetime info with shifted_info's year, month, day, but hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n7. Convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the shifted_ts is next Friday at the same time as current time. For example, if current time is 10 AM, shifted_ts is next Friday 10 AM. But user wants 5 PM, so need to adjust the time.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the date of next Friday (without time), set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo:\n\n- current_info gives current date and time.\n\n- Calculate target date (next Friday) as current date + days_to_add.\n\n- Set time to 17:00:00.\n\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to compute target date?\n\nMaybe:\n\ncurrent_info has year, month, day.\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday +7) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0: days_to_add=7\n\ntarget_day = current_day + days_to_add\n\nBut need to handle if target_day exceeds days in month.\n\nThis might require knowing the number of days in the current month, which is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days to current_ts, which gives a timestamp for next Friday at the same time. Then, get the datetime info of that timestamp, and then set the hour, minute, second to 17,0,0, then convert back.\n\nBut how to set the time? For example:\n\nSuppose shifted_ts is next Friday at 10 AM (current time).
