So I need to find reminders that were set for yesterday. But to do that, I need to know what yesterday's date is relative to today.\n\nFrom the previous steps, the assistant already got the current timestamp (1755243281.812605) and converted it to datetime info, which shows the current date is August 15, 2025. So yesterday would be August 14, 2025.\n\nNow, I need to get the timestamp for yesterday's date. To do that, I can take the current timestamp and shift it back by one day. The function shift_timestamp can be used here. The parameters would be the current timestamp and days=-1.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp is 1755243281.812605, which corresponds to August 15, 2025. Shifting back one day would give me August 14, 2025. But I need to make sure that the shift is accurate. Let me check: shifting by days=-1 should subtract 24 hours, which is correct for yesterday.\n\nSo first, call shift_timestamp with timestamp=1755243281.812605 and days=-1. That will give the timestamp for the start of yesterday? Wait, no. The shift is just a time delta, so shifting back one day from the current time (3:34 AM on the 15th) would give 3:34 AM on the 14th. But the user might want all reminders set for the entire day of yesterday, so from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 on the 14th.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to get the start and end timestamps for yesterday. So to get the lower bound, it's the start of yesterday (midnight), and upper bound is the start of today (midnight). So perhaps after shifting back one day, I need to adjust the time to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound.\n\nWait, but how to get the exact timestamps for the start and end of yesterday. Let me think.\n\nThe current datetime is 2025-08-15 03:34:41. So yesterday is 2025-08-14. The start of yesterday would be 2025-08-14 00:00:00, and the end would be 2025-08-14 23:59:59.\n\nTo get the start of yesterday, I can take the current timestamp, subtract one day, then set the time to 00:00:00. But how to do that with the available functions.\n\nAlternatively, use the shift_timestamp function to get a timestamp for yesterday at the same time, but then adjust to the start of the day.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: use datetime_info_to_timestamp to create the start and end times for yesterday.\n\nSince we know the current date is 2025-08-15, yesterday is 2025-08-14. So for the lower bound, it's 2025-08-14 00:00:00, and upper bound is 2025-08-14 23:59:59.\n\nSo I can use datetime_info_to_timestamp for the lower bound with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nBut how do I get the day=14? From the previous step, the current day is 15, so subtracting 1 gives 14.\n\nWait, the current datetime info is {'year': 2025, 'month': 8, 'day': 15, ...}, so yesterday's day is 14.\n\nSo to get the start of yesterday, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSimilarly, end of yesterday would be day=14, hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nTherefore, I need to make two calls to datetime_info_to_timestamp: one for the lower bound (start of yesterday) and one for the upper bound (end of yesterday).\n\nWait, but the user is asking for \"todo yesterday\", which probably refers to reminders that are set for yesterday, i.e., their reminder timestamp is within yesterday's date.\n\nSo the search_reminder function requires reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and reminder_timestamp_upperbound.\n\nThus, I need to calculate those two timestamps.\n\nSo first, get the lower bound: 2025-08-14 00:00:00 as a timestamp.\n\nSecond, upper bound: 2025-08-14 23:59:59 as a timestamp.\n\nTo get these, use datetime_info_to_timestamp for both.\n\nSo first call datetime_info_to_timestamp with parameters for 2025-08-14 00:00:00.\n\nSecond call for 2025-08-14 23:59:59.\n\nThen use those timestamps as the lower and upper bounds in search_reminder.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shift the current timestamp back by one day and then adjust to midnight, but using datetime_info_to_timestamp is more precise.\n\nGiven that we have the current date components (year=2025, month=8, day=15), subtracting one day gives day=14. So the lower bound is year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound is same date but 23:59:59.\n\nSo the next step is to call datetime_info_to_timestamp for both lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, but the user might not have specified time, so maybe the reminders are set for the entire day. So using the day's start and end as the timestamp bounds makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should first generate the lower and upper timestamps for yesterday, then use search_reminder with those bounds.\n\nSo the next tool calls would be:\n\n1. datetime_info_to_timestamp for lower bound (2025-08-14 00:00:00)\n2. datetime_info_to_timestamp for upper bound (2025-08-14 23:59:59)\n3. Then search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to those values.\n\nBut the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, noâ€”the user is allowing multiple tool calls in sequence. Wait, the instructions say \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo in each assistant response, they can make one tool call, then wait for the response, then proceed.\n\nBut in this case, to get the lower and upper bounds, two separate calls to datetime_info_to_timestamp are needed.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For example, get the current timestamp, shift back one day to get a timestamp within yesterday, then convert that to datetime info, set the time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59, then convert back to timestamps.\n\nBut given the available functions, perhaps the straightforward way is to use the known date (2025-08-14) from the current date minus one day.\n\nSince the current date is 2025-08-15, yesterday is 2025-08-14. So the lower bound is 2025-08-14 00:00:00.\n\nSo first, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen call it again for 23:59:59.\n\nBut the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So first, make the call for the lower bound.\n\nWait, but the assistant needs to generate both timestamps. Let's see.\n\nIn the previous step, the assistant has the current datetime info: {'year': 2025, 'month': 8, 'day': 15, ...}.\n\nSo yesterday's day is 14. So to get the start of yesterday:\n\nCall datetime_info_to_timestamp with year=2025, month=8, day=14, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nSimilarly, for the end of yesterday: day=14, hour=23, minute=59, second=59.\n\nSo the next step is to make the first call for the lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the next tool call should be datetime_info_to_timestamp with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"datetime_info_to_timestamp\", \"arguments\": {\"year\": ", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sorry, I'm not sure how to help."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_wvyra6gx6jucmgpq9ceh8uc6", "function": {"arguments": "{\"day\": 14, \"hour\": 0, \"minute\": 0, \"month\": 8, \"second\": 0, \"year\": 2025}", "name": "datetime_info_to_timestamp"}, "type": "function"}], "turn_idx": 4}, {"tool_call_id": "call_wvyra6gx6jucmgpq9ceh8uc6", "role": "tool", "name": "datetime_info_to_timestamp", "content": "1755144000.0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_2mj7ezn2wrqye1xopenb83fk", "function": {"arguments": "{\"reminder_timestamp_lowerbound\": 1755144000, \"reminder_timestamp_upperbound\": 1755230400}", "name": "search_reminder"}, "type": "function"}], "turn_idx": 5}, {"tool_call_id": "call_2mj7ezn2wrqye1xopenb83fk", "role": "tool", "name": "search_reminder", "content": "[{'reminder_id': '8f5b6fc6-1c25-5467-91ba-d4d1e17c7129', 'content': 'Look for Company SF tickets', 'creation_timestamp': 1754979716.257928, 'reminder_timestamp': 1755152516.257933, 'latitude': None, 'longitude': None}]", "tool_details": {"milestone_matches": [{"milestone_index": 1, "milestone": {"snapshot_constraints": [{"database_namespace": "SANDBOX", "snapshot_constraint": "snapshot_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": null, "target_dataframe": [{"sender": "EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT", "recipient": "AGENT", "tool_trace": "{\"tool_name\": \"search_reminder\", \"arguments\": {}}"}], "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "openai_tool_call_id": "column_one_similarity", "openai_function_name": "column_one_similarity", "conversation_active": "column_exact_match_similarity", "tool_call_exception": "column_one_similarity", "tool_trace": "column_tool_trace_exact_match_similarity", "visible_to": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "MESSAGING", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 0, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "message_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender_person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender_phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient_person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient_phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "creation_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "REMINDER", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 0, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "reminder_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "creation_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity", "reminder_timestamp": "column_exact_match_similarity", "latitude": "column_exact_match_similarity", "longitude": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "CONTACT", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 0, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "person_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "name": "column_exact_match_similarity", "phone_number": "column_exact_match_similarity", "relationship": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "is_self": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}, {"database_namespace": "SETTING", "snapshot_constraint": "guardrail_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": 0, "target_dataframe": null, "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "device_id": "column_exact_match_similarity", "cellular": "column_exact_match_similarity", "wifi": "column_exact_match_similarity", "location_service": "column_exact_match_similarity", "low_battery_mode": "column_exact_match_similarity", "latitude": "column_exact_match_similarity", "longitude": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}], "guardrail_database_list": ["SANDBOX", "SETTING", "CONTACT", "MESSAGING", "REMINDER"], "guardrail_database_exclusion_list": null}, "milestone_similarity": 1.0}]}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked, \"What's my todo yesterday?\" So first, I need to figure out what \"yesterday\" refers to. The current timestamp was retrieved as 1755243281.812605, which converts to August 15, 2025. So yesterday would be August 14, 2025.\n\nI called the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the date set to August 14 to get the start of the day (midnight) as 1755144000.0. Then, I assumed that \"yesterday\" spans from midnight to 23:59:59, so the upper bound would be the next day's midnight minus one second. Wait, but in the tool call, the upper bound was set to 1755230400. Let me check that.\n\nWait, 1755144000 is August 14, 00:00:00. The next day's midnight is 1755230400 (August 15, 00:00:00). So the range from 1755144000 to 1755230400 covers the entire day of August 14. But 1755230400 is exactly the next day's start, so the upper bound should be exclusive. However, in the search_reminder function, it's a lower and upper bound, so maybe the reminder_timestamp needs to be within that range. The result shows a reminder with reminder_timestamp 1755152516.257933, which is August 14, 02:21:56 (since 1755144000 is midnight, adding 8516 seconds gives about 2 hours and 21 minutes). So that's within the range.\n\nThe user's question was about \"todo yesterday,\" so the search was for reminders set for yesterday. The response from the tool shows one reminder: \"Look for Company SF tickets.\" So the answer should list that as the todo for yesterday.\n\nI need to present this clearly. The user might expect a simple list of todos from yesterday. Since there's one entry, state that and provide the content. Also, check if there are any other parameters, but in this case, the search was based on reminder timestamp, which is correct for when the reminder is set to trigger. So the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nYour todo for yesterday (August 14, 2025) was:  \n**\"Look for Company SF tickets\"**  \n\nThis reminder was scheduled to trigger at 02:21:56 UTC on August 14, 2025.

Let me check the conversation history.\n\nEarlier, they asked \"What's my todo yesterday?\" and I helped them by finding the reminder for August 14, 2025, which was \"Look for Company SF tickets\". Now they're asking \"Could you tell me what I needed to do yesterday?\" which seems like the same question.\n\nWait, but maybe the date has changed? Let me check the previous steps. In the history, the current timestamp was 1755243281.812605, which converted to August 15, 2025. So yesterday would be August 14. The search was for reminders between 1755144000 (start of August 14) and 1755230400 (end of August 14). The result was one reminder.\n\nNow the user is asking again, but if the current date is still August 15, then yesterday is still August 14. The previous answer already provided the todo. Maybe they just want confirmation or maybe there's a mistake. Wait, but the user might not realize that the date hasn't changed. Since the previous response already answered it, perhaps I should just reiterate the same information. But the user might be testing if the system remembers or if there's a new query.\n\nWait, but in the current context, the user hasn't provided any new information. The previous tool calls were to get the current timestamp, convert it, calculate yesterday's timestamp, and search. The result was a specific reminder. Since the user is asking again, maybe they want the same answer. However, maybe there's a need to check again in case the current date has changed, but in the context given, the current timestamp was fixed from the previous interaction.\n\nWait, looking at the tool responses, the get_current_timestamp returned 1755243281.812605, which is August 15, 2025. So \"yesterday\" is August 14. The search was done for that date, and the result was the reminder. Now the user is asking again, but unless the current date has changed, the answer remains the same.\n\nBut the user might not know that the system's current date is fixed here. Since this is a simulated environment, the current timestamp from the previous step is still valid. Therefore, the answer should be the same as before. However, the user might have intended to ask for a different date, but the question is the same as before. So the correct response is to provide the same todo list as yesterday.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is asking for clarification or wants more details. However, the previous answer already provided the content. So the assistant should repeat the information, perhaps in a slightly different wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if the system retains context. Since the previous interaction already retrieved the data, the assistant can directly state the todo without making new tool calls. But according to the instructions, if the user's request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. However, in this case, the request is clear: \"what I needed to do yesterday\" refers to the same \"yesterday\" as before, which is August 14, 2025.\n\nWait, but the system should check if \"yesterday\" is still the same. However, since the current timestamp in the context is fixed (from the previous get_current_timestamp response), it's still August 15. So yesterday is still the 14th. Therefore, the answer remains the same.\n\nThe previous response already provided the todo, so the assistant should just restate it. But the user might be expecting the same answer. Therefore, the correct action is to output the same information as before without making additional tool calls, since the data hasn't changed.\n</think>\n\nYour task for yesterday (August 14, 2025) was:  \n**\"Look for Company SF tickets\"**  \n\nThis reminder was scheduled to trigger at 02:21:56 UTC on August 14, 2025.
