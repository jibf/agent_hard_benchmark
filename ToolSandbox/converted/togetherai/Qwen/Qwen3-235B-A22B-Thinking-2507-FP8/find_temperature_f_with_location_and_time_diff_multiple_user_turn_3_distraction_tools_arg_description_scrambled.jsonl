The user asked for the lowest temperature in the Grand Canyon today.\n\nFirst, I used the search_location_around_lat_lon function to find the coordinates of the Grand Canyon. The response gave me the latitude and longitude: 36.2678855 and -112.3535253.\n\nThen, I called search_weather_around_lat_lon with those coordinates. The weather data came back with a min_temperature of 14.7°C.\n\nWait, the user asked for the lowest temperature today. The weather response has min_temperature as 14.7. But I should check if that's in Celsius. The response says temperature_unit is Celsius, so yes.\n\nIs there any other temperature field that might be lower? Let me check the other fields. Current temperature is 12.2, but that's the current temp, not the min for the day. The min_temperature is listed as 14.7. Wait, but current temp is lower than the min? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the data again: current_temperature is 12.2, but min_temperature is 14.7. That's odd because the current temp shouldn't be lower than the daily minimum. Maybe the min_temperature is for the forecasted day, but the current time is early morning, so the min might have already occurred. Wait, the localtime is 2025-08-15 03:47, which is 3:47 AM. The min temperature for the day is often in the early morning, so maybe the current temp is the min. But the response lists min_temperature as 14.7. Hmm, perhaps there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe the min_temperature in the response is the forecasted minimum for the day. Let me check the parameters of the search_weather_around_lat_lon function. The description says it includes \"temperature: In Celsius\" and other forecast info. The response has max_temperature 28.0, min_temperature 14.7. But current temperature is 12.2. That seems conflicting. Maybe the current temperature is at the time of the API call, which is 3:47 AM, and the min for the day is expected to be 14.7 later? Or perhaps the API's min_temperature is the lowest expected for the day, but the current temp is lower because it's early morning.\n\nWait, but the current temperature is 12.2, which is lower than the min_temperature of 14.7. That doesn't add up. Maybe there's an error in the data. Alternatively, maybe the min_temperature refers to the minimum for the next 24 hours, but the current time is before the min occurs. Wait, the localtime is 3:47 AM, and sunrise is at 5:47 AM. Maybe the temperature will rise after sunrise, so the current temp is the lowest point, but the API's min_temperature is 14.7. That doesn't align. Maybe the API's min_temperature is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the fields.\n\nLooking back at the tool response: 'min_temperature': 14.7. The user asked for the lowest temperature today. If the API says the min is 14.7, but the current temp is 12.2, which is lower, then perhaps the current temp is the actual min so far, but the forecasted min for the day is 14.7. But that still doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the min_temperature is the lowest expected for the day, but the current temp is lower because it's still early. Wait, maybe the min_temperature is for the entire day's forecast, but the current time is before the min occurs. Wait, no—usually the min temperature for the day occurs around sunrise, which is 5:47 AM here. The current time is 3:47 AM, so maybe the temperature will drop a bit more before sunrise, but the API's min is 14.7. However, the current temp is already 12.2, which is lower. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the units are mixed up. The temperature_unit is Celsius, so 12.2°C is about 54°F, which is plausible for early morning in the Grand Canyon in August. The min_temperature of 14.7°C is about 58.5°F. But if it's currently 12.2°C (54°F) at 3:47 AM, and sunrise is at 5:47 AM, maybe the temperature will rise after that, making 12.2 the actual low for the day. But the API lists min_temperature as 14.7. There's a contradiction here.\n\nPerhaps the 'min_temperature' in the response is the minimum expected for the day, but the current temperature is lower because the data is from a different source or there's a delay. Alternatively, maybe the 'min_temperature' refers to the minimum for the next 24 hours, but the current temp is part of that period. This is a bit confusing.\n\nGiven the data provided, the API response explicitly states 'min_temperature': 14.7. Even though the current temperature is lower, perhaps the min_temperature is the forecasted low for the day, and the current temperature might be a temporary dip. Or maybe there's an error in the data. But as per the tool response, the min_temperature is 14.7°C.\n\nWait, looking at the tool response again: the 'current_temperature' is 12.2, but 'min_temperature' is 14.7. That seems contradictory. Maybe 'min_temperature' is the minimum for the day's forecast, but the current temperature is from a different time. Wait, the 'localtime' is 2025-08-15 03:47, which is 3:47 AM. The 'min_temperature' might be the lowest expected during the day (from midnight to midnight), but perhaps the current temperature is lower than the forecasted min. However, that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the 'min_temperature' is for the next 24 hours starting from the current time, but the current temp is part of that period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'min_temperature' in the response is actually the minimum for the day, and the current temperature is lower because it's still early morning, but the API's data might have a mistake. However, as an assistant, I should rely on the data provided by the tool response.\n\nGiven that the tool response includes 'min_temperature': 14.7, I should report that as the lowest temperature for today. Even though the current temperature is lower, perhaps the min_temperature is the expected low for the entire day, and the current reading might not be the absolute minimum. Or maybe there's a data inconsistency, but I have to go with what's provided.\n\nSo, converting 14.7°C to Fahrenheit if needed, but the user didn't specify units. The original question says \"lowest temperature,\" and the response is in Celsius. The user might expect Fahrenheit since it's the US, but the tool specifies temperature_unit as Celsius. Wait, the Grand Canyon is in the US, where Fahrenheit is commonly used. However, the API returns Celsius. The user might want the answer in Fahrenheit.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify units, but in the US, people usually refer to temperature in Fahrenheit. So I should convert 14.7°C to Fahrenheit. Let me calculate that: (14.7°C × 9/5) + 32 = 58.46°F, which rounds to 58.5°F.\n\nBut wait, the tool response says temperature_unit is Celsius, so the min_temperature is 14.7°C. The user might expect the answer in Fahrenheit. However, the question doesn't specify, but given the location is in the US, it's safer to provide both or convert to Fahrenheit.\n\nAlternatively, check if the tool response has any other temperature fields. The response also has 'current_temperature' 12.2°C, which is 54°F, but that's the current temp, not the daily min.\n\nWait, the user asked for the lowest temperature today. The min_temperature in the response is 14.7°C, which is 58.5°F. But if the current temperature is 12.2°C (54°F) and it's 3:47 AM, which is before sunrise, it's possible that the temperature will drop a bit more, making the actual low lower than 14.7. However, the API's min_temperature is listed as 14.7, so perhaps that's their forecasted low.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but as per the data provided by the tool, the min_temperature is 14.7°C. So I should present that, possibly converting to Fahrenheit for the user's convenience since it's the US.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest temperature in the Grand Canyon today is **14.7°C (58.5°F)**, based on the latest weather forecast for the area. This reflects the expected minimum temperature for the day. \n\n*Note: Current temperature at the time of this response is 12.2°C (54°F), but the forecasted daily low remains 14.7°C.*", "turn_idx":

So, they're asking for the minimum temperature forecast for the next day.\n\nLooking at the tools available, the search_weather_around_lat_lon function can take a \"days\" parameter. In the previous call for today, days wasn't specified (or was 0 by default). For tomorrow, I should set days=1 to get the forecast for the next day.\n\nWait, in the tool response for the previous user message, when they asked \"What about tomorrow?\", the assistant called the function with days=1.

The response says temperature_unit is Celsius, so 17.0°C. Maybe convert to Fahrenheit as well since the user might prefer that, but the previous answer included both.
