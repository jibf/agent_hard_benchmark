The user wants to be reminded to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. But wait, what's the current time? Maybe I should get the current timestamp first. There's a function called get_current_timestamp. Let me check that.\n\nWait, but maybe I can calculate tomorrow's date. But to do that accurately, I need to know the current date. So using get_current_timestamp would give me the current POSIX time, which I can then convert to datetime info to find out today's date. Then add one day and set the time to 5 PM.\n\nAlternatively, there's a shift_timestamp function. If I get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day and set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shift_timestamp allows adding days, hours, etc. So if I get the current timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, but also adjust the time to 5 PM. Hmm, but the current time might not be exactly 12:00 AM, so just adding 1 day would take me to the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is: get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then set the date to tomorrow and time to 17:00 (5 PM), then convert that back to a timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime_info to see current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Then create a new datetime with day +1, hour 17, minute 0, second 0.\n4. Convert that new datetime to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but what if tomorrow is in the next month or year? The datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that as long as the inputs are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use shift_timestamp. For example, if current time is, say, 2023-10-05 10:00:00, then shifting by 1 day would get to 2023-10-06 10:00:00. But the user wants 5 PM, so need to adjust the time. So perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift it by 1 day to get tomorrow same time.\n- Then shift hours to 17:00. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe better to calculate the exact timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime_info to get current date and time.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (if day +1 exceeds days in month, handle month/year changes).\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert that new datetime to timestamp.\n\nBut since the functions available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second, I need to compute those values.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, calculate tomorrow's date. For example, if today is October 5, then tomorrow is October 6. But need to handle month-end cases, like October 31 -> November 1.\n\nBut the timestamp_to_datetime_info will give the correct current date, so adding 1 day via datetime might require handling, but perhaps the shift_timestamp function can help here.\n\nWait, there's a shift_timestamp function. Let's see: if I take the current timestamp, shift it by 1 day, that gives me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM, so if current time is, say, 10 AM, shifting by 1 day would give 10 AM tomorrow, but we need 5 PM. So perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Shift it by (1 day + 7 hours) if current hour is 10 AM, but that's variable. Alternatively, set the time to 17:00:00 of tomorrow.\n\nHmm, maybe better to:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime_info.\n3. Create a new datetime with day = current day +1, hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n4. Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle day+1 correctly? For example, if today is the 31st of a month with 31 days, adding 1 day would roll over to next month.\n\nBut the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that as long as the input parameters are correct. So if I take the current datetime_info, add 1 to the day, and if it exceeds the days in the month, the function would adjust month and year accordingly. Wait, no—the function datetime_info_to_timestamp expects valid year, month, day. So if I just increment the day by 1 without checking, it might be invalid (like 31 +1 in a 30-day month). So I need a way to correctly compute tomorrow's date.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to the current timestamp, which would handle the date rollover correctly. Then, adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by 1 day to get T + 1 day.\n- Then, get the datetime_info of T +1 day.\n- Set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Convert that back to timestamp.\n\nBut how to set the hour? Maybe:\n\nAfter shifting by 1 day, we have the same time tomorrow. Then, calculate the difference between that time and 17:00, and shift accordingly.\n\nFor example, if shifting by 1 day gives us 2023-10-06 10:00:00 (current time was 10 AM), then we need to add 7 hours to get to 5 PM.\n\nBut this requires knowing the current hour. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (current_ts).\n2. Shift current_ts by 1 day to get tomorrow_same_time_ts.\n3. Convert tomorrow_same_time_ts to datetime_info to get hour, min, sec.\n4. Calculate the hours needed to reach 17:00. If current hour is H, then delta_hours = 17 - H. If H >17, then delta_hours = 17 - H +24 (but since it's tomorrow, maybe H is less than 17? Wait, no—if current time is 6 PM, then tomorrow same time is 6 PM, but user wants 5 PM, which is earlier. So delta would be negative.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime_info.\n- Set day = day +1, hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nBut need to ensure that day+1 is valid. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle invalid dates by rolling over. Wait, but the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp require valid year, month, day. So if day is 32 in a 31-day month, it would be invalid. So the user's function might not handle that, so we need to compute the correct date.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day to the current timestamp, which gives the correct tomorrow date (handling month/year rollover), then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on current_ts to get current datetime.\n3. Create a new datetime where:\n   - year = current year\n   - month = current month\n   - day = current day +1\n   - hour =17\n   - minute=0\n   - second=0\n4. But need to handle if day+1 exceeds days in month. However, without knowing the number of days in the month, this is error-prone.\n\nAlternative approach using shift_timestamp:\n\n- Get current_ts.\n- Shift current_ts by 1 day to get tomorrow_ts (same time).\n- Then, get the datetime_info of tomorrow_ts.\n- Now, calculate the difference between 17:00 and the current hour in tomorrow_ts.\n- For example, if tomorrow_ts is 2023-10-06 10:00:00, then we need to add 7 hours to get to 17:00.\n- So shift tomorrow_ts by (7 hours) to get the desired time.\n\nBut how to compute the hours to shift?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet’s say current time is 2023-10-05 14:00:00 (2 PM). User wants tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nShift current_ts by 1 day: 2023-10-06 14:00:00.\n\nWe need to get to 17:00, so add 3 hours: 14 +3 =17.\n\nSo shift by 3 hours.\n\nAnother example: current time is 2023-10-05 18:00 (6 PM). User wants tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nShift current_ts by 1 day: 2023-10-06 18", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
