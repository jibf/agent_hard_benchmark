The user asked where the Golden Gate Bridge is. I tried using the search_location_around_lat_lon function, but first I didn't provide latitude and longitude, so it probably tried to use the current location. But the system said \"PermissionError: Location service is not enabled.\" So maybe the app doesn't have access to the user's location.\n\nThen I tried again, this time manually entering the coordinates for the Golden Gate Bridge (37.8199, -122.4783), which I know from prior knowledge. But then the response was \"ConnectionError: Wifi is not enabled.\" Hmm, so even though I provided the coordinates, the function still needs an internet connection to get the location data, and since Wi-Fi is off, it can't connect.\n\nWait, the user's device might not have Wi-Fi enabled, so the function can't access the internet to fetch the location details. The error message says Wi-Fi is not enabled, so maybe cellular data isn't available either, or the function requires Wi-Fi specifically.\n\nWhat can I do here? The user wants to know where the Golden Gate Bridge is. Since the function calls are failing due to location and Wi-Fi issues, maybe I should inform the user that I can't access the location services or internet to get the information. But wait, maybe there's another way. Do I have any other functions that can provide this info without needing location or Wi-Fi?\n\nLooking at the tools provided: there's get_current_location, but that would require location services, which are disabled. There's search_lat_lon, but that also needs to convert lat/lon to an address, which probably requires internet. The user already provided the coordinates in the second attempt, but the function still failed because Wi-Fi is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the known coordinates to state the location directly without calling a function. Since I know the Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, coordinates approximately 37.8199° N, 122.4783° W. But the user might want more details like the address or nearby places.\n\nWait, the function search_location_around_lat_lon is supposed to return address, category, etc. But without internet, it can't. So perhaps the correct response is to tell the user that without Wi-Fi or location services enabled, I can't retrieve the information, but I can provide the general location based on common knowledge.\n\nBut the user's question is straightforward: \"Where's the Golden Gate Bridge?\" The answer is San Francisco, California. Maybe I should just answer that directly since the tools aren't working due to disabled services.\n\nHowever, the instructions say not to make assumptions and ask for clarification if ambiguous. But in this case, the user's query isn't ambiguous. The problem is the tool errors. Since the tools are failing, the assistant should handle it by informing the user of the issue and providing the answer from general knowledge.\n\nWait, but the assistant is supposed to use the tools when possible. However, in this case, the tools are failing because of disabled services. So the correct step is to either enable the necessary services (like Wi-Fi) or provide the answer without tools.\n\nBut the user hasn't indicated they can enable Wi-Fi or location services. So the assistant should probably inform them that the services are disabled and maybe provide the answer based on existing knowledge.\n\nLooking back at the previous attempts: first call without lat/lon failed due to location service off. Second call with hardcoded lat/lon failed due to Wi-Fi off. So even with coordinates, the function needs internet (Wi-Fi or cellular) to get the location data.\n\nSince the user's device has Wi-Fi disabled, and maybe cellular is also off (since earlier there was a cellular service status check), but the error was specifically about Wi-Fi.\n\nSo the assistant should explain that without Wi-Fi, it can't retrieve the location details, but the Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California. Alternatively, check if cellular service is available to use instead of Wi-Fi.\n\nWait, there's a function get_cellular_service_status. Maybe check if cellular is enabled to use data. But the user hasn't asked for that. However, the previous error was about Wi-Fi, so maybe cellular is available.\n\nBut the user's problem is that they want the location of the bridge. The assistant tried using the location function, which requires internet. Since Wi-Fi is off, maybe switch to cellular data. But the assistant can't enable cellular data; it would need to check if it's available.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant could inform the user that Wi-Fi is off, so it can't get the data, but here's the general location.\n\nIn this case, since the tool calls are failing, the correct response is to tell the user the known location without relying on the tools.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California, spanning the Golden Gate Strait. Its approximate coordinates are **37.8199° N, 122.4783° W**. \n\nSince Wi-Fi and location services are disabled on your device, I cannot retrieve real-time details (e.g., address, nearby businesses), but this is the well-known location of the bridge.

The assistant tried to search for the location but got a PermissionError because location services were off.

The user asked for their current location, so I should provide that address. Also, maybe mention that it's Apple Park. They might be at Apple's main campus. Let me check if the coordinates match. 37.334606, -122.009102 is indeed the approximate coordinates of Apple Park. So the response should state their current location as Apple Park, Cupertino, and maybe offer further help.\n\nWait, the user said they don't know their current location, so now that we have it, I should present it clearly. Also, since they were trying to get the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge earlier, maybe mention the distance again now that we have the exact address. But the user's latest query is just asking for their current location, so focus on that.\n\nMake sure to explain where they are, confirm the address, and perhaps ask if they need anything else. Keep it friendly and helpful.\n</think>\n\nYour current location is **One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA** — the address of Apple Park, Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. 🌍  \n\nThis matches the coordinates we retrieved earlier (37.3346° N, 122.0091° W).
