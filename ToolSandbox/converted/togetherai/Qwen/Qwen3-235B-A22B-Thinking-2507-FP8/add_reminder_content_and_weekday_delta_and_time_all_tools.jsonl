The user wants a reminder to buy chocolate milk next Friday at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. Since the user didn't specify a time zone, I'll assume it's based on their current location. But to get the correct timestamp, I might need the current time and date.\n\nWait, the function add_reminder requires a POSIX timestamp for reminder_timestamp. So I need to calculate that. To do that, I probably need the current timestamp to determine what \"next Friday\" means.\n\nSo first step: get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp. That will tell me the current date and time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can figure out when next Friday is. Let's say today is Tuesday, then next Friday is in 3 days. But if today is Friday, then next Friday would be 7 days later. Wait, the user said \"next Friday\", which usually means the upcoming Friday, even if it's today. Wait, but if today is Friday, \"next Friday\" might mean the following week. Hmm, but maybe the function shift_timestamp can help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the date of the next Friday. Let's think: if today is Monday, next Friday is 4 days later. If today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later. So regardless, \"next Friday\" is the upcoming Friday, which could be 0-6 days away.\n\nBut to compute that, I need the current day of the week. So perhaps first get the current timestamp, then convert it to datetime info to find the current day.\n\nWait, there's a function timestamp_to_datetime_info which gives the isoweekday (1-7, where Monday is 1, Sunday is 7). So if I get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, check the isoweekday, then calculate how many days until next Friday.\n\nWait, Friday is isoweekday 5. So if current day is d, then days until next Friday is (5 - d + 7) % 7. If d is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7)%7 = 7%7=0, so 0 days? But \"next Friday\" would be 7 days later. Hmm, maybe the calculation is (5 - d) % 7, but if it's negative, add 7. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf today is Monday (1), days until Friday: 5-1=4.\n\nIf today is Friday (5), 5-5=0, but \"next\" Friday would be 7 days later. So perhaps if the result is 0, add 7.\n\nSo the formula would be: days = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If days ==0, then days=7.\n\nWait, (5 - current_day) %7. Let's test:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): (5-5)=0 → 0%7=0 → days=7.\n\ncurrent_day=6 (Saturday): (5-6)= -1 → (-1 +7)=6 → 6%7=6 → days=6.\n\ncurrent_day=4 (Thursday): 5-4=1 → 1 day.\n\nYes, that works. So days = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. If the result is 0, it's 7 days.\n\nSo once I have the current day from timestamp_to_datetime_info, I can compute the days until next Friday.\n\nThen, shift the current timestamp by those days, plus 17 hours (5 PM is 17:00 in 24h format) and 0 minutes, 0 seconds.\n\nWait, but the user said 5 PM, which is 17:00. So the time part is 17 hours.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n\n2. Convert current timestamp to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days until next Friday.\n\n4. Shift current timestamp by days, hours=17, minutes=0, seconds=0.\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So if I need to add, say, 3 days and set the time to 17:00, but the current time is, say, 10 AM, then shifting by 3 days would take me to 10 AM three days later, but I need 5 PM. So maybe better to calculate the exact timestamp for next Friday 5 PM.\n\nAlternative approach: once I have the current date, find the date of next Friday, set the time to 17:00, then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, perhaps after getting current datetime info, compute the target date.\n\nBut the available functions include shift_timestamp and datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n- Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n\n- Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n\n- Calculate the target date: next Friday.\n\n- Set the time to 17:00:00.\n\n- Convert that target datetime to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut how to calculate next Friday?\n\nSuppose current isoweekday is d (1=Mon, 5=Fri).\n\nDays to add: (5 - d + 7) %7. If 0, then 7.\n\nSo target_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n\nBut need to handle month and year changes if adding days goes into next month/year.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add the days, then adjust the time.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can shift by days, hours, etc. So if I shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to set the time? Because shifting by days would keep the same time of day.\n\nWait, for example, if current time is Wednesday 10 AM, days_to_add is 2 (to get to Friday), shifting by 2 days would get to Friday 10 AM. But we need 5 PM, so need to add 7 more hours.\n\nSo total shift: days_to_add days + 7 hours.\n\nWait, 5 PM is 17:00, so if current hour is h, then hours to add is 17 - h. But if 17 < h, then it's 17 - h + 24.\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting to the correct day (next Friday), set the time to 17:00:00 regardless of current time.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe better to compute the target date and time as follows:\n\n- Target date is next Friday.\n\n- Target time is 17:00:00.\n\nSo, for example, if today is Monday, next Friday is in 4 days. So target date is current date +4 days, time 17:00.\n\nTo get that timestamp:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n\n3. Calculate days to add to reach next Friday.\n\n4. Add those days to current date (using shift_timestamp with days=days_to_add).\n\n5. Then, adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut shifting by days will keep the same time. So if current time is 10 AM, shifting by 4 days gives Friday 10 AM. Then need to add 7 hours to get to 5 PM.\n\nSo total shift: days_to_add days + 7 hours.\n\nWait, but if current time is after 5 PM, say 6 PM, then next Friday 5 PM would be days_to_add days minus 1 day plus 23 hours? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: once we have the current timestamp, calculate the timestamp for next Friday 5 PM directly.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose today is Tuesday, October 10, 2023, 9 AM.\n\nNext Friday is October 13, 5 PM.\n\nCurrent timestamp is for Oct 10, 9 AM.\n\nWe need to find the timestamp for Oct 13, 5 PM.\n\nSo days to add: 3 days (from Tue to Fri), and hours to add: 8 hours (from 9 AM to 5 PM is 8 hours).\n\nWait, 9 AM to 5 PM is 8 hours? 9 AM to 12 PM is 3 hours, 12 PM to 5 PM is 5 hours, total 8.\n\nYes.\n\nBut if current time is 6 PM on Tuesday, then next Friday 5 PM would be 3 days minus 1 hour? Wait, no. If it's Tuesday 6 PM, then next Friday 5 PM is 2 days and 23 hours later.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute the number of days until next Friday (0-6 days), then set the time to 17:00.\n\nSo regardless of current time, the target is next Friday at 17:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current day of week (isoweekday).\n\n3. Compute days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. If 0, then 7.\n\nWait, current_day is 1 (Mon) to 7 (Sun).\n\nFriday is 5.\n\nSo days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If negative, add 7.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent_day=5", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
