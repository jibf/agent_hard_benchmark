The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current time isn't specified, I should probably get the current timestamp first. Wait, but there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give me the current POSIX time. Once I have that, I can calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. The user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So I need to convert that into a POSIX timestamp. To do that, I might need to know the current date and time. Let me check the available tools. There's get_current_timestamp which gives the current time. Then, using shift_timestamp, I can add one day to get tomorrow's date. But 5 PM is a specific time, so maybe I need to set the time to 17:00 (since it's 5 PM in 24-hour format).\n\nAlternatively, maybe use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But for that, I need the year, month, day, hour, etc. So first, get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then adjust the day to tomorrow and set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Increment the day by 1 (tomorrow). But need to handle month and year rollovers, but maybe the functions handle that.\n4. Set hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n5. Convert that datetime info back to a timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but there's a shift_timestamp function. Maybe after getting current timestamp, shift by 1 day and set the time to 17:00. Wait, shift_timestamp allows adding days, hours, etc. So if current time is, say, today at 10 AM, adding 1 day would make it tomorrow 10 AM. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So maybe shift by 1 day and then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nBut how to set the exact time? Maybe after shifting by 1 day, subtract the current hours, minutes, seconds and add 17 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, set day to tomorrow, hour to 17, etc., then convert back.\n\nLet me check the tools again. There's datetime_info_to_timestamp which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So if I can get the current date, add one day, set hour to 17, etc., then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current year, month, day, etc.\n- Increment day by 1 (tomorrow). But need to handle if day is last day of month, etc. However, the function might handle that, but since I'm generating the parameters, maybe I have to do it manually. Wait, no, the user is expecting tomorrow, so adding one day to current day. But if current day is 31st, adding one day would roll over to next month. However, since I don't have the current date, I need to get it first.\n\nWait, but maybe the shift_timestamp function can handle adding a day. Let's see: shift_timestamp takes a timestamp and deltas (weeks, days, hours, etc.). So if I take current timestamp, add 1 day, that gives me the same time tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time. So if current time is 10 AM today, adding 1 day would be 10 AM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM. So need to adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nHmm. So perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Shift by 1 day to get tomorrow's date at same time.\n3. Then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? Maybe convert the shifted timestamp to datetime info, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back.\n\nAlternatively, after shifting by 1 day, subtract the current hours, minutes, seconds and add 17 hours.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use datetime_info_to_timestamp. Let's try:\n\n- Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n- Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n- Increment day by 1.\n- Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if incrementing day goes beyond the month's days. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might handle that when converting back. Wait, no. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function expects valid date components. So if current day is 31, and month has 30 days, incrementing day would be invalid. But since the user says \"tomorrow\", the system should handle it correctly. However, since I'm generating the parameters, I need to ensure that the day is valid.\n\nBut perhaps the shift_timestamp function is better for adding days, as it handles rollovers. Let's see:\n\n- Current timestamp: T\n- Shift T by 1 day: T + 86400 seconds (1 day)\n- Then, get the datetime info of T+86400, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back.\n\nWait, but how to set the time to 17:00? Maybe:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Shift T by 1 day to get tomorrow same time (T1).\n3. Convert T1 to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, min, sec).\n4. Set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems feasible.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp.\n- Then call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n- Then modify the datetime info to day+1, hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\nWait, no. Wait, shifting by 1 day would already give tomorrow's date. Wait, no: if current time is today at 10 AM, shifting by 1 day gives tomorrow 10 AM. But user wants tomorrow 5 PM, so we need to set the time to 17:00 regardless of current time.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = current day +1.\n- Set hour=17, min=0, sec=0.\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle if current day is last day of month. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that, as it's a standard conversion. For example, if today is Jan 31, then day+1 would be Feb 1, which is valid.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info (timestamp_to_datetime_info).\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp (datetime_info_to_timestamp).\n\nThen use that timestamp as the reminder_timestamp.\n\nSo first, I need to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use that result in timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nThen, adjust the datetime info.\n\nThen, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the adjusted values.\n\nOnce I have the timestamp, I can call add_reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\", reminder_timestamp as calculated.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify location, latitude and longitude are optional, so we can omit them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp.\n- Then, use that to get datetime info.\n- Adjust day +1, set time to 17:00:00.\n- Convert to timestamp.\n- Add reminder with that timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant needs to make multiple function calls. However, each turn the assistant can make one or more tool calls. Wait, the problem says \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\"\n\nSo in this case, to compute the timestamp, I need to first get current timestamp, then convert to datetime info, then adjust, then convert back.\n\nBut the assistant has to make these calls step by step. However, in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to generate the necessary tool calls. But since the assistant can't execute the functions, it has to plan the sequence.\n\nWait, but the user is expecting the assistant to generate the correct function calls. However, the assistant can't know the current timestamp, so it has to call get_current_timestamp first.\n\nSo the first step is to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, based on the response (which we don't have), call timestamp_to_datetime_info with that timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant is generating the tool calls, it has to do them in sequence. However, in this scenario, the assistant can only make one set of tool calls per response. Wait, the problem says \"For each function call, return a json object...\". So if multiple function calls are needed, the assistant should output multiple tool_call entries.\n\nBut in reality, some functions depend on the output of previous", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "TEN_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
