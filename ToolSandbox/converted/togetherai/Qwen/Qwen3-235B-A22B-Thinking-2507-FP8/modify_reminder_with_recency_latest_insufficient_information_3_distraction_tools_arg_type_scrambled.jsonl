The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. First, I need to figure out what functions I can use here.\n\nHmm, the main task is modifying a reminder's time. So probably the modify_reminder function. But to do that, I need the reminder_id. The user didn't specify which reminder, so maybe I need to search for it first. The user says \"upcoming,\" so maybe the next one.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function can help find reminders. But how do I know which one is the upcoming one? Maybe I should search for reminders with a reminder_timestamp after the current time. But I need the current timestamp. Oh, but I don't have the current time. Wait, maybe I can calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a timestamp first.\n\nWait, the user says \"push to tomorrow 5PM\". So I need to get tomorrow's date at 5 PM as a POSIX timestamp. To do that, I might need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp. But for that, I need the year, month, day, etc. But how do I get tomorrow's date?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use shift_timestamp. If I can get the current timestamp, shift it by one day and set the time to 5 PM. But I don't have the current timestamp. Wait, maybe the system has access to the current time, but since I'm an AI, I don't. So perhaps the user expects me to assume the current date?\n\nWait, the problem says not to make assumptions. So maybe I need to ask for clarification, but the user hasn't provided enough info. Wait, but the instructions say if ambiguous, ask for clarification. However, the user's instruction here is to push the upcoming reminder to tomorrow 5PM. Maybe \"tomorrow\" is relative to the current day when the user is asking.\n\nBut since I can't know the current date, maybe I need to use the shift_timestamp function. Wait, but to shift, I need a base timestamp. Maybe first get the current timestamp via some other means? Wait, but there's no function to get the current time. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used if I assume today's date. But the user didn't specify the date, so maybe the system expects me to calculate tomorrow's date based on the current date. But since I don't have access to the current date, maybe the function shift_timestamp can help. Wait, the shift_timestamp requires a timestamp to shift. But if I don't have a starting timestamp, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the current time as the starting point. But since I can't get the current time, perhaps the system expects me to use the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp that's today's 00:00:00, but again, without knowing today's date, that's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to first find the upcoming reminder. So first call search_reminder to find the next reminder. But to search for upcoming, I need to set a lower bound on the reminder_timestamp as the current time. But without knowing the current time, how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The user wants to modify an upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n2. To modify, I need the reminder_id. So first, I need to find which reminder is the upcoming one.\n3. To search for upcoming reminders, I need to know the current timestamp to set as lower bound. But since I don't have current time, maybe the system expects me to assume that \"upcoming\" means the next one, so perhaps search without a timestamp and take the earliest one? But the search_reminder function allows for lower/upper bounds on reminder_timestamp.\n\nWait, maybe the search_reminder can be called with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to now. But again, without knowing now, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects that \"upcoming\" refers to the next reminder in time, so I need to find the reminder with the smallest reminder_timestamp that is greater than the current time. But since I can't get current time, maybe the system expects me to proceed by first getting the current timestamp via some method.\n\nWait, there's a function called timestamp_to_datetime_info, but that converts a timestamp to datetime info, not the other way. To get the current timestamp, perhaps the system expects me to use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date. But since I don't know the current date, this is impossible.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem expects me to assume that \"tomorrow\" is one day from the current day, and 5 PM is 17:00. So, to calculate tomorrow's 5 PM timestamp, I need to:\n\n- Get current date and time (but I can't)\n- Add one day, set time to 17:00:00\n\nBut without current date, how?\n\nWait, maybe the shift_timestamp function can be used. Suppose I have a reference timestamp. Wait, but I don't. Alternatively, maybe the system expects me to use the current time as the starting point, but since I can't get it, perhaps the function shift_timestamp can take a delta from now. But the function requires a timestamp parameter.\n\nThis is a problem. Maybe the correct approach is to first call search_reminder to find the upcoming reminder, but without knowing the current time, the search might not be accurate. However, the user says \"upcoming,\" which probably means the next one, so maybe search for all reminders and pick the one with the earliest reminder_timestamp that's in the future.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the current timestamp. Since I can't get it, perhaps the system expects me to assume that the current timestamp is available through some other means, but given the tools provided, maybe there's a way.\n\nWait, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp can be used if I assume today's date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then tomorrow is 2023-10-06. But since I don't know today's date, this is an assumption. However, the problem states not to make assumptions. So I shouldn't assume the current date.\n\nThis is a dilemma. The user's request is ambiguous because \"tomorrow\" depends on the current date, which isn't provided. But the problem says to ask for clarification if ambiguous. Wait, but the user instruction says \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nBut in this case, the user said \"Push my upcoming reminder to tomorrow 5PM.\" The ambiguity is what \"tomorrow\" refers to, but in common usage, it's the day after the current day. However, since the system doesn't have access to the current date, perhaps the correct action is to calculate tomorrow's date based on the current system time, but as an AI, I don't have that.\n\nWait, but maybe the tools provided can handle this. Let's see. The shift_timestamp function can shift a timestamp by days. If I could get the current timestamp, I could shift it by 1 day and set the time to 5 PM. But how to get the current timestamp?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects me to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. But since I don't know the current date, I can't. So perhaps the correct step is to first determine the current timestamp. Wait, but there's no function to get the current time.\n\nHmm. Maybe the intended approach is:\n\n1. Use search_reminder to find the upcoming reminder (assuming \"upcoming\" means the next one, so maybe the one with the smallest reminder_timestamp greater than now). But without knowing now, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has only one upcoming reminder, so search without parameters and take the first one. But the search_reminder function requires no parameters, so it would return all reminders. But the user says \"upcoming,\" so perhaps the next one.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's try to outline possible steps:\n\n- To modify the reminder, need reminder_id.\n- To get reminder_id, search for reminders that are upcoming. But how to define upcoming? Probably reminders where reminder_timestamp > current_time.\n- To get current_time, perhaps use datetime_info_to_timestamp with current date, but since I don't know current date, this is impossible.\n- Alternatively, maybe the system assumes that \"tomorrow\" is 24 hours from now, so shift the current time by 1 day and set to 5 PM. But again, without current time.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects that \"tomorrow 5PM\" is a specific time, so calculate that timestamp. For example, if today is Oct 5, 2023, tomorrow is Oct 6, 5PM. But without knowing today's date, how?\n\nWait, perhaps the shift_timestamp function can be used with a delta. Suppose the current time is T, then tomorrow 5PM is T + 1 day + (17 - current hour) hours, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is:\n\n1. Calculate the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM.\n   - To do this, need to know today's date, but since I can't, perhaps assume that \"tomorrow\" is 24 hours from the current time. But 5 PM might not be 24 hours later if current time is after 5 PM.\n\nWait, the user says \"push to tomorrow 5PM\", which implies that regardless of current time, set it to 5 PM of the next day.\n\nSo, for example, if today is Monday, and current time is Monday 3 PM, then tomorrow 5 PM is", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
