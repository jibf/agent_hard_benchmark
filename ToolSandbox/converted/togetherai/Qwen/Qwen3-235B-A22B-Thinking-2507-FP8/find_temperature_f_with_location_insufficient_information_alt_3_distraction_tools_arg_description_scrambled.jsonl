So they probably want the temperature in Fahrenheit. Let me check the tools provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the available functions: search_lat_lon, search_location_around_lat_lon, search_stock, search_holiday, unit_conversion. None of these directly fetch weather data. The user is asking for temperature, which isn't covered by any of the functions listed. The closest might be search_location_around_lat_lon, but that's for finding locations, not weather. The unit_conversion function can convert units, but without the current temperature value, it's not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to get the location's coordinates first? Like, use search_lat_lon to find the Grand Canyon's coordinates, but the function requires latitude and longitude as inputs, which I don't have. Alternatively, search_location_around_lat_lon with \"Grand Canyon\" as the location. Let me check that function's description. It says it can search for a location around a lat/lon, but if lat/lon aren't provided, it defaults to current location. However, the user is asking about the Grand Canyon specifically. So maybe call search_location_around_lat_lon with location set to \"Grand Canyon\" to get its coordinates. But even then, the function returns location info like name, address, etc., not weather. \n\nHmm, the problem is none of the tools can retrieve temperature data. The user might not realize that. Since the tools don't include a weather API, I can't get the temperature. But the user also mentioned they can't read Celsius, so maybe they want a conversion. But without the current temp value, conversion isn't possible. \n\nWait, maybe the user is assuming that the location search would include temperature, but according to the tool descriptions, the search_location_around_lat_lon returns things like business hours, address, etc., but not weather. So there's no way to get the temperature with the provided tools. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't retrieve the temperature and that none of the available functions can help with that request. But the user might have thought that converting units is needed, but without the actual temp value, conversion isn't applicable here.\n\nSo the correct response is to state that the current tools don't support fetching temperature data, so I can't provide that information. But let me double-check all functions again. Search_stock is for stocks, search_holiday for holidays, unit_conversion for units. None related to weather. So yes, no function available. Therefore, I should explain that I can't access real-time temperature data and the available tools don't support this request.\n</think>\n\nThe functions provided do not include access to real-time weather data or temperature information. I cannot retrieve the current temperature at the Grand Canyon or perform unit conversions for temperature without an initial value. Would you like me to help with something else that can be addressed using the available tools?", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
