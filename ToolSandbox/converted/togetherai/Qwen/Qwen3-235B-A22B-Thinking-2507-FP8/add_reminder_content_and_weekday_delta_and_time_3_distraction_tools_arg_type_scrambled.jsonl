Let me figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. Since the user didn't specify a time zone, I'll assume it's the user's current time zone. But the functions available don't mention time zones, so maybe POSIX timestamp is in UTC? Hmm, but the problem might not require time zone conversion. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nI need to find out when \"next Friday\" is. Today's date is important here. To get the current timestamp, I should call get_current_timestamp. That will give me the current time in POSIX format. Then, using timestamp_to_datetime_info, I can convert that to get the current day of the week.\n\nWait, the functions available include timestamp_to_datetime_info, which gives isoweekday (1-7, where Monday is 1). So first, get the current timestamp, then check what day it is today.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current day of the week (isoweekday).\n3. Calculate how many days until next Friday. If today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. Otherwise, compute the difference.\n4. Once the date is determined, set the time to 5 PM (17:00 in 24h format).\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n6. Then call add_reminder with the content and the calculated timestamp.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the date calculation? Let's think.\n\nSuppose today is Monday (isoweekday 1). Next Friday is in 4 days. If today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later. If today is Saturday (6), next Friday is 6 days later (since Friday is day 5, so 5 - 6 + 7 = 6 days). Wait, the formula for days until next Friday: (5 - current_weekday + 7) % 7. If current_weekday is 5 (Friday), then (5-5 +7)%7 =7%7=0, so 7 days later. So days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) % 7. If result is 0, add 7 days.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nCurrent day | isoweekday | days until next Friday\nMonday      | 1          | 4 (Fri - Mon = 4)\nTuesday     | 2          | 3\nWednesday   | 3          | 2\nThursday    | 4          | 1\nFriday      | 5          | 7 (since \"next\" Friday)\nSaturday    | 6          | 6 (Fri is 5, so 5 -6 = -1 +7=6)\nSunday      | 7          | 5 (5 -7 = -2 +7=5)\n\nYes, so days_to_add = (5 - current_weekday + 7) % 7. If 0, then 7.\n\nBut how to compute this? Once I have current_weekday from timestamp_to_datetime_info, I can calculate the days to add.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current weekday.\n3. Calculate days to next Friday.\n4. Then, set the time to 17:00 on that day.\n5. Convert that date/time to timestamp.\n\nBut how to adjust the timestamp? Maybe after getting current timestamp, shift it by the calculated days and set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has the current time. So first, get current datetime info to know the current day and time.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, etc.).\n- Determine how many days to add to reach next Friday.\n- Then, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the date calculation? For example, if today is Thursday, add 1 day to get to Friday. But if it's Friday, add 7 days.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date/time details.\n3. Calculate days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If days_to_add is 0, set to 7.\n4. Then, the target date is current date + days_to_add days.\n5. Set time to 17:00:00.\n6. Convert that target date/time to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nWait, but datetime_info_to_timestamp requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So after calculating the target date (current year, month, day + days_to_add), we can construct those parameters.\n\nBut how to handle month/year rollover? For example, if current day is 30th of a month with 31 days, adding 7 days would go to next month. But since the function datetime_info_to_timestamp can handle that, perhaps we need to compute the correct year, month, day.\n\nBut the problem is that the assistant can't compute that directly; it needs to use the functions provided. Wait, noâ€”the assistant has to figure out the parameters to pass to datetime_info_to_timestamp. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use shift_timestamp. Once we have the current timestamp, shift it by the required days and set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shift_timestamp can add days, but then how to set the exact time?\n\nAnother approach: get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, calculate the target date as current date + days_to_add, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut to compute the target date, the assistant needs to handle date arithmetic, which might be complex. However, the assistant can use shift_timestamp to adjust the days, but then also adjust the time.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T0).\n- Convert T0 to datetime info (D0).\n- Calculate days_to_add as (5 - D0.isoweekday +7) %7. If 0, days_to_add=7.\n- Then, the target date is D0 + days_to_add days.\n- Now, the target time is 17:00:00 on that date.\n- So, take T0, shift it by days_to_add days, then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? Because shifting by days will keep the same time of day. For example, if current time is 10 AM, shifting by 2 days will be 10 AM two days later. But we need 5 PM on that day.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days (so it's the same time on the target day).\n- Then, calculate the difference between 17:00 and the current hour, and shift accordingly.\n\nWait, but this might be complicated. Alternatively, after getting the target date (year, month, day), set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with current_ts to get current_year, current_month, current_day, current_hour, etc.\n3. Calculate days_to_add = (5 - current_isoweekday +7) %7. If 0, days_to_add=7.\n4. Compute target_day = current_day + days_to_add.\n   - But need to handle month/year rollover. However, the assistant can't do this directly, so perhaps use shift_timestamp to get the correct date.\n\nWait, maybe better to use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days to current_ts, which will handle the rollover correctly. Then, from that shifted timestamp, extract the date (year, month, day), set the time to 17:00:00, and convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Use shift_timestamp to add days_to_add days to current_ts. Let's call this shifted_ts.\n- Convert shifted_ts to datetime_info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info), which gives year, month, day, but the hour is same as current time.\n- Then, create a new datetime_info where hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nYes, this seems feasible.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T0).\n2. Convert T0 to datetime info (D0) to get current_isoweekday.\n3. Calculate days_to_add = (5 - D0.isoweekday +7) %7. If 0, days_to_add=7.\n4. Shift T0 by days_to_add days to get T1 (same time on next Friday).\n5. Convert T1 to datetime_info (D1) to get year, month, day.\n6. Create new datetime_info with D1.year, D1.month, D1.day, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n7. Convert that to timestamp T2 using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n8. Call add_reminder with content and T2.\n\nBut to do this, the assistant needs to make several tool calls.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, call timestamp_to", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
