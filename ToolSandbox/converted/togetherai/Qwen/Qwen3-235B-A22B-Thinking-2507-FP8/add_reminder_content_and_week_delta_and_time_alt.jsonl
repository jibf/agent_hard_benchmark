The user wants to add a todo to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the POSIX timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. But wait, I don't know the current date and time. So maybe I should use the get_current_timestamp function to find out the current time first. Once I have the current timestamp, I can calculate tomorrow's date and time.\n\nWait, but there's another function called datetime_info_to_timestamp that converts date and time info into a timestamp. But to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, etc. So maybe I need to get the current timestamp first, then convert it to datetime info to find out what tomorrow is.\n\nAlternatively, the get_current_timestamp will give me the current POSIX time. Then I can add 24 hours (which is 86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's same time, but the user said 5 PM tomorrow. Wait, but if it's currently, say, 6 PM today, then tomorrow at 5 PM would be 23 hours from now. Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is to get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, then adjust the day and hour accordingly. Let me think.\n\nThe user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So regardless of the current time, tomorrow at 5 PM. So first, get the current timestamp. Then, convert that to datetime info to know today's date. Then, increment the day by 1, set the hour to 17 (since 5 PM is 17 in 24h format), minutes to 0, seconds to 0. Then convert that datetime info back to a timestamp.\n\nBut to do that, I need to use get_current_timestamp first. Let me check the available functions.\n\nYes, there's get_current_timestamp which requires no parameters. So first step: call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current date and time components. Then, adjust the day to tomorrow, set hour to 17, etc.\n\nWait, but the user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if today is, say, October 5th, then tomorrow is October 6th at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Add 1 day to the day component. But need to handle month and year rollovers, like if it's the 31st of a month, adding a day would go to next month. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might handle that when converting back, but since we're manually adjusting, maybe it's safer to use the timestamp arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, since POSIX timestamps are in seconds, adding 86400 seconds (24 hours) would get to the same time tomorrow. But if the user wants exactly 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time, perhaps adding 86400 seconds might not be accurate if the current time is after 5 PM. Wait, no: if it's 6 PM today, then 5 PM tomorrow is 23 hours later. So adding 24 hours would be 6 PM tomorrow, which is not what the user wants.\n\nAh, right. So the correct approach is to calculate tomorrow's date at 5 PM. So regardless of current time, set the time to 17:00:00 on the next day.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Get current datetime info (year, month, day, hour, etc.)\n- If current time is past 5 PM today, then tomorrow is current day +1, else maybe same day? Wait, no: \"tomorrow\" means the next day, regardless of current time. So even if it's 4 PM today, tomorrow 5 PM is 25 hours from now. Wait, no: tomorrow is the next day. So if today is Monday, tomorrow is Tuesday. So regardless of current time, tomorrow at 5 PM is the next day's 5 PM.\n\nSo the correct way is: take current date, add one day, set time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut to compute that, we need to know the current date. So:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current POSIX time.\n2. Convert that to datetime_info to get current year, month, day, etc.\n3. Increment the day by 1. If day exceeds the number of days in the month, adjust month and year accordingly. But this is error-prone. However, since we can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, perhaps after adjusting the day, we can convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, but the datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So if we take the current datetime info, add 1 to the day, set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0, then call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nBut we need to handle cases where adding a day rolls over to the next month or year. For example, if today is January 31, adding a day would be February 1. But the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle that correctly as long as the input parameters are valid (e.g., month=2, day=1).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info.\n- Set day = current day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with these new values.\n\nBut wait, what if the current day is the last day of the month? For example, current day is 31, month is 1 (January). Adding 1 day would make it 32, which is invalid. But if we instead increment the month and set day to 1. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function might handle invalid dates by normalizing them, but we can't assume that. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the timestamp arithmetic: current timestamp + 86400 seconds (24 hours) would give the same time tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM tomorrow, which may not be 24 hours from now.\n\nWait, no. The user said \"tomorrow 5PM\". So if it's currently 3 PM on Monday, tomorrow 5 PM is 26 hours from now. If it's 6 PM on Monday, tomorrow 5 PM is 23 hours from now.\n\nSo the correct timestamp is: today's date at 00:00:00 + 1 day + 17 hours.\n\nAlternatively, take the current date, set the time to 17:00:00, then if that time is in the past (i.e., current time is after 5 PM), add 1 day.\n\nBut how to determine that? Let's see:\n\nSuppose current datetime is 2023-10-05 18:00:00 (6 PM). Tomorrow 5 PM is 2023-10-06 17:00:00. So we need to set the date to 2023-10-06, time 17:00:00.\n\nIf current datetime is 2023-10-05 14:00:00 (2 PM), then tomorrow 5 PM is 2023-10-06 17:00:00.\n\nSo regardless of current time, \"tomorrow 5 PM\" is always the next day at 17:00:00.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\n- Get current datetime info.\n- Set day = current day +1\n- Set hour =17, minute=0, second=0\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle cases where current day +1 exceeds days in month.\n\nHowever, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should accept the adjusted day, month, etc., and handle the rollover. For example, if current date is 2023-01-31, then day+1=32, but month is 1. But datetime_info_to_timestamp would likely throw an error if given invalid date. So perhaps a better way is to use the current timestamp, add 86400 seconds (24 hours), then adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, adding 24 hours to current timestamp gives the same time tomorrow. Then, if the current time is, say, 10 AM, adding 24 hours gives 10 AM tomorrow. But we need 5 PM tomorrow. So perhaps:\n\ncurrent_timestamp + ( (17 - current_hour) * 3600 - current_minute *60 - current_second ) + 86400 ?\n\nNo, that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Calculate the timestamp for today at 5 PM. If that's in the past, add 24 hours.\n\nBut the user said \"tomorrow\", so it's always the next day's 5 PM, regardless of current time.\n\nSo regardless of current time, it's (current date + 1 day) at 17:00:00.\n\nTherefore, steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime_info to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4.
