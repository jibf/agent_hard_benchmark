The user wants to push their upcoming reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM. Hmm, first I need to figure out what functions I can use here.\n\nThe available tools include modifying a reminder (reminder_1), searching for reminders (reminder_3), converting datetime to POSIX (utilities_1), getting current timestamp (utilities_2), shifting timestamps (utilities_5), calculating differences (utilities_6), converting timestamp to datetime info (utilities_7), and unit conversion (utilities_8).\n\nThe main task is to update a reminder's time. So first, I need to find the reminder. The user says \"upcoming reminder,\" which probably means the next one. So I should search for reminders that are upcoming. But to modify it, I need the reminder_id.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify which reminder, so maybe I need to search for the upcoming one first. Let's check the functions. Reminder_3 can search based on criteria. But what's the current time? I need the current timestamp to determine what's upcoming.\n\nSo first step: get the current POSIX timestamp using utilities_2. Then, maybe find reminders where reminder_timestamp is after the current time. But the user says \"upcoming,\" so maybe the next one. But how to get the reminder_id?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has only one upcoming reminder, but I can't assume that. The correct approach is to first search for reminders that are upcoming, then pick the relevant one (maybe the next one), then modify it.\n\nWait, but the user says \"push my upcoming reminder to tomorrow 5PM\". So \"upcoming\" might refer to the next one. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Calculate tomorrow 5PM as a timestamp. Tomorrow is current day +1, 5PM is 17:00.\n   - To get tomorrow's date, maybe use utilities_5 to shift current timestamp by 1 day, but set the time to 17:00. Wait, but how to set the exact time?\n   - Alternatively, get current timestamp, convert to datetime (utilities_7), then add 1 day, set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert back to timestamp using utilities_1. But that's more steps.\n\nWait, maybe first get current timestamp (utilities_2), then use utilities_5 to shift by 1 day, but also adjust the time to 17:00. Wait, utilities_5 shifts by deltas, but if the current time is, say, 10 AM today, shifting by 1 day would make it 10 AM tomorrow. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So perhaps better to calculate tomorrow 5 PM as a specific date.\n\nSo steps for the new timestamp:\n\n- Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n- Convert to datetime (utilities_7) to get today's date.\n- Add 1 day to get tomorrow's date.\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that datetime to POSIX timestamp using utilities_1.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, get current timestamp, use utilities_5 to add 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00. Wait, but utilities_5 shifts the entire timestamp by the deltas. So if current time is 14:00 (2 PM) today, adding 1 day would be 14:00 tomorrow. To get to 17:00 tomorrow, need to add 1 day and 3 hours. But the user says \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is 17:00, so regardless of current time, it's the next day at 17:00.\n\nWait, but \"tomorrow\" is relative. If today is Monday, tomorrow is Tuesday. So need to calculate the date of tomorrow, set time to 17:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp (utilities_2). Let's call that current_ts.\n\nThen, convert current_ts to datetime components (utilities_7). That gives year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, add 1 day to the day. But need to handle month/year rollover. However, utilities_5 can handle shifting by days correctly. Wait, maybe better to use utilities_5 to shift current_ts by 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, no. Shifting by 1 day would take current_ts + 86400 seconds (assuming no DST), but that would set the time to the same hour. For example, if current time is 10 AM today, +1 day is 10 AM tomorrow. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, need to add 1 day and 7 hours (if current time is 10 AM). But the user just says \"tomorrow 5PM\", which is a specific time, not relative to current time.\n\nAh, right. So regardless of when the user asks, \"tomorrow 5PM\" means the next day at 17:00. So if today is Monday, 5PM, and user says \"push to tomorrow 5PM\", it's Tuesday 5PM. But if user asks on Monday at 6PM, \"tomorrow 5PM\" is Tuesday 5PM.\n\nSo the correct approach is to determine tomorrow's date, set time to 17:00, then convert to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Convert to datetime (utilities_7) to get current date components.\n3. Add 1 day to the date (using utilities_5 on the timestamp? Or adjust the components).\nWait, maybe better to:\n\n- Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n- Use utilities_5 to add 1 day to current timestamp. This gives tomorrow's same time.\n- Then, adjust the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nBut how to adjust the time? Because utilities_5 shifts by deltas, but if we have a timestamp for tomorrow at current hour, we need to subtract the current hour, minute, second and add 17 hours.\n\nAlternatively, take the timestamp from step 1, convert to datetime components (utilities_7), increment day by 1, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp (utilities_1).\n\nYes, that seems more precise.\n\nSo:\n\n- Call utilities_2 to get current_ts.\n- Call utilities_7 with current_ts to get year, month, day, hour, etc.\n- Then, create a new date: year, month, day+1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n- But need to handle day overflow (e.g., day 31 +1 becomes next month). However, the utilities_1 function probably handles that when converting the date components to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current timestamp via utilities_2.\n2. Convert to datetime components via utilities_7.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp via utilities_1 with the new components.\n\nBut wait, the user might have said \"tomorrow\" which is +1 day from today, regardless of current time. So even if it's 11 PM today, tomorrow is next day at 17:00.\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nOnce we have the new timestamp for tomorrow 5PM, we need to find the upcoming reminder to modify.\n\nBut first, we need to identify which reminder to modify. The user says \"my upcoming reminder\", which likely refers to the next upcoming one. So we need to search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is after current time, and find the one with the smallest reminder_timestamp (the next one).\n\nSo steps:\n\na. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\nb. Search reminders with reminder_timestamp >= current_ts (using reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current_ts).\nc. From the results, pick the reminder with the earliest reminder_timestamp (the next upcoming one).\nd. Modify that reminder's reminder_timestamp to the new timestamp (tomorrow 5PM).\n\nBut the problem is, the assistant can't do multiple tool calls in one response. Wait, the instructions say: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\" So the assistant may need to make multiple tool calls step by step.\n\nBut the user's message is a single request, so the assistant should figure out the necessary steps and make the appropriate tool calls.\n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided the reminder_id, so the first step is to search for the upcoming reminder.\n\nWait, but the first tool call should be to get the current timestamp, then search for reminders.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, for each turn, the assistant can make one or more tool calls. Wait, the instructions say: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So in one response, the assistant can make multiple tool calls.\n\nBut let's structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, need current timestamp to know what \"upcoming\" means.\n\nSo first tool call: utilities_2 to get current_ts.\n\nThen, use that current_ts to search for reminders with reminder_timestamp >= current_ts (using reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound = current_ts).\n\nBut since we can't chain tool calls in one response (the assistant has to make one set of tool calls per response), perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So in one response", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
