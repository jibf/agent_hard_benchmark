Let me check what tools I have available. There's the search_messages function. It requires parameters like message_id, sender info, recipient info, content, or timestamps.\n\nBut the user didn't specify any details. They just said \"I wanna find a message.\" So I need to ask for more information. What exactly are they looking for? Maybe the message content, who sent it, when it was sent, etc.\n\nI can't call the search function without specific criteria. The function allows multiple parameters, but without any values, it's impossible to proceed. I should prompt the user to provide more details like sender's name, phone number, keywords in the message, or time range.\n\nWait, the instructions say not to make assumptions. So I shouldn't guess any values. I have to ask for clarification. Let me check the tools again. The search_messages function has optional parameters, but without any provided, the search would return all messages, which might not be helpful. But the user probably has a specific message in mind.\n\nSo the correct step is to ask the user to specify which message they're looking for by providing details like sender, recipient, content, or time. That way, I can use the search_messages function with the right parameters.\n</think>\n\nTo help you find the message, I'll need more details. Could you please specify:\n- Who sent or received the message? (e.g., name, phone number)\n- Any keywords in the message content?\n- Approximate time it was sent? (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last week\")\n\nThis will help narrow down the search.", "turn_idx": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Nah, I don't have any more details."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to find a message but doesn't have any details. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the available functions include search_messages, which requires parameters like message_id, sender info, content, timestamps, etc. But the user said they don't have any more details. So none of the specific fields are provided.\n\nWait, the user initially said \"I wanna find a message\" and when asked for more info, they replied \"Nah, I don't have any more details.\" So they can't provide sender, content, time, etc.\n\nBut the search_messages function allows all parameters to be optional. If no parameters are given, would it return all messages? But maybe the system expects some criteria. However, the user has no info, so maybe the function can be called without any arguments to retrieve all messages. But the problem is, without any criteria, the search might return too many results or not be allowed.\n\nWait, looking at the function definition: \"required\": [] for search_messages parameters. So it's possible to call it with no arguments. But the description says \"Search results contains all contact entries that matched all criteria\" — if there are no criteria, maybe it returns all messages. However, the user might not want all messages, but they don't have any details. \n\nBut the user's request is ambiguous. They want to find a message but have no details. Maybe the assistant should inform them that without any criteria, it's impossible to search, or perhaps retrieve all messages. However, the system might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should ask again for clarification, but the user already said they don't have more details.\n\nWait, the user's last message is \"Nah, I don't have any more details.\" So the assistant needs to handle that. Since there's no info, perhaps the only option is to call search_messages with no parameters, which might return all messages. But the user might not want that. However, given the tools available, that's the only function that can be used here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should explain that without any details, it's not possible to search, but the user might expect the system to try something. Let me check the function's description again: \"Search for a message based on provided arguments Each field has a search criteria...\" So if no arguments are provided, does it return all messages? The description says \"matched all criteria\" — if there are no criteria, then all messages match. So calling search_messages with no parameters would return all messages.\n\nBut the user probably doesn't want all messages. However, since they have no details, maybe that's the only option. The assistant should probably inform the user that without any criteria, it will retrieve all messages, which might be too many, but proceed if that's what they want.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't given any parameters, so the assistant needs to decide whether to call the function or not. Since the user insists they have no details, the assistant might have to call search_messages with no arguments. But maybe the system expects that, even if it's not useful. Alternatively, the assistant could explain that without any information, a search isn't feasible.\n\nBut according to the problem statement: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nIn this case, the user's request is ambiguous because they want to find a message but provide no details. The assistant should ask for clarification. Wait, but the user already said they don't have more details. So the assistant has to respond based on that.\n\nWait, the initial response from the assistant was to ask for more details. The user replied they don't have any. So now the assistant needs to handle that. The correct action here is to inform the user that without any criteria, it's impossible to perform a meaningful search, and perhaps suggest that they might need to provide at least some information. However, since the user insists they don't have any, maybe the assistant should state that and not call any function.\n\nBut the problem says: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" If there's no information, maybe no function should be called. However, the search_messages function can be called with no parameters, which would return all messages. But is that helpful?\n\nThe user's intent is to \"find a message,\" but without any details, it's unclear which message. So the assistant should probably explain that without additional information, it's not possible to narrow down the search, and perhaps the user needs to provide at least some criteria. However, since the user says they don't have any, the assistant might have to respond that they can't help without more details.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nIn this case, the user's request is ambiguous because they want to find a message but provide no details. The assistant should ask for clarification. However, the user already said they don't have more details, so maybe the assistant should state that without any information, a search can't be performed.\n\nWait, but the user's last message is \"Nah, I don't have any more details.\" So the assistant has to respond to that. The correct response would be to explain that without any criteria, it's impossible to search, and perhaps suggest that they might need to recall some details. However, since the user insists they don't have any, the assistant can't proceed with a search.\n\nBut the problem requires that if the user request is ambiguous, ask for clarification. However, the user already clarified that they don't have more details. So now the assistant has to handle that. Maybe the answer is to inform the user that without any information, the search can't be done, and no function is called.\n\nBut the tools include search_messages which can be called with no parameters. However, calling it would return all messages, which is probably not what the user wants. But the user might not know that. So the assistant should explain that and ask if they want to proceed with a search for all messages.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the assistant should not make assumptions. So if the user doesn't provide any parameters, the assistant shouldn't assume to call search_messages with no args. Instead, since the request is ambiguous (user wants to find a message but has no details), the assistant should ask for clarification. But the user already said they don't have details, so maybe the assistant has to respond that it's not possible.\n\nHmm. Let me check the initial instructions again: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because they want to find a message but provide no criteria. The assistant should ask for clarification. However, the user has already stated they don't have more details. So the assistant's next step is to explain that without any information, a search isn't feasible.\n\nIn this case, the correct response is to inform the user that without additional details, it's impossible to perform the search, and perhaps suggest that they might need to provide at least some information. Since there's no function that can be called meaningfully here (calling search_messages with no args would return all messages, which isn't helpful), the assistant shouldn't call any function and instead explain the situation.\n\nTherefore, the assistant should respond with a message explaining the issue, rather than calling a function.\n</think>\n\nWithout any details such as sender/receiver information, keywords, or timeframes, it's not possible to perform a meaningful search. The system requires at least one criterion to narrow down results — otherwise, it would return *all* messages, which likely isn't helpful.\n\nLet me know if you can recall even a small detail (e.g., \"it was sent recently\" or \"it had a photo\"), and I'll try again!", "turn_idx": 2}, {"role": "user", "content": "I really can't help with more details."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_6wy1mqzrknnn6lqgiy3z8nr0", "function": {"arguments": "{}", "name": "search_messages"}, "type": "function"}], "turn_idx": 3}, {"tool_call_id": "call_6wy1mqzrknnn6lqgiy3z8nr0", "role": "tool", "name": "search_messages", "content": "ValueError: No search criteria are given.

The user wants to find a message but doesn't have any details. They said they can't provide more info. I tried calling search_messages with no arguments, but it threw an error because no criteria were given.\n\nHmm, the error message says at least one search criteria is needed. So the system can't handle an empty search. The user might not realize that without any filters, it's impossible. But they're insistent.\n\nMaybe I should explain again why it's not possible. The function requires at least one parameter like sender, content, or timestamp. Since they can't give any, maybe suggest a default? Wait, the tools don't have a default. The search_messages function needs at least one field.\n\nWait, the user might not know that even a vague time like \"recent\" could help. But they said they really can't help with more details. So perhaps the only option is to inform them that without any criteria, the system can't proceed. But the error already happened when I tried an empty search.\n\nI should respond that without any details, it's impossible, and maybe give an example of what's needed. Like, even if they remember it was today, I could use current timestamp. But they said no. So maybe just state clearly that the system requires at least one criterion and list possible options again.\n</think>\n\nWithout any search criteria (e.g., sender, recipient, keywords, or timeframe), the system cannot perform a meaningful search. Even basic filters like \"messages from today\" or \"containing the word 'hello'\" would help narrow results.\n\nIf you truly have *no details at all*, the only option would be to return **all messages**—but this is likely impractical (e.g., thousands of results). Let me know if you can provide even a tiny clue! 😊", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "I really can't provide anything more."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to handle this. The user keeps saying they can't provide any more details to search for a message. They've tried a few times, and each time the system says it needs at least one criterion.\n\nFirst, the user initially asked to find a message but didn't give any specifics. The assistant asked for more details like sender, keywords, or time. The user said they don't have more details. Then the assistant explained that without criteria, it's impossible, but the user still insists they can't help.\n\nNext, the assistant tried calling search_messages with no arguments, but that caused an error because the function requires at least one search parameter. The error message said \"No search criteria are given.\"\n\nNow, the user is again saying they really can't provide anything more. The assistant needs to respond appropriately. Since the system can't perform a search without any criteria, the assistant should probably explain again why it's necessary and maybe suggest the only possible option, which is to return all messages, even though that's not practical.\n\nWait, but the user might not realize that returning all messages isn't feasible. Maybe the assistant should clarify that without any filters, the system would have to retrieve every single message, which could be a huge number and not useful. Also, maybe there's a default behavior if no criteria are given, but according to the function definition, the search_messages function requires at least one parameter. The error message confirmed that.\n\nSo the correct response is to inform the user that it's impossible without any criteria and that they need to provide at least one detail. But the user is insisting they can't. Maybe the assistant should offer to show recent messages as a default, but the function doesn't have a default parameter. Wait, looking back at the tools, the search_messages function has optional parameters, but the error says at least one is required.\n\nHmm. The assistant can't make up criteria, but maybe suggest using the current timestamp to get recent messages. For example, if the user says \"recent,\" but they haven't specified. Wait, the user hasn't given any timeframe, but maybe the assistant can use get_current_timestamp and set a lower bound to, say, 24 hours ago. But the user hasn't agreed to that.\n\nWait, the user's last message is \"I really can't provide anything more.\" So the assistant has to respond without making assumptions. The previous attempt to call search_messages with no args failed. So the correct response is to state clearly that without any criteria, the search can't be performed, and perhaps explain the consequences of not having criteria (like returning all messages, which is not feasible).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can suggest a default search, like messages from the last day, but that would require making an assumption, which the initial instructions say not to do. The user hasn't specified \"recent,\" so assuming that might not be right.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo the assistant shouldn't assume a timeframe. Therefore, the correct response is to reiterate that at least one criterion is needed and that without it, the search can't proceed. Maybe also explain why, to help the user understand.\n\nIn the previous response, the assistant mentioned that returning all messages is impractical. So now, the assistant should probably just state again that it's impossible and perhaps offer to help if the user can recall even a small detail, even if they think it's insignificant.\n\nSo the next step is to respond with a message explaining that without any criteria, the search can't be done, and maybe give an example of a minimal criterion they could provide, like \"from today\" or \"to a specific number,\" even if the user thinks they don't have it.\n</think>\n\nWithout **any** search criteria (not even a single keyword, timestamp, or contact detail), the system cannot execute a query—it would require returning *every message ever sent*, which is technically possible but practically useless (e.g., millions of results). \n\nThis is like asking a librarian to \"find a book\" without specifying *any* details—they’d have to hand you the entire library. 😅\n\nIf you’re certain you have **zero details**, the only option is to abort the search.
