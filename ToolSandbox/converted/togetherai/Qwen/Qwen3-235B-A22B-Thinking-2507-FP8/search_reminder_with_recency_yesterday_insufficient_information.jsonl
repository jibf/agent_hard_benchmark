Since the user didn't specify a time zone, I'll assume they mean their local time, but the system probably uses UTC. However, the functions available don't mention time zones, so maybe the timestamps are in UTC. But the main issue is converting \"yesterday\" into a timestamp range.\n\nTo find reminders from yesterday, I need the start and end timestamps of yesterday. Let's say today is October 5, 2023. Then yesterday would be October 4, 2023. The start timestamp would be 00:00:00 UTC on October 4, and the end would be 23:59:59 UTC on October 4.\n\nBut how do I get those timestamps? The user hasn't provided the current date, so I need to calculate it. Wait, the functions available include timestamp_to_datetime_info, which can convert a timestamp to date parts, but I don't have a current timestamp. Alternatively, maybe I can use the shift_timestamp function to get yesterday's date relative to the current time. But wait, the current time isn't provided. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the user is asking about \"yesterday,\" so I need to figure out the timestamp range for yesterday. Since the system might not have access to the current time, perhaps I need to assume that the current time is now, but as an AI, I don't have real-time data. However, the functions provided might expect that the current timestamp is known. Wait, noâ€”the functions are tools the assistant can call, but the assistant itself doesn't have the current time. So maybe the assistant needs to calculate the timestamps based on some reference.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a delta to get yesterday's start and end times. But to do that, it needs a base timestamp. Since the user is asking about yesterday, the base would be the current time. But without knowing the current timestamp, how can the assistant compute it?\n\nThis is a bit of a catch-22. The assistant doesn't have access to the current time, but the user is asking about yesterday. Maybe the assistant should first get the current timestamp using some method, but the available tools don't include a function to get the current time. The timestamp_to_datetime_info function converts a given timestamp to datetime info, but it needs a timestamp as input.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can assume that the current timestamp is known through some other means, but since it's not provided, maybe the assistant needs to ask for clarification. However, the user's question is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which the assistant doesn't have.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\" So the user's request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" isn't defined without knowing the current date. But the assistant is supposed to use the tools provided. However, the tools don't include a way to get the current time. Therefore, the assistant can't compute yesterday's timestamp range without additional information.\n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a delta from a hypothetical current timestamp. But without knowing the current timestamp, it can't compute the exact values. For example, if the current timestamp is T, then yesterday's start would be T minus 24 hours, but adjusted to midnight. However, without knowing T, the assistant can't calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should first call timestamp_to_datetime_info on the current time, but again, it doesn't have the current timestamp. This seems like a dead end.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant is supposed to realize that to find reminders from yesterday, it needs to set the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound to the start and end of yesterday. But to get those timestamps, it needs to calculate them. Since the assistant can't get the current time, maybe it should use the shift_timestamp function with a delta from now, but since it doesn't have 'now', it's stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant should assume that the current timestamp is available through some other means, but according to the problem statement, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. Therefore, the correct action is to ask for clarification because the user's request is ambiguous without knowing the current date or the timezone.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\" So the user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" isn't specific enough without context. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the current date as reference. But since the assistant can't know the current date (as it's not provided), it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, but in real-world scenarios, assistants do have access to the current time. Maybe in this context, the assistant is supposed to assume that it can get the current timestamp, but the tools don't include a function for that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a delta to calculate yesterday's start and end times relative to the current time, but since it doesn't have the current time, it can't. Therefore, the assistant needs to ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for reminders from yesterday. To search for reminders, the search_reminder function requires timestamp ranges. So the assistant needs to set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound to yesterday's start and end.\n\nTo compute those, the assistant would need to:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp (but no function for that).\n2. Shift it back by 1 day to get yesterday's date.\n3. Set the lowerbound to the start of yesterday (midnight) and upperbound to the end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nBut without the current timestamp, step 1 is impossible. Therefore, the assistant can't compute the necessary timestamps and should ask for clarification.\n\nHowever, maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a hypothetical current timestamp, but it doesn't have one. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant is expected to use the current time as known, but since it's not provided, it's an assumption.\n\nGiven the instructions not to make assumptions, the correct response is to ask for clarification. But the problem says to use the tools if possible. Wait, but the user's query is ambiguous, so according to the instructions, the assistant should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user's message is \"What's on my reminder yesterday?\" which is a common query. In practice, assistants assume the current date. Maybe in this context, the assistant is supposed to proceed under the assumption that it can calculate yesterday's timestamps, perhaps by using the current time as known.\n\nBut how? Let's think differently. Maybe the assistant can call timestamp_to_datetime_info with a placeholder timestamp, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should first call shift_timestamp with a delta to get yesterday's start and end.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n- Assume that \"yesterday\" refers to the entire day before today. To get the start of yesterday, we need to take the current time, subtract one day, and set the time to 00:00:00. Similarly, the end would be 23:59:59.\n\nBut to do that, the assistant needs the current timestamp. Since it's not provided, perhaps the assistant should generate the current timestamp as part of the process. However, the tools don't include a function to get the current time.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with a delta of 0 to get the current timestamp, but that's not how it works. The shift_timestamp function shifts a given timestamp, but you need to provide the base timestamp.\n\nThis is tricky. Given the constraints, perhaps the assistant should proceed by calculating the timestamps for yesterday based on the current date, assuming that the current timestamp is available. But since it's not, maybe the assistant is supposed to use a placeholder or realize it can't and ask for clarification.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nThe user's request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" isn't defined without knowing the current date. Therefore, the correct action is to ask for clarification. However, the user might expect the assistant to use the current date as reference. But according to the instructions, if it's ambiguous, ask for clarification.\n\nBut in many cases, \"yesterday\" is relative to the current day, so maybe it's not ambiguous. The assistant should proceed under the assumption that \"yesterday\" refers to the day before today, and calculate the timestamps accordingly.\n\nAssuming that the current timestamp is known (even though the assistant doesn't have it), but since the tools don't provide a way to get it, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the shift_timestamp function with a delta from a hypothetical current time.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the current timestamp. Since it's not provided, but in reality, the system would have it. However, as per the problem's constraints, the assistant can't assume values, so this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant is supposed to use the current time as a given, and proceed to calculate the timestamps.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n- To find reminders set for yesterday, we need the reminder_timestamp to be within yesterday's date.\n\n- Yesterday's start: 00:00:00 of the day before today.\n\n- Yesterday's end: 23:59:59 of the", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "NO_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
