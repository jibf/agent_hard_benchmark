Let me check the tools provided.\n\nFirst, I need to see if there's a function that can send a message. Looking at the tools, there's send_message_with_phone_number. It requires a phone number and content. But the user didn't provide a phone number. The problem says not to make assumptions about values, so I can't just guess Fredrik's number. \n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to know the phone number? But the instructions say not to assume values. So I should ask for clarification. The user didn't specify the phone number, so I can't proceed without it. I need to request the phone number to use the send_message function.\n</think>\n\nTo send a message to Fredrik Thordendal, I'll need his phone number.

So I can't use send_message_with_phone_number without the number. The other tools are for checking service statuses like cellular, location, wifi. Maybe they're trying to see if the phone is connected to send a message, but the main issue is the missing phone number.\n\nWait, the user already said they don't have the phone number. So there's no way to send the message without it. The assistant needs to inform them that without the phone number, the message can't be sent. Maybe check if there's another way, but the tools provided only allow sending via phone number. So the correct response is to state that the phone number is required and since it's not provided, the action can't be completed.\n</think>\n\nSince I don't have access to Fredrik Thordendal's phone number and you've confirmed you don't have it either, I cannot send the message.
