The user wants to postpone their most recent reminder to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the most recent reminder is. To do that, I should search for reminders. The search_reminder function can help here. Since they want the most recent one, I probably need to look at the creation timestamp. The most recent would have the highest creation timestamp.\n\nBut how do I get the current timestamp? Maybe use get_current_timestamp to know what \"most recent\" means. Wait, but the search_reminder can take creation_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. If I get the current timestamp, then set the upperbound to that, and maybe lowerbound to a day ago or something? But the user says \"most recent\", so maybe just find the one with the latest creation time.\n\nWait, the search_reminder function's parameters include creation_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. If I want the most recent, I need to find the reminder with the highest creation_timestamp. But how to do that with the search function? Maybe search without any bounds and then sort the results? But the function description says it returns all entries matching the criteria. Hmm, maybe I need to get all reminders and then pick the one with the latest creation timestamp.\n\nWait, but the user says \"most recent reminder\", so perhaps the one with the latest creation timestamp. So first, I need to search all reminders, then find the one with the max creation_timestamp.\n\nBut to search all reminders, I can call search_reminder with no parameters, since none are required. Then, from the results, pick the one with the highest creation_timestamp.\n\nOnce I have that reminder's ID, I need to modify it to set the reminder_timestamp to tomorrow at 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call search_reminder with no parameters to get all reminders.\n2. Identify the most recent one (highest creation_timestamp).\n3. Calculate tomorrow's 5 PM as a POSIX timestamp.\n   a. Get current timestamp (get_current_timestamp).\n   b. Shift it by 1 day and set time to 17:00 (5 PM).\n   Wait, but shifting by 1 day might not account for the time. Alternatively, get current timestamp, convert to datetime info, set day+1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nWait, maybe better to use get_current_timestamp, then shift it by 1 day, but set the time to 5 PM. Wait, but shifting by 1 day from current time might not land exactly at 5 PM tomorrow. For example, if current time is 3 PM today, adding 1 day would be 3 PM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM.\n\nSo need to set the time to 5 PM tomorrow.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Get current timestamp (now).\n- Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.).\n- Increment day by 1, set hour to 17, minutes and seconds to 0.\n- Convert that back to timestamp.\n\nSo steps for timestamp:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current date/time components.\n3. Modify the components: day +1, hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n4. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp to convert back to POSIX.\n\nWait, but what if tomorrow is the next month or year? The functions should handle that.\n\nSo first, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info.\n\nAdd 1 to day, but if day exceeds the month's days, it should roll over. However, the timestamp_to_datetime_info and datetime_info_to_timestamp functions should handle that correctly.\n\nWait, but when we get the current datetime info, add 1 to day, then convert back, it should automatically handle month/year transitions.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_time = get_current_timestamp()\n\ncurrent_info = timestamp_to_datetime_info(current_time)\n\ntomorrow_info = {\n  year: current_info.year,\n  month: current_info.month,\n  day: current_info.day + 1,\n  hour: 17,\n  minute: 0,\n  second: 0\n}\n\nBut need to check if adding 1 to day is valid. However, the datetime_info_to_timestamp function should handle invalid dates by adjusting, but maybe better to use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, another approach: shift the current timestamp by 1 day, then adjust the time to 17:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by 1 day would add 24 hours, which might not be exactly tomorrow at 5 PM if current time is after 5 PM. Wait, no. For example, if current time is 6 PM today, adding 1 day would be 6 PM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM tomorrow. So shifting by 1 day isn't sufficient.\n\nSo better to set the date to tomorrow (current date +1 day) at 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info.\n3. Increment day by 1.\n4. Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n5. Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut need to handle cases where incrementing day goes to next month, etc. But the conversion functions should take care of that.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that.\n\nThen, create new datetime info with day+1, hour=17, etc.\n\nThen, use datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nAlternatively, use shift_timestamp to add 1 day, but then set the time components. Wait, shift_timestamp can shift by days, but if you shift by 1 day, it's 24 hours, so if current time is 3 PM, shifting by 1 day is 3 PM next day. But user wants 5 PM, so need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncurrent_time = get_current_timestamp()\n\nshifted_time = shift_timestamp(current_time, days=1)\n\nBut then, shifted_time is 24 hours from now. To get to 5 PM tomorrow, regardless of current time, perhaps better to calculate the exact timestamp for tomorrow 5 PM.\n\nYes, so:\n\ntoday's date components +1 day, time 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Convert to datetime info.\n\n- Add 1 to day.\n\n- Set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\n- Convert back to timestamp.\n\nBut what if adding 1 day causes the month to roll over? For example, current date is Jan 31, adding 1 day would be Feb 1. The conversion functions should handle that.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, timestamp_to_datetime_info on that.\n\nThen, modify the day, hour, etc.\n\nThen, datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nSo, let's outline the tool calls needed.\n\nFirst, get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n\nThen, timestamp_to_datetime_info on that result.\n\nThen, modify the datetime info (day+1, hour=17, etc.)\n\nThen, datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the new reminder timestamp.\n\nBut also, need to find the most recent reminder.\n\nSo first, search_reminder to get all reminders, then find the one with the latest creation_timestamp.\n\nWait, but how to get the most recent reminder? The search_reminder function can return all reminders if no parameters are given. Then, among those, pick the one with the highest creation_timestamp.\n\nBut the user says \"most recent\", which likely refers to the reminder that was created most recently, i.e., highest creation_timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call search_reminder with no parameters to get all reminders.\n\n2. From the results, find the reminder with the maximum creation_timestamp.\n\n3. Take that reminder's ID.\n\n4. Calculate tomorrow 5 PM timestamp as described.\n\n5. Call modify_reminder with the reminder_id, new reminder_timestamp.\n\nBut the user might have multiple reminders, so need to ensure we pick the correct one.\n\nSo first tool call: search_reminder with no args.\n\nThen, process the results to find the most recent.\n\nBut as an assistant, I can't process the results; I need to generate tool calls. Wait, the assistant's job is to generate the correct tool calls step by step.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to \"Postpone my most recent reminder to tomorrow 5PM.\"\n\nSo the assistant needs to figure out which functions to call in sequence.\n\nFirst, to find the most recent reminder, call search_reminder with no parameters. But the search_reminder function's description says it returns all entries matching the criteria. Since no criteria are given, it should return all reminders.\n\nThen, from those results, the most recent is the one with the highest creation_timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant can't process the data; it has to generate tool calls. Wait, no—the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls needed, and the system will handle the responses. Wait, but in this context, the assistant is supposed to output the tool calls step by step.\n\nWait, the problem is that the assistant needs to generate the correct sequence of tool calls to achieve the user's request.\n\nSo first, call search_reminder to get all reminders.\n\nThen, based on the response (which the assistant doesn't have yet), determine the most recent one.\n\nBut since the assistant can't see the response, it has to assume that the search will return the necessary data.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, for each turn, the assistant should output the next tool call(s). So in this case, the first step is to search for the reminders.\n\nSo first tool call: search_reminder with no parameters.\n\nThen, once the results are obtained (in the next step), the assistant would", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
