The user wants to add a reminder to buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current date isn't provided, I should probably get the current timestamp first to calculate tomorrow's date. Wait, there's a function called get_current_timestamp that can give me the current POSIX timestamp. But maybe I can also use datetime_info_to_timestamp if I know the date components. However, since the user says \"tomorrow,\" I need to know today's date to compute tomorrow's.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify the current date, so I need to get the current timestamp to determine what \"tomorrow\" is. Let me check the tools available. There's get_current_timestamp which requires no parameters. So first, I should call that to get the current time.\n\nOnce I have the current timestamp, I can convert it to datetime info (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info. Then, add one day to the day component, making sure to handle month and year changes if necessary. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, if I get the current timestamp, add 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get tomorrow's timestamp at the same time. But the user wants 5 PM tomorrow. Wait, 5 PM is 17:00 in 24-hour format.\n\nWait, but if I get the current timestamp, and then calculate tomorrow at 5 PM, I need to set the time to 17:00 on the next day. So perhaps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get today's date and time.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (add 1 day).\n4. Set the time to 17:00:00.\n5. Convert that datetime to a POSIX timestamp.\n\nBut the tools provided include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. So maybe the steps are:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get current date and time.\n- Then, increment the day by 1, but check if it's the end of the month, etc. However, since the user just says \"tomorrow,\" maybe it's safe to assume adding 1 day, but the function might handle that. Wait, but the assistant can't do date calculations, so it needs to use the tools.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can calculate the timestamp by taking current timestamp, adding 24*3600 seconds, but set the time to 17:00. Wait, but if the current time is, say, 3 PM today, adding 24 hours would be 3 PM tomorrow, but the user wants 5 PM. So that approach wouldn't work.\n\nSo better approach:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).\n3. Create a new datetime for tomorrow at 17:00:00.\n   - Tomorrow's day = current day +1, but handle month/year rollover.\n4. Convert that new datetime to timestamp using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't compute the date, it needs to use the tools. Wait, the assistant can structure the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp once it knows the date components.\n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that timestamp to get the current year, month, day, etc.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date: if current day is 30 and month is April (30 days), then next day is 1st of May. But the assistant can't do that logic, so perhaps it's better to add 24 hours to the current timestamp and then adjust the time to 17:00. Wait, but adding 24 hours would give the same time tomorrow. So if current time is 10 AM, adding 24 hours is 10 AM tomorrow, but user wants 5 PM. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: take the current timestamp, convert to datetime, set the time to 17:00:00 of the next day.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Get current datetime info.\n- Tomorrow's date is current date +1 day.\n- Set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n- Convert that to timestamp.\n\nBut how to compute tomorrow's date? For example, if today is March 31, tomorrow is April 1.\n\nBut the assistant can't compute that, so it needs to rely on the tools. Wait, no, the assistant has to generate the parameters for datetime_info_to_timestamp. So the assistant would have to calculate the correct year, month, day.\n\nBut since the assistant is an AI, it can perform date arithmetic. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. However, in this case, the user says \"tomorrow,\" so the assistant needs to calculate tomorrow's date based on current date.\n\nWait, but the assistant doesn't have access to the current date unless it calls get_current_timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current POSIX timestamp.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (current day +1), adjusting month and year if necessary.\n4. Set the time to 17:00:00.\n5. Use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date and time to get the reminder timestamp.\n\nBut the assistant has to do this step-by-step, making multiple tool calls.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to add a reminder for tomorrow 5 PM. So the assistant needs to generate the correct timestamp for that.\n\nFirst, get current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert to datetime info.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do that internally, it needs to use the tools. Wait, no, the assistant can perform the date calculation as part of its reasoning, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the computed values.\n\nWait, but the assistant is supposed to call the tools as needed. Let's see.\n\nThe user says \"tomorrow 5PM\". So the assistant needs to figure out the exact timestamp.\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to know the current time.\n\nSuppose the current timestamp is T.\n\nThen, convert T to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date: day +=1. If day exceeds days in month, increment month, etc.\n\nBut the assistant can do that calculation. For example, if today is 2023-10-31, tomorrow is 2023-11-01.\n\nOnce the correct date is calculated, set hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThen, call datetime_info_to_timestamp with those values.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with the result from step 1.\n3. Calculate the new date (tomorrow) and set time to 17:00:00.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date and time.\n\nBut the assistant has to make these tool calls in sequence.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to determine which tool calls are needed for the user's request. The user's request is to add a reminder, which requires a timestamp. Since the timestamp isn't provided, the assistant needs to compute it using the available tools.\n\nSo first, get the current timestamp.\n\nThen, convert it to datetime info to know today's date.\n\nThen, compute tomorrow's date and 5 PM.\n\nBut the assistant can't compute the date internally; it has to use the tools. Wait, noâ€”the assistant can perform the date calculation as part of its reasoning, then use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the calculated values.\n\nWait, but the assistant doesn't have the capability to calculate dates; it has to rely on the tools. Hmm, no, the assistant is an AI that can reason, so it can calculate that tomorrow is today's date plus one day, adjusting for month/year as needed.\n\nBut to get today's date, it needs to call get_current_timestamp and then timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time.\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on that to get current date and time.\n3. Calculate tomorrow's date (current day +1, handle month/year changes).\n4. Set time to 17:00:00.\n5. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the new date and time to get the reminder timestamp.\n6. Then, call add_reminder with the content, the computed timestamp, and the location (Whole Foods).\n\nBut the user mentioned \"at Whole Foods\", which is a location. So we need to get the latitude and longitude for Whole Foods. However, the user didn't specify which Whole Foods location. This is ambiguous. The user might be referring to the nearest one, but the function search_location_around_lat_lon requires a location string and optionally latitude and longitude. But since we don't have the current location, perhaps we need to first get the current location? Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get current location. The search_lat_lon function takes latitude and longitude to search, but we don't have those.\n\nWait, the user says \"at Whole Foods\", so maybe we need to search for Whole Foods locations. The function search_location_around_lat_lon can be used with location=\"Whole Foods\", but it requires latitude and longitude.
