The user asked how much 2048 USD is in CNY. I used the convert_currency function with amount 2048, from_currency_code USD, and to_currency_code CNY. The response from the tool was 14705.15376128.\n\nNow I need to present this answer clearly. The user probably wants a straightforward conversion result. Since currency conversions often use two decimal places, I should round it to 14705.15 CNY. But wait, sometimes they might expect more precision, but typically for money, two decimals are standard. Let me check if there's any specific instruction about decimal places, but the user didn't mention it. So rounding to two decimal places makes sense here.\n\nAlso, I should mention the exchange rate used, but the tool response doesn't provide the rate, just the converted amount. Maybe I should state the result as approximately 14,705.15 CNY. Including a comma for thousands makes it easier to read. Let me format it properly. So the final answer would be 2048 USD is equal to approximately 14,705.15 CNY. Double-check the numbers: 2048 multiplied by the exchange rate gives that value. Since the exact number was 14705.15376128, rounding to two decimals is correct. Yeah, that should be it.\n</think>\n\n2048 USD is equivalent to **14,705.15 CNY** (rounded to two decimal places based on the conversion result provided). \n\n*Note: Exchange rates fluctuate, so this value reflects the rate at the time of conversion.*", "turn_idx": 2}], "eval_result": {"score": 1.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "SINGLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "NO_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 1.0, "turn_count": 3, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [17, 1.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
