The user is asking, \"What's the reminder I created yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a function that can search for reminders. Looking at the tools provided, there's a function called search_reminder. Let me check its parameters.\n\nThe search_reminder function allows searching based on various criteria, including creation timestamp lower and upper bounds. Since the user mentioned \"yesterday,\" I need to calculate the timestamp range for yesterday.\n\nWait, but to get the current timestamp, I should use get_current_timestamp. Then, subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday. But how exactly?\n\nWait, the user says \"created yesterday,\" so the creation timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the end of yesterday. So I need to find the POSIX timestamps for 00:00:00 yesterday and 23:59:59 yesterday.\n\nBut to compute that, I need the current timestamp first. So first call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get the start of yesterday. Wait, but depending on the current time, yesterday's start would be current time minus 24 hours, but adjusted to midnight.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system can handle the date calculation. But according to the tools, there's a function called shift_timestamp which can shift a timestamp by days, hours, etc. But to use that, I need a base timestamp. So first, get the current timestamp.\n\nSo step 1: call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n\nThen, calculate yesterday's start and end. For example, if current timestamp is T, then yesterday's start would be T minus 24 hours, but adjusted to 00:00:00 of the previous day. Wait, but maybe the user just means any time in the last 24 hours? But \"yesterday\" usually refers to the previous calendar day, not the last 24 hours.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The user might mean the previous calendar day. So for example, if today is October 5th, yesterday is October 4th, from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.\n\nTo get those timestamps, I need to:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert it to datetime info to find the start of today (midnight).\n3. Subtract one day to get start of yesterday.\n4. Then the upper bound would be start of today.\n\nWait, but the tools have timestamp_to_datetime_info and datetime_info_to_timestamp functions. So perhaps:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n- Convert to datetime info to get year, month, day, etc.\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0 for today's start.\n- Subtract one day to get yesterday's start.\n- Then, yesterday's end would be today's start minus 1 second.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps. However, the user is asking for reminders created yesterday, so the creation_timestamp should be between start of yesterday and end of yesterday.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations itself, it needs to use the available functions. Wait, the assistant can call functions step by step.\n\nWait, the problem is that to compute the correct timestamps for yesterday, the assistant needs to use the get_current_timestamp, then possibly shift it.\n\nWait, there's a function called shift_timestamp that can shift a timestamp by days. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by -1 day to get T-1d.\n- But that gives the same time yesterday. However, the user wants the entire day of yesterday, so from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can calculate the lower and upper bounds by:\n\nLower bound: current timestamp minus 24 hours (but this would be the last 24 hours, which might not align with calendar day).\n\nBut the user said \"yesterday,\" which is a calendar day, not the last 24 hours. So this requires more precise calculation.\n\nGiven the tools available, maybe the best approach is:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get current time (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime_info to get today's date.\n3. Set time to 00:00:00 for today, which gives start of today (T_start_today).\n4. Subtract 1 day to get start of yesterday (T_start_yesterday).\n5. Start of today minus 1 second is end of yesterday (T_end_yesterday).\n\nBut to do steps 3-5, the assistant would need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp and shift_timestamp.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on T to get year, month, day, etc.\n- Then, create a new datetime_info with day = day -1, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n- Convert that to timestamp for start of yesterday.\n- Similarly, start of today would be (year, month, day, 0,0,0), so start of yesterday is (year, month, day-1, 0,0,0).\n- Then, end of yesterday is start of today minus 1 second.\n\nBut the assistant can't do this calculation on its own; it has to call the functions. So the process would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T to get current date/time.\n3. Modify the datetime_info to set hour, minute, second to 0 (start of today).\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the modified info to get T_start_today.\n5. Call shift_timestamp with T_start_today, days=-1 to get T_start_yesterday.\n6. Then, T_end_yesterday = T_start_today - 1.\n\nBut each of these steps requires a function call, and the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. Wait, the user's question is a single query, so the assistant needs to figure out the correct parameters for search_reminder.\n\nBut given the constraints, maybe the assistant should first get the current timestamp, then calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's creation timestamps.\n\nHowever, since the assistant can't perform calculations, it has to rely on the tools. Wait, but the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp to get the current time. Then, based on that, compute the lower and upper bounds for yesterday.\n\nBut since the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, and the user's question is a single query, the assistant needs to determine the correct parameters for search_reminder.\n\nWait, but the assistant can generate multiple tool calls in sequence. However, in this scenario, the user is asking a single question, so the assistant needs to figure out the necessary steps.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.\"\n\nSo the assistant should make the necessary function calls to answer the user's question.\n\nIn this case, to find reminders created yesterday, the assistant needs to:\n\n1. Determine the timestamp range for yesterday.\n2. Use search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound set to the start and end of yesterday.\n\nTo get the timestamp range, the assistant needs to calculate it, which requires:\n\n- Getting the current timestamp.\n- Calculating yesterday's start and end.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, based on that timestamp, compute the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut since the assistant can't compute it itself, it has to use the available functions. Wait, there's a function called shift_timestamp which can shift the current timestamp by days.\n\nWait, let's say current timestamp is T. To get the start of yesterday:\n\n- Shift T by -1 day, but also adjust to midnight.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp (T).\n- Convert T to datetime_info.\n- Set hour, minute, second to 0 (start of today).\n- Subtract 1 day to get start of yesterday.\n- Start of today minus 1 second is end of yesterday.\n\nBut each of these steps requires function calls.\n\nHowever, given that the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, but the user's question requires multiple steps, the assistant should first call get_current_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the problem states that for each function call, the assistant should return a tool_call. So in this case, the first step is to get the current timestamp.\n\nSo the first tool call would be get_current_timestamp.\n\nThen, based on the response, the next step would be to calculate the lower and upper bounds, but since the assistant can't do that, it would need to make further tool calls.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, the assistant is supposed to generate the necessary tool calls to answer the user's question. However, the user is asking for the reminder created yesterday, so the assistant needs to search for reminders with creation timestamp between start and end of yesterday.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call search_reminder with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound set to the start and end of yesterday.\n\nBut to get those values, the assistant needs to calculate them, which requires knowing the current time.\n\nSo first, call get_current_timestamp.\n\nWait, but the assistant can't know the current timestamp without calling the function. So the first step is to call get_current_timestamp.\n\nTherefore, the first tool call is get_current_timestamp.\n\nOnce we have the current timestamp, we can compute the lower and upper", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
