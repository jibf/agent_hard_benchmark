Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I called get_current_timestamp to get the current time, which was 1755253474.968548. Then, I used search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to that timestamp to find all reminders from now onwards. But the response was an empty list, meaning there are no upcoming reminders.\n\nHmm, so the user mentioned \"upcoming,\" but there are none. Maybe they thought there was one, but actually, there's nothing to remove. I should check if there's a possibility of a reminder that's very close in time, but since the search uses the current timestamp as the lower bound, anything scheduled now or later should be included. Since the result is empty, there really are no upcoming reminders.\n\nI need to inform the user that there are no upcoming reminders to remove. Maybe they made a mistake or the reminder was already deleted. I should present this clearly and ask if they need anything else.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders found after the current timestamp.

The user is trying to remove an upcoming reminder but isn't sure if they have one. Earlier steps showed that when they searched for reminders after the current timestamp, there were none. Then they tried a general search without criteria, which caused an error. The system tried to set a broad time range but got errors about the timestamp values being out of range.\n\nSo, the problem is that the search_reminder function has constraints on the timestamp parameters. The valid range for reminder_timestamp_upperbound is up to 2524604400.0, which I should check what that corresponds to in real time. Let me convert that timestamp to a date.\n\nUsing the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might help. Wait, but maybe I can calculate it. 2524604400 seconds since Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970). Let me see: 2524604400 divided by 60 is minutes, divided by 60 hours, etc. Alternatively, I know that 2^31 is around 2.1e9, so 2.5e9 is a bit beyond that. Wait, 2524604400 is approximately 2.524e9. Let me check a timestamp converter.\n\nWait, 2524604400 is actually December 31, 2049 at 23:00:00 UTC. Because 2038 is the year when 32-bit timestamps overflow (2^31-1 is 2147483647, which is Jan 19, 2038). So 2524604400 is way beyond that, but the error says the upper bound is 2524604400.0. Wait, the error message said \"valid range maximum of 2524604400.0\". So the system has a maximum allowed timestamp of 2524604400, which is December 31, 2049, 23:00:00 UTC.\n\nWait, but when the user tried to set upperbound to 2524608000, which is 2524608000 - 2524604400 = 3600 seconds more, so 1 hour later. So 2524608000 would be January 1, 2050, 00:00:00. But the system's max is 2524604400, which is Dec 31, 2049 23:00:00.\n\nSo to set the upper bound correctly, the maximum allowed is 2524604400. So the previous attempt used 2524608000 which is over, hence the error.\n\nSo the correct upper bound should be 2524604400. Let me check the exact value. The error says the maximum is 2524604400.0, so the upperbound parameter must be <= that.\n\nSimilarly, the lower bound minimum was 315529200. Let's see what that is. 315529200 seconds. 315529200 / (60*60*24*365) ≈ 10 years. So 1970 + 10 = 1980. Let me compute it: 315529200 seconds is 10 years (31536000 seconds per year) so approximately 1980. But exact date: 315529200 is 1980-01-01 00:00:00? Maybe not exactly, but the point is the system has a minimum lower bound of 315529200.\n\nSo to search all possible reminders, the user needs to set lowerbound to 315529200 and upperbound to 2524604400.\n\nWait, in the previous tool call, the assistant tried {\"reminder_timestamp_lowerbound\": 315529200, \"reminder_timestamp_upperbound\": 2524604400}, but the error said upperbound is larger than maximum 2524604400.0. Wait, but 2524604400 is exactly the maximum. Maybe the error is because it's a float and the value is slightly over? Or maybe the system expects an integer?\n\nWait, the error message says \"Parameter 'reminder_timestamp_upperbound' is larger than its valid range maximum of 2524604400.0.\" So if the value provided is 2524604400, which is equal to the maximum, it should be allowed. But maybe the system is checking strictly greater than, so 2524604400.0 is the max, so the upperbound must be <= 2524604400.0. If the value passed is 2524604400, which is an integer, but the system expects a float, maybe there's a precision issue. For example, 2524604400 as an integer is exactly 2524604400.0 as a float, so it should be acceptable.\n\nWait, but the error message in the previous step was when the upperbound was set to 2524608000, which is higher than 2524604400.0. Then the next attempt set upperbound to 2524604400, but the error says it's larger than the maximum. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the user's previous messages.\n\nWait, the user's last tool response was:\n\nValueError: Parameter 'reminder_timestamp_upperbound' is larger than its valid range maximum of 2524604400.0.\n\nSo when the assistant called search_reminder with upperbound 2524604400, the system said it's larger than the maximum. But 2524604400 is the maximum. So perhaps the maximum is actually 2524604399.999... or the system expects the upperbound to be strictly less than. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the error message, and the actual maximum is 2524604399.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's maximum is 2524604400, but the parameter must be less than that, not less than or equal. So to stay within the limit, set upperbound to 2524604399.\n\nWait, but how to know? The error says the maximum is 2524604400.0, so if you pass 2524604400.0, it's equal, which should be allowed. But the error says it's larger, which suggests that perhaps the maximum is actually 2524604399.999..., so 2524604400.0 is over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system uses integer timestamps, and 2524604400 is the maximum integer value allowed, so passing it as a float (2524604400.0) is acceptable.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the error message, when the assistant tried 2524604400 as upperbound, the system said it's larger than the maximum. Therefore, the maximum must be slightly less than that. So perhaps the correct upperbound is 2524604399.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects the upperbound to be the maximum timestamp possible, which is 2524604400 - 1, so 2524604399.\n\nBut how to determine the exact value? Since the error says the maximum is 2524604400.0, but passing that value causes an error, perhaps the actual maximum is 2524604399.999..., so the safe value is 2524604399.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's maximum is 2524604400, but the parameter is exclusive, so upperbound must be less than that. Therefore, setting upperbound to 2524604400 - 1 = 2524604399.\n\nSo the correct call would be:\n\nreminder_timestamp_lowerbound: 315529200\n\nreminder_timestamp_upperbound: 2524604399\n\nLet me check what 2524604399 is in date.
