Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact timestamp for next Friday at 5 PM. Since the current date isn't specified, I'll assume today's date. But wait, the problem is that without knowing the current date, I can't calculate \"next Friday.\" However, the tools provided include functions that can help with date and time calculations.\n\nLooking at the tools, there's get_current_timestamp which gives the current POSIX timestamp. Then, there's shift_timestamp which can adjust a timestamp by weeks, days, etc. Also, search_holiday might not be relevant here, but datetime_info_to_timestamp could be used if I can figure out the date components.\n\nWait, the user said \"next Friday.\" If today is, say, Tuesday, next Friday is in 3 days. But if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days later. So I need to determine how many days until the next Friday from the current date.\n\nBut how to compute that? Maybe using timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current day of the week, then calculate the difference. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Get the current timestamp using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that timestamp to datetime info (year, month, day, isoweekday) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Determine how many days to add to reach the next Friday. Friday is isoweekday 5. If current day is 5 (Friday), then add 7 days. If current day is 6 (Saturday), add 6 days, etc.\n4. Use shift_timestamp to add the calculated days to the current timestamp to get the reminder timestamp.\n5. Then call add_reminder with the content \"next Friday 5PM\" and the calculated timestamp.\n\nBut wait, the user specified 5 PM. So after finding the date of next Friday, set the time to 17:00 (5 PM in 24-hour format).\n\nWait, but the shift_timestamp function can adjust hours as well. So once we have the date part correct, we need to set the time to 17:00.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the current timestamp, calculate the next Friday's date, then set the time to 17:00.\n\nHmm, but how to set the exact time. Let's think:\n\nSuppose current timestamp is T. Convert T to datetime info. Let's say today is Wednesday (isoweekday 3). Next Friday is 2 days later. So add 2 days. Then, set the hour to 17, minutes to 0, seconds to 0.\n\nBut how to adjust the time part. Maybe after shifting to the correct date, adjust the time.\n\nWait, the shift_timestamp function allows adding hours, minutes, etc. So steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info to find current day of week (isoweekday).\n3. Calculate days_until_next_friday = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If current day is Friday (5), then (5-5+7)%7=7%7=0, but we want next Friday, so add 7 days. Wait, maybe days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday) % 7. If current day is Friday, that gives 0, but we need 7 days. So days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If result is 0, then it's 7 days. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf today is Monday (1), days until Friday (5) is 4 days. (5-1)=4.\n\nIf today is Friday (5), (5-5)=0, but next Friday is 7 days later, so days_until = 7.\n\nSo formula: days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If 0, then 7.\n\nWait, (5 - current_isoweekday) mod 7. If current_isoweekday is 5, (5-5)=0 mod7=0. So days_until = 7 if 0.\n\nSo days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If the result is 0, set to 7.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute as (5 - current_isoweekday) % 7. If negative, add 7.\n\nAlternatively, days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If days_until is 0, then it's today, but we want next Friday, so add 7.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If days_until is 0, then it's 7 days.\n\nWait, let's take examples:\n\nCurrent day | isoweekday | days until next Friday\nMonday       | 1          | 4 (5-1=4)\nTuesday      | 2          | 3\nWednesday    | 3          | 2\nThursday     | 4          | 1\nFriday       | 5          | 7 (since next Friday is a week later)\nSaturday     | 6          | 6 (5-6= -1 +7=6)\nSunday       | 7          | 5 (5-7= -2 +7=5)\n\nYes, that formula works. So days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If the result is 0, it would be 7, but in reality, when current_isoweekday is 5, (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0, so days_until=0, but we need 7 days. So perhaps days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday) % 7. If negative, add 7. Then if days_until is 0, set to 7.\n\nWait, for Friday (5): (5-5)=0, which is 0, so days_until=7.\n\nFor Saturday (6): (5-6)= -1, mod7 is 6 (since -1 +7=6).\n\nSo days_until = (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7. If the result is 0, then 7, else the result.\n\nBut perhaps the formula (5 - current_isoweekday + 7) % 7 gives the correct days. For Friday, it's 7%7=0, but we need 7 days. So if the result is 0, set days to 7.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n3. Compute days = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7.\n4. If days == 0, days =7.\n5. Then, shift current timestamp by days days, and set time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but the current time might be after 5 PM on Friday. For example, if today is Friday at 6 PM, then \"next Friday\" would be 7 days later. So the calculation above still holds because days_until would be 7.\n\nBut how to adjust the time to 5 PM. So after shifting by days, we need to set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function can shift by days, hours, etc. So after calculating the days until next Friday, we can shift by that many days, then adjust the hours to 17.\n\nWait, but the current timestamp has a time component. For example, if current time is Wednesday 10 AM, and we need next Friday 5 PM, which is 2 days and 7 hours later.\n\nWait, maybe better to:\n\n- Calculate the date of next Friday (midnight), then add 17 hours.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday).\n3. Calculate days_until = (5 - isoweekday +7) %7. If 0, set to 7.\n4. New day = current day + days_until.\n5. But need to handle month/year rollover. However, since we're using POSIX timestamps, perhaps it's easier to shift the timestamp by days_until days, then set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but shifting by days_until days would take us to the correct date, but the time would be the same as current time. So if current time is 10 AM, shifting by days_until days would land us at next Friday 10 AM. Then we need to add 7 hours to get to 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Shift current timestamp by days_until days.\n- Then shift by (17 - current hour) hours. But if current hour is after 17, then we need to add (24 - (current hour -17)) hours? Wait, no. Wait, if we've already shifted to the correct date (next Friday), then regardless of current time, we want 5 PM on that date.\n\nWait, perhaps better to:\n\nAfter shifting by days_until days, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nBut how to do that with the available tools.\n\nThe shift_timestamp function allows adding days, hours, etc. So:\n\nSuppose current timestamp is T.\n\nCompute days_until as above.\n\nShift T by days_until days: T1 = T + days_until", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "MULTIPLE_USER_TURN", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
