The user is asking for the location of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nFirst, I called the rapid_api_search_tools_2 function with the location set to \"Golden Gate Bridge\". The response came back with details including the full address, latitude, and longitude.\n\nThe response shows the full address as \"Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA\". The latitude is 37.819910899999996 and longitude is -122.4785598. \n\nI need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants to know the city and state, which is San Francisco, California. Including the exact coordinates might be helpful for someone using GPS, but the main answer should be the address. Also, mentioning it's a famous landmark in San Francisco would add context.\n\nI should check if there's any other relevant info from the tool response. The website and description mention it's an iconic art deco bridge opened in 1937, but the user specifically asked for location, so maybe just stick to the address and coordinates. However, adding a brief note about its significance could be useful but not necessary. The main answer should be the location.\n\nSo the answer would state that the Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, CA, with the specific address and coordinates. Maybe format it as: The Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California. Its exact address is Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA. The coordinates are approximately latitude 37.82 and longitude -122.48.\n\nWait, the tool response has the full_address_array as ['Golden Gate Brg', 'San Francisco, CA'], but the full_address is a string. Maybe better to use the full_address from the response. Also, rounding the coordinates to a reasonable decimal place for readability. The latitude is 37.8199 which is about 37.82, longitude -122.4786 which is -122.48.\n\nDouble-checking the tool response: yes, the full_address is \"Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA\". So the answer should include that address and the coordinates. Also, maybe note that it's a major landmark in San Francisco. Keep it concise since the user just asked where it is.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California. Its exact address is **Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Brg, San Francisco, CA**, with coordinates approximately **latitude 37.82° N, longitude 122.48° W**.

The user asked how far the Golden Gate Bridge is from their current location. First, I needed to get their current coordinates. So I called the setting_1 function, which returned their latitude and longitude as 37.334606 and -122.009102.\n\nThen, I had to calculate the distance between their location and the bridge's coordinates. The bridge's coordinates were previously found as latitude 37.819910899999996 and longitude -122.4785598. \n\nI used the utilities_0 function to compute the distance. The response was 67.97730305840021. But wait, what's the unit here? The function's description says it calculates the distance between two lat/lon pairs, but it doesn't specify the unit. Typically, such calculations might return kilometers or miles. \n\nIn the US, people usually use miles for distance. Let me check if the function defaults to miles or kilometers. Since the user is in the US (San Francisco area), and the example parameters don't specify, but the result is around 68. Maybe it's kilometers? Wait, 68 kilometers is about 42 miles. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the Haversine formula, which is commonly used for this, gives distance in kilometers if using Earth's radius in kilometers. But sometimes it's converted to miles. Let me check the actual distance between those points. \n\nThe user's coordinates are 37.3346, -122.0091 (which is around San Jose, CA), and the bridge is at 37.8199, -122.4786 (San Francisco). The straight-line distance between San Jose and San Francisco is roughly 45-50 miles. Wait, 67.97... if it's kilometers, that's about 42 miles, which makes sense. Because 1 km ≈ 0.621371 miles. So 67.97 km * 0.621371 ≈ 42.25 miles.\n\nBut the function's response was 67.97... so the unit is probably kilometers. But the user might expect miles. Wait, the function's description doesn't specify. Hmm. The user is in the US, so they'd likely want miles. Maybe the function returns kilometers, so I need to convert it.\n\nWait, let me check the exact calculation. Let's compute the distance between (37.3346, -122.0091) and (37.8199, -122.4786). Using the Haversine formula:\n\nFirst, convert latitudes and longitudes from degrees to radians.\n\nLatitude difference: 37.8199 - 37.3346 = 0.4853 degrees\nLongitude difference: -122.4786 - (-122.0091) = -0.4695 degrees\n\nConvert to radians:\n0.4853 * π/180 ≈ 0.00847 radians\n0.4695 * π/180 ≈ 0.00819 radians\n\nEarth radius is approximately 6371 km.\n\nHaversine formula:\na = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 ⋅ cos φ2 ⋅ sin²(Δλ/2)\nc = 2 ⋅ atan2(√a, √(1−a))\nd = R ⋅ c\n\nCalculating:\n\nφ1 = 37.3346° = 0.6517 radians\nφ2 = 37.8199° = 0.6601 radians\nΔφ = 0.4853° = 0.00847 radians\nΔλ = -0.4695° = -0.00819 radians\n\na = sin²(0.00847/2) + cos(0.6517) * cos(0.6601) * sin²(0.00819/2)\na ≈ (0.004235)^2 + (0.796) * (0.792) * (0.004095)^2\n≈ 0.0000179 + 0.630 * 0.00001677\n≈ 0.0000179 + 0.00001057 ≈ 0.00002847\n\nc = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a)) ≈ 2 * sqrt(a) ≈ 2 * 0.005336 ≈ 0.01067\n\nd = 6371 * 0.01067 ≈ 68.0 km\n\nSo yes, the distance is approximately 68 kilometers, which is about 42.25 miles.\n\nThe function returned 67.977, which matches the calculation. So the unit is kilometers. But the user is in the US and would expect miles. Therefore, I should convert it to miles and present both or just miles.\n\nThe user said \"how far it is from where I am now\", so I should provide the distance in miles since that's standard in the US. So 67.98 km ≈ 42.25 miles. Rounding to a reasonable decimal place, maybe 42.3 miles.\n\nWait, the tool response was 67.97730305840021. So converting that to miles: 67.9773 * 0.621371 ≈ 42.25 miles.\n\nSo the answer should state the distance is approximately 42.3 miles (or 68 kilometers) from the user's current location.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately **42.3 miles (68 kilometers)** away from your current location in San Jose, California.
