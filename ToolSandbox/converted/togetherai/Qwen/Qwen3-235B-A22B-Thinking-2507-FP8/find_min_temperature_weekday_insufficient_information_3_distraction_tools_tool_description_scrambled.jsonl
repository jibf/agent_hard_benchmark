Let me see what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what date \"this Friday\" refers to. But wait, the user didn't specify a location. Temperature can vary a lot depending on where you are. The tools provided include a function called search_lat_lon which requires latitude and longitude. So, without knowing the location, I can't proceed. \n\nAlso, to get the temperature for a specific day, I probably need the date in a timestamp format. There's a function datetime_info_to_timestamp that converts date and time to a timestamp. But again, without knowing the exact date (year, month, day, etc.), I can't use that. However, the user mentioned \"this Friday,\" which is relative to the current date. But since I don't have access to the current date, maybe the user expects me to assume today's date? Wait, but the assistant doesn't have real-time data. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the tools given don't include a weather API function. The available functions are search_lat_lon, datetime_info_to_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info. The search_lat_lon function's description is empty, but maybe it's supposed to get location data? But even if I get latitude and longitude, there's no function to retrieve temperature data. The user is asking for temperature, but none of the provided tools can fetch weather information. \n\nSo, the problem here is that the user is asking for something (temperature) that the available tools can't provide. The tools are for converting between datetime and timestamps and searching by lat/lon, but not for weather data. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't answer their question because the necessary tools aren't available. But wait, maybe the search_lat_lon is a placeholder for a weather function? The description is empty, so it's unclear. However, based on the given tool definitions, there's no function that can retrieve temperature data. \n\nAdditionally, the user didn't provide a location, so even if there was a weather function, I'd need the latitude and longitude. But since the tools don't include a weather API, I can't proceed. Therefore, the correct response is to point out that the required information (location) is missing and that the available tools don't support temperature queries.\n</think>\n\nThe user is asking for the lowest temperature this Friday, but there are two critical issues:\n\n1. **Location is unspecified**: Temperature depends on geographic location, but no latitude/longitude or place name was provided.\n2. **No weather data tools available**: The provided functions only handle datetime conversions and lat/lon searches - none can retrieve weather/temperature data.\n\nI cannot answer this query because:\n- The required location parameters are missing\n- The available tools don't support weather information retrieval\n\n<response>\nI don't have access to weather data or the ability to check temperatures. Additionally, you didn't specify a location for this temperature request. Could you please clarify both the location and confirm if you'd like help with something that can be addressed using the available tools?\n</response>", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
