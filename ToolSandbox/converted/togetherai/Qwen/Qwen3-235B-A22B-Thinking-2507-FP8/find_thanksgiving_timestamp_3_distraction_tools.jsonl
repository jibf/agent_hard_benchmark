I called the search_holiday function with \"Thanksgiving\" as the holiday name. The response was 1764219600.0.\n\nFirst, I need to check if that timestamp makes sense. Let me convert it to a human-readable date to verify. Using an epoch converter, 1764219600 corresponds to November 28, 2024, at 12:00:00 AM UTC. Wait, but Thanksgiving in the US is the fourth Thursday of November. Let me confirm the date for 2024. \n\nIn 2024, November 1st is a Friday. So the first Thursday would be November 7th. Then the fourth Thursday would be November 28th. That matches the timestamp. So the function returned the correct date.\n\nThe user asked for the timestamp, so the answer is 1764219600. But maybe they want it in a specific format. The problem says the function canonicalizes to POSIX timestamp, which is seconds since epoch. The response is a float, but POSIX timestamps are usually integers. However, the function returned 1764219600.0, which is an integer as a float. So the answer is 1764219600.\n\nI should present this as the timestamp. Maybe mention the date it corresponds to for clarity, but the user specifically asked for the timestamp, so the main answer is the number.\n</think>\n\nThe POSIX timestamp for Thanksgiving (as of the current year) is **1764219600**, which corresponds to **November 28, 2024 at 00:00:00 UTC**. \n\nThis reflects the fourth Thursday of November (the official U.S. Thanksgiving date) for the year 2024.", "turn_idx": 2}], "eval_result": {"score": 1.0, "categories": ["SINGLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 1.0, "turn_count": 3, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [17, 1.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
