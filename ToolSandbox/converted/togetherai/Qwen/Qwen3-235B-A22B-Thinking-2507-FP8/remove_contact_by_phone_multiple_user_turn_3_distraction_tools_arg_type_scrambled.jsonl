Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's a remove_contact function. It requires the person_id as a parameter. The user didn't specify which contact they want to delete, so I need more information. \n\nThe problem is they just said \"delete someone\" without giving a name, number, or ID. The remove_contact function needs the person_id, which is a unique identifier. Without that, I can't proceed. \n\nI should ask the user for the specific contact's person_id or maybe help them find it first. Maybe they don't know the ID, so perhaps I should suggest using search_contacts to find the contact by name or phone number first. But the user's request is to delete, so I need to clarify what exactly they need.\n\nWait, the instructions say not to make assumptions. So I can't assume they have the person_id. I need to prompt them to provide the person_id or more details to identify the contact. Let me check if there's another way. The remove_contact only takes person_id, so without that, I can't call the function. \n\nTherefore, I should respond by asking for the person_id of the contact they want to delete. Alternatively, if they don't know it, maybe guide them to search first.

They mentioned they don't have that information. So, first, I need to figure out how to proceed without the person_id.\n\nLooking at the tools available, there's the search_contacts function. It allows searching by name, phone number, relationship, etc. Since the user doesn't have the person_id, they probably know some other details like the name or phone number.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any specific details yet. My previous response asked for either the person_id or name/phone number. Now they're saying they don't have the info. Wait, maybe they don't have the person_id but might know other details. However, in their latest message, they just said \"I don't have that information.\" So they might not have the person_id or any other details. But that's unlikely. Maybe they need to search first.\n\nWait, the user's initial request was to delete someone, but they don't have the person_id. So the correct step is to first search for the contact using available info. But since they don't have the person_id, they need to provide name or phone number to search.\n\nBut in the current message, the user says \"I don't have that information.\" Which information? Probably the person_id. So they need to search using other criteria.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any other details yet. So I need to prompt them again to provide name or phone number to perform the search.\n\nWait, the previous message from the assistant asked for person_id or name/phone. The user replied they don't have that info. Wait, maybe they don't have the person_id, but they do have the name or phone. But they might be confused. So the assistant needs to clarify again.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"I don't have that information.\" So they might not have the person_id, but perhaps they have other info. The assistant should ask again for name or phone number to search.\n\nSo the next step is to ask the user to provide the name or phone number of the contact they want to delete. Because without any identifying info, we can't search or delete.\n\nTherefore, the response should be to request the name or phone number so we can search for the contact's person_id first.\n</think>\n\nTo proceed, I'll need **at least one identifying detail** about the contact you want to delete. Could you share:\n\n1. The **full name** of the contact, OR  \n2. Their **phone number**, OR  \n3. Their **relationship** to you (e.g., \"my dentist\", \"colleague from work\")?\n\nThis will let me search your contacts and show matching entries so you can confirm which one to delete. \n\n<example>\nFor example: \"Delete my brother Alex Johnson\" or \"Remove the contact with number (212) 555-7890\"\n</example>", "turn_idx": 2}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sorry, I still don't have any information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_vxcbstcmtzsa8axuhx0a0eho", "function": {"arguments": "{}", "name": "search_contacts"}, "type": "function"}], "turn_idx": 3}, {"tool_call_id": "call_vxcbstcmtzsa8axuhx0a0eho", "role": "tool", "name": "search_contacts", "content": "ValueError: No search criteria are given.

The user wants to delete a contact but doesn't have any information like person_id, name, phone number, or relationship. They've already said they don't have that info, so my previous attempt to call search_contacts with no arguments failed because it requires at least one criterion.\n\nHmm, so the problem is they can't provide any details. But the system needs some way to identify the contact. Maybe I should explain that without any info, it's impossible to delete the right contact. But the user might not realize that. Wait, the error message said \"No search criteria are given. At least one search criteria should be provided...\" So the function requires at least one parameter.\n\nWait, the user said they don't have any information. But maybe they can look through their contacts list? But since I can't access their actual contacts, I need to guide them. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the user is confused and thinks they can delete a contact without any info. But the system requires at least one detail. So I need to tell them that without any info, I can't proceed. But maybe there's a default? Like, if they have only one contact, but that's not safe to assume.\n\nWait, the search_contacts function without any parameters would return all contacts? But according to the error, it's invalid because no criteria are given. So the function requires at least one parameter. So the user needs to provide something.\n\nBut the user says they don't have any info. Maybe they can check their contacts list and provide a name or number. So I should prompt them again, maybe more clearly, that they need to give at least one detail, even if it's approximate.\n\nWait, the previous response from the assistant asked for name, phone, or relationship, but the user still said they don't have it. Now, after trying to call search_contacts with no args, which failed, I need to handle that error.\n\nSo the next step is to inform the user that without any details, it's impossible to find the contact to delete. Maybe suggest they check their contacts list for any details they can recall, even partial names or numbers. Or maybe they can list all contacts so they can identify the one to delete.\n\nBut the system's search_contacts function can't be called without parameters. So perhaps the user needs to provide at least one piece of information, even if it's a partial name (which would use fuzzy matching). For example, if they remember part of the name, like \"John\", the search can find contacts with names similar to that.\n\nSo the assistant should explain that even a partial name or number would help, and prompt the user again to provide any possible detail, no matter how small.\n</think>\n\nI understand you don't have specific details, but **I cannot safely delete a contact without any identifying information**. Without at least a name fragment, partial phone number, or relationship description, I risk deleting the wrong contact.\n\nCould you try to recall **any detail**, even if:\n- It's a partial name (\"Alex\" instead of \"Alexander\")\n- A fragment of a phone number (\"555\" from (555) 123-4567)\n- A vague relationship (\"my old coworker\" or \"dentist\")\n\n<example>\nFor example: \"Delete someone named 'Jen'\" or \"Remove a contact with '777' in the number\"\n</example>\n\nIf you truly have **zero information**, the only safe option is to **list all your contacts** so you can identify which one to delete. Would you like me to show your full contact list?", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sorry, I can't give any details. That's all I've got."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to delete a contact but doesn't have any information like name, phone number, or person_id. They've already said they can't provide any details.\n\nFirst, the system tried to get the person_id, but the user didn't have it. Then, the assistant asked for other details like name or phone number, but the user still couldn't provide anything. The next step was to search contacts with no criteria, which caused an error because the function requires at least one search parameter.\n\nNow, the user is saying they can't give any details. The problem is, without any criteria, the search_contacts function can't be called. But the user needs to delete a contact. The only way to proceed is to list all contacts so the user can identify which one to delete. However, the search_contacts function requires at least one parameter. Wait, looking back at the tool definition for search_contacts, the required fields are empty, meaning you can call it with no parameters? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the search_contacts parameters have \"required\": [] which means none are required. But the error message said \"No search criteria are given. At least one search criteria should be provided among...\". So even though the parameters aren't required, the function expects at least one to be provided. So calling search_contacts with no arguments is invalid.\n\nBut the user can't provide any details. So the assistant needs to find a way to list all contacts. Maybe the system allows searching with empty criteria, but the error says it's not allowed. So the assistant has to explain that they can't proceed without any info, but the user insists. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the search_contacts function with a very broad search, like a wildcard? But the tool's description says it uses exact or fuzzy matching. If no parameters are given, maybe it returns all contacts. But the error message indicates that the function requires at least one criteria. So the assistant can't call it without parameters.\n\nHmm. The user is stuck. The assistant needs to inform them that without any information, it's impossible to safely delete a contact, and the only option is to list all contacts. But how to do that if the search function requires at least one parameter.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use a parameter that's always true, like is_self=False? But the user might have multiple contacts. Alternatively, maybe the system allows omitting all parameters, but the error shows that's not the case.\n\nIn the previous step, when the user said they can't give details, the assistant tried to call search_contacts with no arguments, which caused an error. So the assistant can't do that.\n\nSo the correct response is to explain that without any details, it's impossible to proceed, and the user must provide at least some information. But the user keeps saying they can't. So the assistant should state that they can't help without any information and maybe suggest listing all contacts, but since the function requires parameters, perhaps the assistant can use a generic search like name=\"*\" or something, but the tool might not support wildcards.\n\nWait, the search_contacts function's parameters for name and relationship are fuzzy matched. Maybe if you provide a very short name like \"a\", it would return many results. But the user hasn't provided any info, so the assistant can't assume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should explain that the system requires at least one search term, so the user needs to provide even a single character. But the user says they can't.\n\nIn this case, the assistant's only option is to inform the user that without any information, deletion can't be done safely, and perhaps the user needs to check their contact list through another method. But since the user is interacting through this system, the assistant has to work within the tool constraints.\n\nWait, the error message from the tool says \"At least one search criteria should be provided\". So the assistant must include at least one parameter. But the user can't provide any. So the assistant is stuck. Therefore, the correct response is to tell the user that it's impossible without any details and that they must provide at least something, even if it's a guess.\n\nBut the user has already said they can't. So the assistant should reiterate that and maybe offer to list all contacts by using a very broad search, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the is_self parameter. If the user is trying to delete themselves, but the user said \"delete someone\", so probably not. But if the user sets is_self=False, but that's the default. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can search for contacts with empty fields, but that's not likely.\n\nHmm. The only way is to explain that without any criteria, the system can't proceed, and the user must provide at least one detail. Since the user insists they can't, the assistant has to state that deletion isn't possible under these circumstances.\n</think>\n\nI understand your situation, but **I cannot delete a contact without any identifying information**—this is a safety measure to prevent accidental deletion of the wrong contact. \n\nSince you’re unable to provide even a partial name, number, or relationship, the **only safe option** is to **list all your contacts** so you can identify which one to delete. However, my system requires **at least one search term** to show results (e.g., a single letter like \"a\" or a vague term like \"friend\"). \n\nWould you be comfortable trying one of these minimal searches?  \n- `name: \"a\"` (lists all contacts with names containing \"a\")  \n- `relationship: \" \"` (lists contacts with any relationship note)  \n\nIf not, I cannot proceed further without risking data loss.
