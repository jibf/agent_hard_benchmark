"<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to remove their upcoming reminder. First, I called get_current_timestamp to get the current time, which was 1755256022.906007. Then I used search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to that timestamp to find reminders that are upcoming (i.e., after the current time). But the response was an empty list, meaning there are no reminders scheduled after the current time.\n\nHmm, maybe the user has reminders that are exactly at the current time, but since the lowerbound is exclusive? Wait, the search_reminder function's description says \"Range matching timestamp with upperbound or lowerbound\". So if the reminder is set for exactly the current timestamp, would it be included? The lowerbound is probably inclusive, but maybe the user's reminders are all in the past. Wait, but the user said \"upcoming\", so maybe there are no upcoming reminders.\n\nWait, the problem is that the search returned empty. So there are no reminders with reminder_timestamp >= current timestamp. Therefore, there are no upcoming reminders to remove. So the correct response is to inform the user that there are no upcoming reminders. But the user asked to remove the upcoming reminder, so if there are none, we should tell them that.\n\nBut let me check again. The search_reminder was called with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound as the current timestamp. So it's looking for reminders where the reminder time is >= current time. If the result is empty, then there are no such reminders. Therefore, the answer is that there are no upcoming reminders to remove.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders scheduled after the current time.

But since the search for future reminders found nothing, the correct response is to inform them there are no upcoming reminders to remove. \n\nThe user might be confused, thinking they set a reminder but it's not there. I should explain that no upcoming reminders were found and maybe suggest checking if they remember any details, but since they don't have more info, just state there's nothing to remove.\n</think>\n\nThere are no upcoming reminders scheduled in your list.
