Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"upcoming\" means. Upcoming probably refers to a reminder that's set to trigger soon. But the system requires a specific reminder_id to remove it. So I can't just delete any reminder; I need to identify which one they're talking about.\n\nThe available tools include search_reminder, which can find reminders based on various criteria. Since the user mentioned \"upcoming,\" maybe the reminder is the next one in time. So I should search for reminders with a reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to some near future time. But how do I determine the current time?\n\nWait, I don't have access to the current time directly. However, maybe I can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to get the current timestamp. But to do that, I need the current year, month, day, etc. But the user didn't provide those. Hmm, but maybe the system can infer the current time based on when the request is made. However, as an AI, I don't have real-time data. So perhaps the search_reminder function can be used with a lower bound of the current time.\n\nWait, the search_reminder has parameters like reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. If I set the lowerbound to the current timestamp and upperbound to, say, current timestamp plus a day, that might find upcoming reminders. But without knowing the current timestamp, how can I set those bounds?\n\nAh, here's a thought: maybe I need to first get the current timestamp. To do that, I can use datetime_info_to_timestamp, but I need the current date and time. Since the user didn't provide it, maybe the system assumes that the current time is known. Wait, but as an AI, I don't have access to real-time data. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the system expects me to use the current time as the lower bound. But how? Maybe the search_reminder function, when given no parameters, returns all reminders, but the user wants the upcoming one. Alternatively, maybe \"upcoming\" means the next one, so I need to find the reminder with the earliest reminder_timestamp that's after the current time.\n\nBut without knowing the current time, I can't set the lower bound. So maybe I need to first get the current timestamp. How? The datetime_info_to_timestamp function requires year, month, day, etc. But since I don't have that info, maybe the system expects me to assume that the current time is available through another means. Wait, perhaps the timestamp_to_datetime_info function can be used in reverse, but no, it converts timestamp to datetime info.\n\nWait, maybe the system has a way to get the current time implicitly. For example, if I call timestamp_to_datetime_info with a timestamp of 0, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the shift_timestamp function can be used with a timestamp of 0, but that also doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is tricky. The user says \"upcoming,\" which is relative to now. But without knowing the current time, I can't define \"upcoming.\" So perhaps the correct approach is to first search for reminders where the reminder_timestamp is greater than the current time, but to do that, I need the current timestamp.\n\nWait, maybe the search_reminder function, if I don't specify any bounds, will return all reminders, and then I can sort them by reminder_timestamp to find the earliest one after now. But again, without knowing the current time, how do I know which ones are upcoming?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects me to assume that \"upcoming\" refers to the next reminder, so I should search for the reminder with the smallest reminder_timestamp that's in the future. But to do that, I need to compare against the current time.\n\nHmm. Since I can't get the current time directly, perhaps the correct step is to first call search_reminder without any parameters to get all reminders, then determine which one is upcoming. But the user probably has multiple reminders, and \"upcoming\" is ambiguous. However, the user says \"my upcoming reminder,\" implying there's one specific one they want to remove.\n\nWait, maybe the system has a default behavior where \"upcoming\" refers to the next one. So I need to find the reminder with the earliest reminder_timestamp that's after the current time.\n\nBut without the current time, I can't compute that. Therefore, perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp. How?\n\nWait, maybe the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used with the current date and time. But since I don't have that info, perhaps the system expects me to use the current time as known. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, 14:30:00, but I don't know that. As an AI, I don't have real-time data, so this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the tools are designed such that when you need the current time, you can use a combination of functions. For example, maybe the timestamp_to_datetime_info function can be called with a timestamp that's provided by another function, but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the search_reminder function, when given no parameters, returns all reminders, and then the assistant can process the results to find the upcoming one. But the assistant can't process the results; it has to make tool calls.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nBut in this case, the user said \"Remove my upcoming reminder.\" The ambiguity is what \"upcoming\" means. Is it the next one? The one today? The one within the next hour?\n\nSince the user didn't specify, according to the instructions, I should ask for clarification. However, the problem says \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So maybe the correct approach is to first search for reminders that are upcoming, which requires defining what upcoming means.\n\nBut without knowing the current time, I can't set the timestamp bounds. Therefore, perhaps the first step is to get the current timestamp. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the system expects that the current time is available via the datetime_info_to_timestamp function if we assume the current date. But since I don't have that data, I can't fill in the parameters.\n\nThis is a dead end. Given the instructions, if the request is ambiguous, I should ask for clarification. However, the user expects me to use the tools. Let me check the tools again.\n\nThe search_reminder function allows specifying reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. If I can get the current timestamp, I can set lowerbound to current time and upperbound to current time + 1 day, for example.\n\nBut to get the current timestamp, I need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, etc. Since I don't have that info, I can't call that function. Therefore, the only option is to ask the user to clarify what they mean by \"upcoming,\" or to assume that \"upcoming\" means the next reminder, but without the current time, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, but maybe the system has a way to get the current time implicitly. For example, perhaps when the search_reminder is called without timestamp bounds, it defaults to some behavior. But the description says \"Search results contains all reminder entries that matched all criteria,\" so if no criteria are given, it would return all reminders.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Call search_reminder with no parameters to get all reminders.\n2. From the results, identify the one with the earliest reminder_timestamp that's in the future.\n3. Then call remove_reminder with that reminder_id.\n\nBut the problem is that step 2 requires knowing the current time to determine which reminders are in the future. However, without the current time, I can't do that.\n\nWait, but maybe the search_reminder function can take a lowerbound of the current time if I can generate that timestamp. To generate the current timestamp, I need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp, but I don't have the current date/time values.\n\nThis seems like a catch-22. Given that, perhaps the correct action is to ask the user for more details, like which specific reminder they want to remove, or to confirm if they want to remove the next upcoming reminder.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, I should use the tools if possible. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that \"upcoming\" means the next reminder, so search for reminders where reminder_timestamp is the minimum value greater than now. But to do that, I need to know now.\n\nWait, maybe the system expects that the assistant can use the current time as known. For example, in a real system, the server would have the current time, so the assistant can use that. But as an AI, I don't, but perhaps in the context of this problem, I'm supposed to proceed as if I can get the current time.\n\nWait, perhaps the datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be called with the current date and time, but since I don't have that info, maybe the problem expects me to use placeholder values. But the instructions say not to make assumptions.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's look at the tools again.\n\nThe shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp and deltas. The timestamp_diff function calculates the difference between two timestamps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current time's components, but that requires a timestamp. If I had a timestamp, but I don't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system expects that the current timestamp is 0, but that's not realistic.\n\nGiven that the user's request is ambiguous because \"upcoming\" isn't specific, and without", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:22:01Z"}}
