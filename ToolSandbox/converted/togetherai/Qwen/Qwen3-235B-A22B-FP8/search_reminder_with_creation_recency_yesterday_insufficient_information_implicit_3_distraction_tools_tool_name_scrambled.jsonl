Let me check the available functions.\n\nFirst, there's the reminder_3 function which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. Since the user wants reminders created yesterday, I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday.\n\nTo get the current time, I might use utilities_7 to convert the current timestamp to date time info, but wait, the user hasn't provided the current time. Hmm, maybe I should assume the current time is now, but since the functions don't have access to real-time data, I need to ask the user for the current date and time or use a function to get it. Wait, no, the utilities functions can help here. Let me think.\n\nWait, the utilities_1 function converts date time to POSIX timestamp. If I can get the current timestamp, then subtract a day to get yesterday's start and end. But how do I get the current timestamp? The utilities_7 function can convert a timestamp to date time info, but I need a starting point. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the current time as of when the function is called. However, in this context, since the assistant can't know the real current time, perhaps the user would need to provide it. But that's not practical. Wait, maybe the system handles that internally. Let me proceed under the assumption that I can calculate yesterday's timestamp range using the utilities functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the current timestamp. Since the assistant can't get real-time data, perhaps the user's query implies that the current date is known, and I need to use the utilities functions to calculate yesterday's date. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the system to handle the current time automatically. This part is a bit unclear, but given the tools available, I should proceed with the functions provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects that \"yesterday\" is relative to the current time when the query is made. However, without knowing the current time, I can't compute it. So maybe the user's system provides the current time context. For the sake of this problem, let's assume that the current timestamp is known, and we can use the utilities_5 function to shift it back by one day.\n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? The utilities_7 function requires a timestamp as input. Alternatively, perhaps the system will handle that. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's creation timestamps.\n\nAssuming the current date is known, let's say the current timestamp is T. Yesterday would be T minus 24 hours. But to get the start and end of yesterday, perhaps we need to calculate the midnight of yesterday and midnight of today. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, yesterday is 2023-10-04, from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.\n\nTo do that, I can use utilities_7 to get the current date components, subtract one day, then use utilities_1 to get the start and end of that day.\n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the functions are designed to work with relative timestamps. Alternatively, perhaps the system automatically fills in the current timestamp. This is a bit confusing, but given the tools, here's a plan:\n\n1. Use utilities_7 with the current timestamp (assumed to be available) to get the current date components. Wait, but how do I get the current timestamp? Maybe the system provides it implicitly. Alternatively, perhaps the user's query is made in a context where the current timestamp is known. For example, if the user is interacting in real-time, the system might pass the current timestamp.\n\nBut since the assistant can't make assumptions, perhaps the correct approach is to use the utilities_5 function to subtract a day from the current timestamp. However, without knowing the current timestamp, this is not possible. Therefore, maybe the user's query needs to include the current date, but they didn't. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects that \"yesterday\" is relative to the current time when the query is made, and the assistant should use the system's current time. But since the functions can't access that, maybe the assistant should use the utilities functions to calculate based on a timestamp provided by the system. However, in this case, the assistant can't call functions that require parameters not provided by the user. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the reminder_3 function with the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound parameters set to the start and end of yesterday, but how to compute those timestamps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should first call utilities_1 to get the current date's timestamp, then subtract a day to get yesterday's start and end. Wait, but utilities_1 requires year, month, day, etc., which the user hasn't provided. Therefore, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Wait, maybe the user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which the assistant doesn't have. But the user might be assuming that the system knows the current date. However, given the tools, the assistant can't get the current timestamp. Therefore, perhaps the correct response is to ask the user to clarify with the current date or provide more information. But since the user's query is straightforward, maybe the assistant should proceed under the assumption that the current timestamp is known and calculate the lower and upper bounds accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should call utilities_7 with a placeholder timestamp. Wait, no, that's not possible. The assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the current date is needed to calculate yesterday's timestamp. However, the user might not know that and expects the system to handle it. \n\nWait, but maybe the system automatically provides the current timestamp when the utilities functions are called. For example, if the assistant calls utilities_7 without a timestamp, but the function requires it. So, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the current time as of when the function is called, but since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, that's not possible. \n\nGiven this impasse, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the assumption that the user wants to search for reminders created in the last 24 hours. However, that's not exactly the same as \"yesterday\" but could be a workaround. But \"yesterday\" refers to the day before today, not just the last 24 hours. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might need to use the utilities_5 function to subtract 24 hours from the current timestamp. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, this isn't possible. \n\nGiven that the user's query is ambiguous because the required parameters (timestamps for yesterday) can't be determined without additional information, the assistant should ask for clarification. However, the initial instruction says not to make assumptions and to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for \"yesterday's\" reminders. The assistant needs to determine if it can compute the correct timestamps. Maybe the assistant should proceed by using the current timestamp, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_7 function to get the current date components. But to use utilities_7, it needs a timestamp. The assistant can't get that timestamp without the user providing it. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nIn this case, the correct response is to inform the user that the current date and time are needed to determine yesterday's date. However, since the user might not have that information handy, perhaps the assistant should explain that to find reminders from yesterday, it needs to know the current date and time to calculate the correct timestamps. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided that information, so the assistant should ask for it. However, the initial instruction says to call the functions as needed. Since the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp, the correct action is to ask the user for the current date and time. But according to the problem statement, the assistant should only call the provided functions. \n\nWait, but the assistant can't ask the user questions. The initial instruction says to return the tool calls or a final answer. Therefore, the assistant must either make a tool call or provide an answer. Since the assistant can't get the current timestamp, perhaps it can't proceed and must respond that it can't answer without more information. But according to the tools, maybe there's a way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use relative time calculations. For example, if the current time is now, subtract one day (86400 seconds) and use that as the lower and upper bounds. But without knowing the current timestamp, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_5 function to shift a timestamp by -1 day. But again, without knowing the original timestamp, this isn't possible.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Given the constraints, the assistant must either make an assumption or respond that the query is ambiguous. Since the instructions say not to make assumptions, the correct approach is to state that the current date and time are needed to calculate yesterday's timestamps. However, since the assistant can't ask questions, it must either make a tool call or provide an answer. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should call the reminder_3 function with the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to a 24-hour window before the current time. But since the current timestamp isn't available, this isn't possible.\n\nIn this case,", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
