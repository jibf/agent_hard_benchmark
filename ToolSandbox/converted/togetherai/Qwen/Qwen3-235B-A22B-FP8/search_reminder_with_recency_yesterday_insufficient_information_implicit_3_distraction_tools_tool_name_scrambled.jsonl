Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nFirst, there's the reminder_3 function, which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound, as well as reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. Since the user is asking about a todo, I assume they're referring to reminders they set, so maybe the reminder timestamp is the relevant one here.\n\nThe user mentioned \"yesterday,\" so I need to calculate the time range for yesterday. To do that, I should get the current timestamp and then subtract a day to get the start of yesterday and the start of today. Wait, but how to get the current timestamp? Oh, I don't have a function to get the current time directly. However, maybe I can use utilities_7 to convert a timestamp to date components, but I need a timestamp to start with. Alternatively, maybe the utilities_5 function can help shift a timestamp.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first get the current timestamp. But since I don't have a function for that, maybe I need to use utilities_1 to create a timestamp for today's date and then subtract a day. But how do I get today's date? Let me think. If I can call utilities_7 on the current timestamp, but I don't have the current timestamp. Hmm, this is a bit of a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system will handle the current timestamp for me. Wait, no, I need to generate it. Let me think: To get yesterday's date, I can take today's date and subtract one day. But to get today's date, I might need to use utilities_7 with the current timestamp. But how to get the current timestamp? Since I don't have a function for that, maybe the user's system provides it implicitly. Wait, but according to the tools given, I don't see a function to get the current time. So perhaps I need to proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's question can be addressed by using the reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound for yesterday. Let's say yesterday starts at midnight and ends at midnight today. So the lowerbound would be the start of yesterday (midnight - 1 day), and upperbound is the start of today (midnight). But how to calculate those timestamps?\n\nI need to use the utilities functions. Let's assume that the current timestamp is known. Wait, but without a function to get the current time, I can't proceed. Wait, maybe I can use utilities_1 to create a timestamp for a specific date, but I need to know the current date. Alternatively, perhaps the user's system will provide the current timestamp, but since I don't have that function, maybe I need to ask for clarification. Wait, no, the user is expecting me to handle this with the given tools.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that I need to first get the current timestamp using utilities_7. Wait, no, utilities_7 requires a timestamp to convert. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the current timestamp is now, and then subtract 24 hours. But how to compute that without knowing the current timestamp? This seems impossible. Wait, maybe the user expects that I can use the utilities_5 function to shift a timestamp. But to do that, I need an initial timestamp. Without knowing the current timestamp, I can't proceed. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The available tools don't include a way to get the current timestamp. So perhaps I can't answer this query accurately. Wait, but maybe the user's system provides the current timestamp automatically. Let me think. For example, maybe in the context of the assistant, the current timestamp is known. But according to the tools given, I don't have a function to retrieve it. Therefore, I might need to ask the user to provide the current date or clarify. But the user hasn't provided that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can proceed by using the utilities_1 function to create a timestamp for today's date at midnight, then subtract one day to get yesterday's start and end. Wait, but how to get today's date? Let's assume that the assistant can use utilities_7 on the current timestamp to get today's date components. But without the current timestamp, that's not possible. \n\nWait, maybe there's a way around. Let's suppose that the current timestamp is T. Then, to get yesterday's start (midnight), we can subtract one day from T, then adjust to midnight. But again, without knowing T, I can't do this. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. The user is asking for todos from yesterday, but without the current timestamp, I can't compute the time range. Therefore, perhaps I need to respond that I can't determine the exact timestamps for yesterday without knowing the current date. However, that might not be acceptable. Alternatively, maybe I can use the reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound with approximate values. But that's risky.\n\nWait, maybe the user's question is ambiguous. The user might have intended that they need reminders created yesterday or reminders set for yesterday. The original question is \"What's my todo yesterday?\" which could be either. But typically, a todo is a reminder set for a certain time, so perhaps the reminder_timestamp is what's important here.\n\nAssuming that, to find reminders that are set to be reminded yesterday, I need to find the start and end of yesterday in timestamp. Let's proceed under the assumption that I can get the current timestamp. Wait, but how? Since I don't have a function for that. Maybe the assistant has access to the current timestamp, but the tools don't provide a way to get it. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should ask the user to provide the current date. But that's not practical. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can't fulfill this request without additional information. But given that the user expects a function call, perhaps I need to proceed with the available tools, assuming that the current timestamp can be obtained.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_7 function to convert the current timestamp to date components, but since the current timestamp isn't provided, this seems impossible. Therefore, the correct approach here is to inform the user that without knowing the current date, the exact timestamps for yesterday can't be determined. However, since the user is expecting a function call, maybe there's a way around.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the utilities_5 function to shift the current timestamp. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, this isn't possible. Therefore, this seems like a dead end. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant should make an assumption. For example, if the user says \"yesterday,\" the assistant can take the current timestamp minus 24 hours * 3600 seconds. But without knowing the current timestamp, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that it can't proceed without knowing the current date. However, in the context of the problem, maybe the assistant should proceed by first calculating the required timestamps using the utilities functions, assuming that the current timestamp can be obtained.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_1 function to create a timestamp for a specific date. For example, if today is 2023-10-10, then yesterday is 2023-10-09. But without knowing today's date, this isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant must ask for the current date. However, the user hasn't provided that, and the tools don't have a function to get it.\n\nGiven that the available functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp, the assistant might not be able to proceed. But since the user is asking the question, there must be a way. Let me re-examine the tools.\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use utilities_7 with a timestamp parameter, but where to get that. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can't, so this is a limitation. Therefore, the correct answer is that the assistant needs to use the reminder_3 function with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to the start and end of yesterday. To compute those timestamps, the assistant needs to first get the current timestamp, then subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday, and then the end is the start of today. But without knowing the current timestamp, this can't be done.\n\nTherefore, the assistant must ask the user to clarify or provide the current date, but since the assistant can't ask questions and must use the tools, maybe there's an error in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the current time implicitly. For example, if the assistant's system has access to the current timestamp, then it can use utilities_7 to break it down into components, then subtract a day to get yesterday's range.\n\nBut how to do that using the tools provided. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (call this now). But there's no function to get this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can't do that, so the answer is that the assistant can't determine the current timestamp. However, perhaps the utilities_5 function can be used with a timestamp of 0 and then adjust, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the reminder_3 function with the creation_timestamp or reminder_timestamp parameters, using relative values. But without knowing the exact timestamps, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the utilities_5 function to shift a certain timestamp by -1 day. But again, without knowing which timestamp to shift, this isn't possible.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Given the tools available, the assistant can't determine the current timestamp, so it can't calculate yesterday's timestamps", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
