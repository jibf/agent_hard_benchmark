Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's the reminder_3 function which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include reminder_id, content, creation and reminder timestamps with upper and lower bounds, and latitude/longitude. Since the user is asking about their todo items later, I probably need to find reminders that are scheduled for the future.\n\nThe user didn't specify any exact details like a specific date or content, so I might need to make some assumptions here. But wait, the instructions say not to assume values. Hmm. So maybe I should ask for clarification? But the user might expect a default behavior, like showing upcoming reminders.\n\nWait, the functions available include utilities to convert dates to timestamps. Maybe I can use the current time to set a lower bound for the reminder_timestamp. Since \"later\" is relative, perhaps I should get the current timestamp and then look for reminders with a reminder_timestamp greater than now.\n\nBut how do I get the current timestamp? There's utilities_7 which can convert a timestamp to date time info, but I need the current time. Wait, maybe I can't get the current time directly. The utilities functions allow shifting a timestamp, but without knowing the current timestamp, I can't do that. Unless the user provides a specific time, but they didn't.\n\nThis is a problem. The user is asking for \"later\" todos, but without knowing the current time or a specific reference point, I can't set the lower bound. So maybe I need to ask the user to clarify what they mean by \"later.\" Do they mean today's reminders, tomorrow's, or some specific time frame?\n\nAlternatively, if I can assume that \"later\" means after the current time, but since I don't have access to the real current time, I might need to use the utilities functions. Wait, but how? The user hasn't provided any specific dates or times to work with. Maybe I need to respond that I can't proceed without more information, or perhaps use the functions in a way that allows dynamic input.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_7 function to get the current timestamp. Wait, no, because the assistant can't execute functions without parameters. The utilities_7 requires a timestamp to convert. If I don't have a timestamp, I can't use that. So without the user providing a starting point, I can't determine the current time.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach here is to inform the user that I need more specific information to perform the search. For example, they could specify a date or time range for \"later.\" Otherwise, I can't accurately determine what \"later\" refers to. The reminder_3 function requires explicit parameters, and without them, I can't proceed. So the answer should be to ask the user to clarify with specific time details or provide a reference point.\n</think>\n\nTo check your upcoming reminders (\"todo later\"), I need specific details like a date/time range or location to search for. Could you clarify with something like \"reminders after today\" or \"reminders this week\"?", "turn_idx": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can't really specify any details like that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_9hsusd94p4l13t9sdb2pun5z", "function": {"arguments": "{}", "name": "reminder_3"}, "type": "function"}], "turn_idx": 2}, {"tool_call_id": "call_9hsusd94p4l13t9sdb2pun5z", "role": "tool", "name": "reminder_3", "content": "ValueError: No search criteria are given.

They responded that they can't specify any details. So, I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I called the reminder_3 function without any arguments, thinking maybe it would return all reminders. But the error said at least one search criteria is needed. That makes sense because searching without any criteria might be too broad or not allowed by the system.\n\nNow, the user can't provide specific details, so I need another approach. Maybe I can use the current time to find upcoming reminders. Since \"todo later\" implies reminders that are scheduled for the future, I can set a lower bound on the reminder_timestamp to be the current time. That way, any reminders set after now would be considered \"todo later.\"\n\nTo do this, I need to get the current POSIX timestamp. The utilities_7 function can convert a timestamp to date time info, but I need the current timestamp. Alternatively, I can use the utilities_1 function to create a timestamp for the current time. Wait, but how do I get the current time? The system might have a way, but in the given functions, there's no direct way to get the current time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that \"todo later\" refers to reminders that are scheduled after the current time. So, I can use the current time as a lower bound for reminder_timestamp. Since I don't have a function to get the current timestamp directly, perhaps I need to use utilities_1 to construct it. But I don't have the current date and time values. This is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects the system to know the current time. But given the available functions, the assistant can't directly fetch the current timestamp. So, perhaps the best approach is to inform the user that without any criteria, including a time range, the system can't retrieve the reminders. Or maybe the assistant can use a default time range, like the next 24 hours, but again, without knowing the current time, that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the assistant might need to ask the user to confirm if they want reminders starting from now, even if they can't specify the exact time. But the user already said they can't specify details. So, maybe the assistant should explain that it's not possible to retrieve all reminders without any criteria, and suggest that perhaps a default time range (like the next day) could be used. But since the functions require at least one criteria, the assistant must find a way to get that input from the user.\n\nIn the error message, the system says at least one criteria is needed. So, the assistant needs to prompt the user to provide at least one criteria, even if it's a general one. For example, \"reminders for the next week\" or \"reminders with content related to 'meeting'\". But the user might not have any specific info. Maybe the assistant can suggest using a recent time frame, like today or tomorrow.\n\nBut given the previous interaction, the user might not want to provide any details. So, the assistant has to handle this by either making an assumption (which might not be safe) or explain that without any criteria, the search can't be performed. The correct approach here is to inform the user that at least one search criteria is required and offer examples of possible criteria they can provide, even if they're general.\n</think>\n\nI understand you might not have specific details, but I need at least one search criteria to retrieve your reminders. For example:\n- \"Reminders scheduled after today\"\n- \"Reminders with 'meeting' in the content\"\n- \"Reminders created in the last 24 hours\"\n\nWould any of these work for your needs?", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can't give specific details right now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is saying they can't give specific details right now. Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nFirst, the previous attempts tried to get them to specify some criteria, but they're insisting they can't. The error from the tool says at least one search criteria is needed. So, I need to find a way to help them without them providing explicit details.\n\nMaybe I can offer default options or make an assumption based on common scenarios. For example, maybe they want to see all reminders, but the system requires at least one filter. Alternatively, perhaps I can suggest a broad search that covers a typical timeframe, like the next 7 days.\n\nWait, the reminder_3 function allows for fuzzy matching on content, exact on reminder_id, and ranges on timestamps. Since they can't specify anything else, maybe I can set a default time range, like upcoming reminders within the next week. But how do I get the current timestamp to calculate that?\n\nI can use utilities_7 to get the current timestamp. Then, add a week to it using utilities_5. Wait, but the user hasn't given any permission to use their current time. However, maybe it's a safe assumption to use the current time as a reference point for \"later\".\n\nSo, steps:\n1. Use utilities_7 to get the current timestamp.\n2. Use utilities_5 to add 7 days to the current timestamp to get an upper bound.\n3. Use reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to that future timestamp.\n\nBut I need to call these functions step by step. Let me check the functions available. Yes, utilities_7 can get the current timestamp, then utilities_5 can shift it by 7 days. Then, use that upperbound in reminder_3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants all reminders, but the system requires a filter. If they can't provide any, maybe the best approach is to inform them that without any criteria, the system can't retrieve the data. But since they might want to see all reminders, perhaps the function can be called with a very broad range, but that's not possible without any parameters.\n\nWait, the error from the tool says that no search criteria are given. So, the function reminder_3 requires at least one parameter. The user can't provide any, so I need to find a way to generate a default parameter.\n\nIf the user can't specify anything, maybe the best approach is to suggest a default search like reminders in the next 24 hours or something. But to calculate that, I need the current timestamp.\n\nSo, first, call utilities_7 to get the current timestamp. Then, calculate the upperbound by adding 24 hours. Then, call reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to that value.\n\nLet me structure the tool calls accordingly. First, get the current timestamp, then shift it by 24 hours (which is 1 day), then use that as the upperbound for the reminder timestamp.\n\nWait, the utilities_5 function allows shifting by days. So, steps:\n\n1. Call utilities_7 to get the current timestamp.\n2. Call utilities_5 with the current timestamp and days=1 to get tomorrow's timestamp.\n3. Use reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to that future timestamp.\n\nBut the user might want a different timeframe. However, since they can't specify, maybe 24 hours is a reasonable default. Alternatively, a week. But I need to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to see all reminders, but the system can't do that without a filter. So, the assistant has to make an assumption here. Since the user said \"todo later,\" maybe \"later\" could be the next 7 days.\n\nSo, first, get the current timestamp using utilities_7.\n\nThen, add 7 days using utilities_5.\n\nThen, use that upperbound in reminder_3.\n\nThis way, the search is for reminders scheduled within the next week.\n\nBut I need to make sure the functions are called correctly. Let's outline the tool calls:\n\nFirst, call utilities_7 with no parameters (since it just needs the current timestamp). Wait, no, utilities_7 requires a timestamp parameter. Wait, looking back at the tool definitions:\n\nutilities_7: {\"name\": \"utilities_7\", \"description\": \"Convert POSIX timestamp to a dictionary of date time information...\", \"parameters\": {\"timestamp\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"required\"}}}\n\nWait, no. To get the current timestamp, utilities_7 needs a timestamp. But how do I get the current timestamp in the first place? The user hasn't provided it. Wait, maybe the function utilities_7 can be used in combination with another function. Wait, maybe the assistant can assume that the current timestamp is the current time when the function is called. But the problem is, the assistant can't know that unless the function can retrieve it.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. The utilities_7 function takes a timestamp as input and converts it to date time info. So, to get the current timestamp, the assistant would need to have that value. But since the assistant can't know the current time without a function, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the fact that the utilities_1 function can convert a date time to a timestamp. But to use that, the assistant would need to know the current date and time. Which again, without the user providing it, that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this seems like a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed without any parameters, so the error message should be adjusted to prompt the user again, but the user has already said they can't provide details.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use a very broad time range. For example, if the user says \"todo later,\" maybe reminders with a timestamp in the future. But to determine that, the assistant needs to know the current timestamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the utilities_7 function without parameters? No, the parameters are required. Wait, looking back:\n\nutilities_7's parameters: {\"timestamp\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"required\": [\"timestamp\"]}}\n\nSo, the assistant can't call utilities_7 without a timestamp. Therefore, without the user providing a timestamp or allowing the assistant to use the current real-time timestamp, which it can't access unless there's a function for that, but there isn't.\n\nWait, the user's original query is \"What's on my todo later?\" and they can't specify any details. So, the assistant has to find a way to proceed with zero information. But according to the tool's requirements, at least one parameter is needed. Therefore, the assistant must make an assumption or inform the user that without any criteria, it can't proceed.\n\nBut the user has already said they can't provide any details, so maybe the only option is to inform them that the system can't retrieve all reminders without at least one criteria. Therefore, the assistant has to apologize and explain that some minimal information is required, like a timeframe or keyword, even if it's broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use a fuzzy match on content with an empty string? But the function's parameters for content say it's a string, and fuzzy matched. If the user didn't provide any content, maybe leaving it empty isn't allowed. The error message from the tool says \"No search criteria are given. At least one search criteria should be provided...\", so even if content is an empty string, it might not count as a criteria.\n\nSo, in that case, the assistant can't proceed without at least one parameter. Therefore, the correct response is to explain that some minimal input is required and offer examples again.\n</think>\n\nI understand you might not have specific details, but I need at least one search criteria to retrieve your reminders. For example:\n- \"Reminders scheduled in the next 7 days\"\n- \"Reminders with 'urgent' in the content\"\n- \"Reminders created today\"\n\nWould any of these work for your needs?", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "I can't supply any details right now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is saying they can't supply any details right now. Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nFirst, the previous attempts to get them to specify some criteria for the reminders search didn't work. They might not know the exact details or are unsure how to phrase it. But the system requires at least one search criterion to proceed. \n\nLooking at the tools available, the reminder_3 function requires at least one parameter. Since the user can't provide any, maybe I can offer a default or a very broad search. But the system doesn't allow that, as per the error message. So the assistant can't proceed without any criteria.\n\nI need to communicate this clearly but politely. Maybe suggest some common scenarios or default ranges that they can choose from. For example, if they don't specify, perhaps search for upcoming reminders in the next 24 hours or something like that. But since the user hasn't agreed to any, I can't assume. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can explain that without any criteria, it's impossible to retrieve the data. So the response should be firm but helpful, offering examples again but respecting the user's inability to provide details. \n\nWait, but the user might be expecting the system to have a default behavior. However, according to the function definition, no parameters are required, but at least one must be provided. So the function allows any combination, but not none. \n\nIn this case, the assistant needs to inform the user that they need at least one criterion. Since the user keeps refusing, maybe the assistant should end the loop and state that it can't proceed without any information. But the previous responses kept asking, so maybe the user is expecting a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use a very broad search, like all reminders, but the function doesn't allow that. The error message says that no criteria are given, so the assistant must prompt again. \n\nThe key is to balance between being helpful and adhering to the system's constraints. The assistant can't proceed without any criteria, so it's necessary to inform the user again, perhaps more clearly that they need to provide at least one detail, even if it's a general one. \n\nSo the next step is to reiterate that at least one criterion is needed and offer examples again, but in a way that's easy to choose. Maybe simplify the options further or make it clear that even a vague term like \"soon\" can be used. \n\nAlternatively, check if other functions can help. For example, maybe using utilities to get the current time and set a default range. But the user hasn't allowed that. \n\nIn the end, the assistant must adhere to the system's requirements and can't make assumptions. So the response should be that without any criteria, the search can't be performed. The user might need to provide at least one detail, even if it's a very broad one.\n</think>\n\nI'm unable to proceed without at least one search criterion to filter reminders. Even a general term like \"upcoming\" or \"recent\" would help me define a time range. For example:\n- \"Reminders scheduled in the next 24 hours\"\n- \"Reminders created this week\"\n- \"Reminders with 'project' in the content\"\n\nCould you provide any of these minimal details?", "turn_idx": 5}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 9, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
