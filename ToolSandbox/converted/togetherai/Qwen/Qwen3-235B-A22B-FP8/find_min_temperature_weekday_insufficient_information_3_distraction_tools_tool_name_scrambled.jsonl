Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what date corresponds to this Friday. Since today's date isn't provided, I might need to get the current date and find the upcoming Friday. But wait, the user might be referring to the current week's Friday. However, without knowing today's date, I can't calculate that. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use the current date as of when the question is asked. But since I don't have access to real-time data, I might need to use the utilities provided to convert a timestamp. Wait, the utilities include converting date time to POSIX and vice versa. \n\nWait, the user might not have given a specific date, so maybe the question is ambiguous. Let me check the tools again. The functions available are for converting date time to POSIX (utilities_1) and POSIX to date time (utilities_7), and a search tool for addresses based on latitude and longitude. But there's no weather-related function here. Oh, the user is asking about temperature, but none of the provided tools can retrieve weather data. \n\nSo, the problem is that the available functions don't include a way to get weather information. The user's question requires accessing temperature data, which isn't possible with the given tools. Therefore, I should inform the user that I can't answer their question because the necessary tool isn't available. Alternatively, maybe I can point out that I can't retrieve weather data but can help with date conversions if they need that instead.\n\nWait, but maybe the user expects me to use another function. Let me double-check. The tools are rapid_api_search_tools_1 (address from lat/long), utilities_1 (date to POSIX), and utilities_7 (POSIX to date). No weather functions. Therefore, the correct response is that I can't provide the temperature as it's outside the available tools. I should make sure not to make up any data or try to use a function that doesn't exist. So, the answer is to state that I can't assist with that query using the provided tools.\n</think>\n\nThe functions provided do not include access to weather or temperature data.
