reminder yesterday?\" So I need to figure out how to retrieve their reminders from yesterday. Let me start by understanding what functions I have available.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's the reminder_3 function which allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. The parameters include creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound, as well as reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. Since the user is asking about reminders from yesterday, I need to determine whether they're referring to when the reminder was created or when it was set to remind. The question is a bit ambiguous here. However, \"yesterday\" likely refers to the time when the reminder was supposed to trigger, so the reminder_timestamp.\n\nBut wait, the user might also be referring to reminders they set yesterday, meaning the creation time. Hmm. To cover both possibilities, but since the query is about what was on their reminder yesterday, it's more probable they want reminders that were due yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be within yesterday's date range.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the POSIX timestamps for the start and end of yesterday. To do that, I can use utilities_2 to get the current timestamp. Then, shift it by -1 days to get the start of yesterday (midnight) and the start of today (midnight) as the upper bound.\n\nWait, how to get the start of yesterday? Let me think. Let's get the current timestamp with utilities_2. Then, subtract one day to get to the same time yesterday. But to get the lower bound (start of yesterday), I need to go to midnight. So perhaps first get the current timestamp, then subtract the number of seconds since midnight yesterday. Alternatively, use utilities_7 to convert the current timestamp to date time info, then subtract one day, set the time to 00:00:00, convert back to timestamp for lowerbound, and add 24 hours for upperbound.\n\nBut that might require multiple steps. Alternatively, since the current timestamp is known, subtract 24 hours to get a point 24 hours ago, then find the start of the day for that timestamp. Alternatively, use utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp back by one day and zero hours, minutes, seconds to get the start of yesterday. Wait, maybe it's easier to get today's midnight and subtract 24 hours for the lower bound, and then today's midnight as upper bound. Wait, no. Let's break it down:\n\nToday's midnight can be found by taking the current timestamp, converting to date time, setting hour, minute, second to 0, then converting back. Alternatively, using utilities_7 to get the current date time, subtract one day from that to get yesterday's date, then set the time to 00:00:00 for lowerbound and 23:59:59 for upperbound.\n\nBut with the available functions, I can get the current timestamp with utilities_2. Then, use utilities_7 to convert it to date time info. Then, subtract one day from the date. Then convert that date (yesterday's date at 00:00:00) to a timestamp for lowerbound, and same date at 23:59:59 to upperbound. But how to convert that adjusted date back to a timestamp? The utilities_1 function can convert date time to timestamp. So steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with utilities_2.\n2. Convert current timestamp to date time info (utilities_7) to get today's date.\n3. Subtract one day from the date to get yesterday's date.\n4. Use utilities_1 to convert yesterday 00:00:00 to timestamp (lowerbound).\n5. Use utilities_1 to convert yesterday 23:59:59 to timestamp (upperbound).\n6. Then, use reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound to find reminders in that range.\n\nBut the problem is that each function call is separate. So I need to do this step by step. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only call functions one after another, but the assistant's thinking process is in a single step. Wait, but in the context of a conversation, the assistant can make multiple tool calls. Wait, but in the current prompt, the user's query is a single message. So the assistant needs to figure out the necessary steps and make multiple tool calls as needed.\n\nBut according to the instructions, for each function call, the assistant should return a JSON object within tool_call tags. However, the assistant might need to chain function calls. For example, first get the current timestamp, then convert it to date time, adjust the date, then convert back to timestamps for the bounds, then finally call reminder_3. But since each function call is a separate step, the assistant would need to perform each step in sequence. However, in the current setup, the assistant is expected to generate the first tool call and then wait for the response before proceeding. But since this is a single interaction, perhaps the assistant should plan all necessary steps and make the necessary tool calls in sequence. However, the example in the prompt shows that the assistant can generate multiple tool calls in the response. Wait, looking back at the initial instructions: \"For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within XML tags.\" So the assistant can return multiple tool calls in the response if needed.\n\nBut in the case of the user's query, the assistant needs to first get the current timestamp, then process it to find the start and end of yesterday, then use those timestamps to query the reminders. Therefore, the assistant would need to make the following tool calls:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n2. Call utilities_7 with the current timestamp to get date time info.\n3. Then, subtract one day from the date, set time to 00:00:00 and 23:59:59.\n4. Call utilities_1 to convert those adjusted dates to timestamps.\n5. Finally, call reminder_3 with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations itself, it must use the functions. So first, get the current timestamp. Then convert to date time. Then, to get yesterday's date, subtract one day. But how to subtract one day? The assistant can use utilities_5 to shift the timestamp by -1 day. Wait, utilities_5 allows shifting a timestamp by deltas. So perhaps a better approach is:\n\n- Get current timestamp with utilities_2.\n- Use utilities_5 to subtract 1 day, resulting in a timestamp one day earlier. But to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe the assistant needs to adjust the time components. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can subtract 24 hours, but that might not account for daylight saving changes. Alternatively, the correct way is to get today's midnight and subtract 24 hours for each day.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to first get today's midnight. Let's think: current timestamp is T. To get today's midnight, convert T to date time (utilities_7), then set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp (utilities_1). Then subtract 24 hours from that to get yesterday's midnight. So:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp T.\n2. Call utilities_7 with T to get today's date and time.\n3. Set hour, minute, second to 0 in the date time info to get today's midnight.\n4. Call utilities_1 with today's midnight to get T_midnight.\n5. Call utilities_5 with T_midnight, days=-1 to get yesterday's midnight (T_yesterday_midnight).\n6. Then, T_yesterday_upper = T_midnight (today's midnight is the upper bound for yesterday).\n7. Then, call reminder_3 with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound=T_yesterday_midnight and upperbound=T_yesterday_upper.\n\nWait, because yesterday's day starts at T_yesterday_midnight and ends at T_midnight (today's midnight). So the lowerbound would be T_yesterday_midnight and upperbound T_midnight.\n\nAlternatively, the lowerbound is T_midnight - 86400 seconds (24 hours) and upperbound is T_midnight.\n\nBut how to compute T_midnight?\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp T via utilities_2.\n2. Convert T to date time info (year, month, day, etc.) using utilities_7.\n3. Create a new date time with same year, month, day, but hour=0, minute=0, second=0.0.\n4. Convert this back to timestamp using utilities_1 to get T_midnight.\n5. Then, subtract 86400 seconds (24 hours) from T_midnight to get T_yesterday_midnight. This can be done via utilities_5 with days=-1.\n\nWait, using utilities_5 with timestamp=T_midnight, days=-1 would subtract one day, which is exactly 24 hours, resulting in T_yesterday_midnight.\n\nThen, the lowerbound is T_yesterday_midnight, upperbound is T_midnight.\n\nTherefore, any reminders that occurred between yesterday's midnight and today's midnight would be considered as happening yesterday.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n- Call utilities_7 on that timestamp to get today's date components.\n- Convert back to midnight today using utilities_1 with hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n- Then shift that back one day to get yesterday's midnight.\n- Use these two timestamps (yesterday's midnight and today's midnight) as the lower and upper bounds for", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
