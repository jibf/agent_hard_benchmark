So I tried to turn it on with set_location_service_status, but there was a permission error because low battery mode is enabled. \n\nNow, I need to check if low battery mode is on. The response from get_low_battery_mode_status was True. That explains why the location service couldn't be turned on. \n\nThe next step is to suggest turning off low battery mode to allow location services. I should inform the user that they need to disable low battery mode first. \n\nI should also provide instructions on how to do that, maybe through the settings menu. Once low battery mode is off, they can try enabling location services again. \n\nI need to make sure the explanation is clear and the steps are easy to follow. Let me put that together in a helpful response.\n</think>\n\nTo enable location services, you need to disable low battery mode first. Here's how:\n\n1. Go to **Settings > Battery**\n2. Toggle off **Low Battery Mode**\n3. Wait a moment, then go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services**\n4.
