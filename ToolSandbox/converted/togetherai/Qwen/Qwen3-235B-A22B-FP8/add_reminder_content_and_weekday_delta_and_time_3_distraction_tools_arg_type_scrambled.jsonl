Let me figure out how to set that up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the correct timestamp for next Friday's 5 PM. But wait, is the user referring to the upcoming Friday or the one after if today is already Friday? Hmm, the term \"next Friday\" can sometimes be ambiguous. However, typically, \"next Friday\" usually means the first Friday after this week. But to be precise, maybe I should check the current date and calculate accordingly. However, since the user hasn't provided the current date, I might need to rely on the system's current timestamp.\n\nWait, the tools available include get_current_timestamp. So first, I should get the current timestamp to figure out the date for next Friday. Let me start by calling get_current_timestamp. That will give me the current time in POSIX format. Then, I can use timestamp_to_datetime_info to break down the current date and time to find out what day of the week it is. \n\nOnce I have the current day of the week, I can calculate how many days until next Friday. For example, if today is Wednesday, next Friday is in 2 days. If today is Friday, then \"next Friday\" would be in 7 days. Wait, but some people might consider \"next Friday\" as the following week if today is Friday. But I need to handle that. So, after getting the current date info, I can compute the days needed to reach the next Friday.\n\nBut maybe there's a function to handle shifting the timestamp. Once I have the current timestamp, I can calculate the number of days needed to reach the next Friday. For instance, if today is Monday (isoweekday 1), then next Friday is 4 days away. If today is Friday (isoweekday 5), then next Friday is 7 days away. Wait, the isoweekday ranges from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday). So Friday is 5. So, to get next Friday's date, the logic would be:\n\ncurrent_day = isoweekday\ndays_until_friday = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7\nif days_until_friday == 0, then it's 7 days to next Friday (if today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later)\nWait, no. If today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. So days_until_friday would be 7 if current_day is 5. But (5-5 +7) mod7 is 0, but 0 mod7 is 0. Hmm, maybe that formula isn't correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Calculate the number of days to add to get to the next Friday. If today is Friday, add 7 days. Otherwise, calculate the difference. For example:\n\nIf today is Monday (1), next Friday is 4 days later (1 +4 =5).\nIf today is Friday (5), next Friday is 7 days later.\nIf today is Saturday (6), next Friday is 6 days later (6-5=1 day ago, so next Friday is 6 days ahead).\n\nWait, maybe the formula is:\n\ndays_until_friday = (5 - current_day) % 7\nif days_until_friday == 0:\n    days_until_friday =7\n\nBut wait, (5 - current_day) mod7 gives the days until Friday, but if it's already Friday, that would be 0, so we set it to 7. That seems right.\n\nSo after getting the current datetime info, including isoweekday, calculate days_until_friday as (5 - isoweekday) if (5 - isoweekday) !=0 else 7. Wait, but (5 - isoweekday) could be negative. Let me check. For example, if today is Saturday (6), then 5-6= -1, mod7 would be 6. Hmm, but if we don't mod, then days_until_friday would be negative. So maybe the correct approach is:\n\ncurrent_day = isoweekday\nif current_day <5:\n    days_until_friday =5 - current_day\nelif current_day >5:\n    days_until_friday = (7 - current_day) +5\nelse: # current_day is 5 (Friday)\n    days_until_friday =7\n\nSo for example:\nMonday: 5-1=4\nTuesday:3\nWednesday:2\nThursday:1\nFriday:7\nSaturday: (7-6)+5=1+5=6?\nWait, wait, Saturday is 6, so next Friday would be 6 days ahead? Wait, Saturday to next Friday is 6 days. Sunday (7) to next Friday is 5 days.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of days from today to next Friday. If today is Friday, then next Friday is 7 days later. For other days:\n\nIf today is before Friday (Monday to Thursday), subtract current_day from 5.\n\nIf today is Friday, add 7.\n\nIf today is Saturday or Sunday, subtract current_day from 12 (since 5 (Friday) +7=12 when considering next week).\n\nWait, maybe another way:\n\ndays_until_friday = (5 - current_day + 7) %7\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\ncurrent_day=1 (Monday): (5-1+7)=11 mod7=4. Correct.\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. Hmm, that gives 0. So maybe add 7 if it's zero.\n\nSo days_until_friday = (5 - current_day +7) %7. If the result is 0, then set to 7.\n\nWait, current_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. So set days_until_friday=7.\n\ncurrent_day=6 (Saturday): (5-6+7)=6 mod7=6. So 6 days. Which is correct.\n\ncurrent_day=7 (Sunday): (5-7+7)=5 mod7=5. So 5 days. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\ndays_until_friday = (5 - current_day +7) %7\n\nif days_until_friday ==0: days_until_friday=7.\n\nWait, but (5 - current_day +7) mod7 is same as (12 - current_day) mod7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, (5 - current_day +7) %7 = (12 - current_day) %7.\n\nBut regardless, the result gives the days until next Friday, except when current_day is Friday, which gives 0, which we need to replace with 7.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. So days_until_friday=0. So we need to set it to 7.\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6+7)=6 mod7=6. So 6 days.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n\n2. Convert to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n\n3. Calculate days_until_friday as (5 - isoweekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, set to 7.\n\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_until_friday days to get the Friday's date.\n\nThen, set the time to 5 PM (17:00). So adjust the timestamp to 17:00 on that day.\n\nWait, but how to adjust the time? Because the current timestamp has the current time. So after adding days_until_friday days, we need to set the hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n\nBut the shift_timestamp function can only shift by deltas. So if the current time is 10 AM, adding days_until_friday days would set it to 10 AM on Friday. Then we need to adjust the hour to 17, so adding (17-10) hours, and zero minutes and seconds.\n\nBut the user didn't specify AM or PM. Wait, 5PM is 17:00.\n\nWait, but the user said \"5PM\", so that's clear.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Get current timestamp (using get_current_timestamp)\n\n- Convert to datetime info (using timestamp_to_datetime_info) to get year, month, day, hour, minute, second, isoweekday.\n\n- Calculate days_until_friday as (5 - isoweekday +7) %7. If the result is 0, set to 7.\n\n- Shift the current timestamp by days_until_friday days. Also, adjust hours and minutes.\n\nWait, but shifting by days, then setting the hour to 17:00, which may require adjusting hours, minutes, etc.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the date for next Friday, then create a timestamp for that date at 17:00.\n\nBut to create a timestamp, we need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp function, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (ts_current).\n\n2. Convert to datetime info (dt_current) to get current date and time.\n\n3. Calculate days_until_friday as (5 - dt_current['isoweekday'] +7) %7. If 0, set to 7.\n\n4. Calculate the date of next Friday: add days_until_friday days to current date. How?\n\n   a. Use shift_timestamp to add days_until_friday days to ts_current.
