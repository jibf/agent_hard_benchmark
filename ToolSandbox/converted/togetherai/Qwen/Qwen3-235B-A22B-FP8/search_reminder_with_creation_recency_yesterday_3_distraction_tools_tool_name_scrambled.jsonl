they created yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to use the reminder_3 function to search for reminders. The key here is the creation timestamp. The user mentioned \"yesterday,\" so I need to calculate the timestamp for yesterday's date and set a range.\n\nTo get yesterday's date, I should start with the current timestamp. Using utilities_2 to get the current time. Then subtract one day using utilities_5. Wait, but how do I handle the exact time? Maybe set the lower and upper bounds to cover the entire day of yesterday.\n\nFor example, if today is October 10th, then yesterday is October 9th. The lowerbound would be the start of October 9th (00:00:00) and upperbound the end of October 9th (23:59:59). But how to calculate those times?\n\nAlternatively, subtract one day from the current timestamp to get a point in time 24 hours ago, but that might not cover the entire day. Wait, maybe the user wants all reminders created within the last 24 hours? Or exactly yesterday's date regardless of the current time.\n\nHmm, \"yesterday\" typically refers to the full day before today. So if today is the 10th, then the 9th. So I need to get the timestamp for the start of yesterday (midnight) and the end (next midnight minus a second). \n\nBut how to calculate that. Let's see. Using utilities_2 to get current timestamp. Then convert that to a date using utilities_7 to get year, month, day. Then subtract one day, set the time to 00:00:00 for lowerbound, and 23:59:59 for upperbound. But wait, maybe there's a simpler way by using utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp by -1 day, then adjust the time components?\n\nAlternatively, maybe get the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get a lower bound, and then subtract another 24 hours to get the upper bound? No, that's not precise. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to get the current timestamp, then shift it by -1 day using utilities_5. But wait, utilities_5 allows shifting by weeks, days, etc. So for example, shift the current timestamp by -1 day. But that would give a timestamp exactly 24 hours ago. However, if the current time is 3 PM, then 24 hours ago is yesterday at 3 PM. But the user wants all reminders created any time yesterday, not just the past 24 hours. So that approach might miss reminders created before that.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to find the start of yesterday (midnight) and the end of yesterday (11:59:59 PM). Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp using utilities_2. Then convert that to a date using utilities_7. Then subtract one day from that date to get yesterday's date. Then create a timestamp for that day at 00:00:00 (lowerbound) and 23:59:59 (upperbound). But how to create those timestamps?\n\nWait, maybe using utilities_1 to create the lowerbound. For example, if today's date is year Y, month M, day D, then yesterday is D-1. So create a date for Y, M, D-1, 0,0,0. Then convert that to a timestamp using utilities_1. Similarly, upperbound is Y, M, D-1, 23,59,59. But converting those to timestamps would give the exact bounds for the entire day of yesterday.\n\nBut how do I get today's date components? By using utilities_7 on the current timestamp. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current_timestamp.\n2. Call utilities_7 with current_timestamp to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Subtract 1 from day to get yesterday's date. (Need to handle month/year rollover, but the function should handle that)\n4. Use utilities_1 to create lowerbound_timestamp with yesterday's year, month, day, 0,0,0.\n5. Use utilities_1 to create upperbound_timestamp with yesterday's year, month, day, 23,59,59.\n\nThen, in the reminder_3 function, set creation_timestamp_lowerbound to lowerbound_timestamp and creation_timestamp_upperbound to upperbound_timestamp.\n\nBut since the user can't input multiple steps, I need to do this all in one go. However, as a function call, I can only call one function. Wait, but the assistant can chain function calls. But in the problem statement, the assistant is supposed to call the necessary functions. However, the user's query might require multiple steps.\n\nWait, but according to the tools provided, the assistant can only call the functions listed. So, the assistant needs to figure out how to calculate the lower and upper bounds using the available functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to get the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) and use that as the lower bound, and the current timestamp as the upper bound. But that would include reminders created in the last 24 hours, which is not exactly the same as \"yesterday\". For example, if today is 10th 3 PM, then 24 hours ago is 9th 3 PM. So the range would be from 9th 3 PM to 10th 3 PM. But the user's \"yesterday\" refers to the full day of the 9th, regardless of the current time. So this approach would miss reminders created between 9th 00:00 and 9th 3 PM, and include reminders from 10th 00:00 to 10th 3 PM.\n\nTherefore, that's not accurate. So the correct approach requires getting the start and end of yesterday.\n\nBut how to do that with the available functions.\n\nAnother way: use utilities_7 to get the current date components, subtract one day from the day component, then create the lower and upper timestamps.\n\nBut to do that, the assistant would need to make multiple function calls. However, in the context of the problem, each turn allows the assistant to make one or more tool calls. Since the user's question is a single turn, perhaps the assistant can chain multiple function calls.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Call utilities_2 to get current_timestamp.\n2. Call utilities_7 on current_timestamp to get year, month, day, etc.\n3. Subtract 1 from day to get yesterday's date. (If day is 1, then decrement month, etc., but the function should handle that)\n4. Call utilities_1 with year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0 to get lowerbound.\n5. Call utilities_1 with hour=23, minute=59, second=59 for upperbound.\n6. Then call reminder_3 with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound.\n\nBut since the assistant can only make one tool call per turn, but the user's question is a single turn, how can this be handled?\n\nWait, the problem says \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So the assistant can call multiple functions in a single response. However, each function call is a separate tool_call. So in this case, the assistant would need to make multiple function calls to get the necessary data.\n\nBut how to do that. Let's outline:\n\nFirst, call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n\nThen, use utilities_7 to convert that timestamp into date components.\n\nThen, adjust the day to yesterday.\n\nThen, use utilities_1 to create the lower and upper timestamps.\n\nThen, use reminder_3 with those timestamps.\n\nBut in the tool calls, each step is a separate function call. However, the assistant can chain these function calls in the same response.\n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should output the necessary tool calls in the XML tags. However, each tool_call is a single function call. Therefore, the assistant needs to plan the steps and generate the necessary sequence of function calls.\n\nBut in the current setup, the assistant can't execute code step by step. Instead, it has to generate the function calls in one go, which the system will process. Therefore, the assistant must determine all necessary function calls in advance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp by -1 day. Let's see:\n\nUtilities_5 allows shifting a timestamp by deltas. So if I take the current timestamp, and shift it by days=-1, that would subtract 24 hours. But this gives a timestamp that is 24 hours ago. However, this doesn't account for the entire day. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, then 24 hours ago is yesterday at 3 PM. So setting lower and upper bounds to cover the entire day would require more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the current timestamp, subtract one day and 12 hours to get a lower bound, and then another calculation. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can get the current timestamp, then shift it by -1 day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago. Then, use the start of that day. Wait, but how to get the start of the day.
