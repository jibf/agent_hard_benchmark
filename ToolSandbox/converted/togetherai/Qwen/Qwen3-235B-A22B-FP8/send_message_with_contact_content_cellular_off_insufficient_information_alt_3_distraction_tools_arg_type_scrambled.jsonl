Let me see what tools I have available.\n\nLooking at the functions provided, there's send_message_with_phone_number which requires a phone number and content. To use that, I need Fredrik's phone number. But the user didn't provide it. \n\nI should check if there's a way to get his contact info. The other functions are about cellular service, location, wifi status, and setting those. None of those help with retrieving contact details. \n\nSince I don't have access to Fredrik's phone number, I can't use the send_message function. The user might need to provide the number first. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to know his number, but that's not feasible. \n\nI should respond by asking the user for Fredrik Thordendal's phone number so I can send the message. Without that, I can't proceed. Let me make sure there's no other function that can help here. Nope, the other functions don't handle contacts or messaging without the number. \n\nSo the correct step is to prompt the user to provide the phone number.

Since the user can't provide the phone number, I should acknowledge their apology and maybe suggest alternative ways to reach him. The tools available include sending a message via phone number, checking cellular or wifi status, but without the number, those functions aren't helpful here.\n\nSo, the response should be friendly, accept the apology, and perhaps suggest other methods like social media or official channels. No function calls are needed here because there's no actionable task left to perform with the provided tools. Just a helpful reply to the user's situation.\n</think>\n\nNo problem at all!

Maybe they need help figuring out which social media platforms he uses. Let me check if any of the available functions can help here.

But since they don't have the phone number, sending a message isn't possible. \n\nWait, the user is now considering social media.
