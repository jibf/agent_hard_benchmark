Let me see what tools I have available. There's the send_message_with_phone_number function, which requires a phone number and content. But wait, do I have Fredrik's phone number? The user didn't provide it. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's another way. The other functions are about cellular service, location service, and wifi status. Those don't seem relevant here. Oh, right, there's also set_cellular_service_status and set_wifi_status, but those are for turning services on or off. The user isn't asking to send a message via phone; they might be expecting an email or another method, but the tools don't include email. Wait, maybe the user expects me to use the send_message_with_phone_number function, but without the phone number, I can't. Should I ask for the phone number? The initial instruction says not to assume values, so I should clarify. But the user's message doesn't mention a phone number, so maybe they expect a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps they want to check if the artist has a public contact method. But according to the tools provided, the only way to send a message is via phone number. Since the user didn't provide the number, I can't proceed. I need to inform them that I can't send the message without the phone number. Alternatively, maybe there's a function I'm missing, but looking at the tools, no. So the correct response is to state that I can't send the message because the phone number isn't provided. Wait, but the function send_message_with_phone_number is available, but without the parameters, I can't use it. So the answer should be that I can't perform the action as the required parameters are missing. The user needs to provide the phone number. But how to phrase that. The assistant should respond that it can't send the message without the phone number. So the final answer is to inform the user that the phone number is needed to send the message.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to Fredrik Thordendal's contact information or a way to reach him directly.
