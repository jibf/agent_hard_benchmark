Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, \"todo\" probably refers to reminders or tasks they have set. The user wants to know their tasks from yesterday. Since the available functions include searching for reminders, I should use the search_reminder function.\n\nNow, to find reminders from yesterday, I need to determine the timestamp range for yesterday. That means calculating the lower and upper bounds of the creation timestamp. But wait, should I check the creation timestamp or the reminder timestamp? The user might be referring to when the reminder was created or when it was supposed to be triggered. Since \"yesterday\" is relative to the current date, maybe the reminder's creation date is what's important here. But the question is a bit ambiguous. However, the user might mean the reminders that were due yesterday. Hmm.\n\nWait, the functions have both creation_timestamp and reminder_timestamp. The user might be referring to either. But without more info, maybe I should assume the reminder time. Alternatively, maybe both? But I need to get the user's intent. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, but the user's query is \"todo yesterday\" â€“ probably tasks they had to do yesterday. So the reminder_timestamp should be yesterday's time frame.\n\nSo I need to find all reminders where the reminder_timestamp is between the start and end of yesterday. To get those timestamps, I need to calculate the POSIX timestamps for midnight yesterday and midnight today. But how to get that?\n\nI can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to convert current time to a datetime, subtract a day, then get the lower and upper bounds. Wait, but I need the current time first. Alternatively, maybe use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current time, subtract a day, then convert that date to timestamps for lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut since I don't have the current timestamp, I might need to get it. Wait, but how? The functions don't include getting the current time. Oh, right, the assistant might need to use the functions provided. So perhaps first, I need to get the current timestamp. Wait, but how? The functions don't have a get_current_timestamp function. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, but the user might have to provide that. But they didn't. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can assume that the current time is known, but according to the tools, there's no function to get the current time. Therefore, maybe I need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a guessed current timestamp? Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function once it has a reference timestamp. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the current timestamp, maybe the user's question is missing some info. Wait, but the user might expect the system to know the current time. However, since the tools don't include a function to get the current time, the assistant can't directly retrieve it. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user for clarification. But the user isn't in a conversation; the assistant needs to make a function call.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The functions available include converting datetime info to a timestamp, shifting a timestamp, etc. So the assistant can't get the current time unless the user provides it. But in this case, the user hasn't provided any timestamps. Therefore, perhaps the assistant can't proceed without making an assumption. But according to the instructions, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. So maybe the correct approach is to first determine the current timestamp by using another method. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can infer that to get yesterday's reminders, it needs to find the reminder_timestamp between the start and end of the previous day. To calculate those timestamps, the assistant needs to get the current date, subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then compute the start (midnight) and end (next midnight) of that day. But without knowing the current timestamp, how?\n\nThis is a problem. The assistant can't proceed without knowing the current timestamp. However, in the absence of a function to get the current time, maybe the assistant should inform the user that it can't determine the current time. But according to the tools provided, there's no function to get the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant can't compute yesterday's timestamps. Wait, but maybe the user expects that the system has access to the current time. Maybe the assistant should proceed under the assumption that it can get the current timestamp via some means not specified here. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp, but since the current timestamp isn't provided, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can call the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp as an argument. But how would it know the current timestamp without a function to get it? This seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's question is ambiguous in terms of which timestamp to use (creation vs reminder). The assistant should ask for clarification. However, according to the problem statement, the assistant should call one or more functions to assist with the query. If the user request is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification. But the instructions say \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nSo, given that the user's query doesn't specify whether they want reminders created yesterday or due yesterday, and since the assistant can't determine the current timestamp without additional info, the correct approach is to ask for clarification. However, in the context of the tools, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the reminder_timestamp and calculate the lower and upper bounds for yesterday's day. But since the assistant doesn't know the current timestamp, it can't compute that. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that it needs the current timestamp to proceed. However, the user might not know how to provide that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the system's current time, but according to the rules, it can't assume that. Therefore, the correct response is to ask the user for clarification, such as which timestamp to use (creation or reminder) and the current timestamp. But in the context of the user's question, that might not be practical. However, according to the problem statement, if the request is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user's query is \"What's my todo yesterday?\" Maybe the assistant can proceed by searching for reminders with a reminder_timestamp in the previous day's range. To do that, it needs to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps. To do that, the assistant needs to know the current timestamp. Since it can't get that via a function, perhaps the assistant must ask the user to provide the current timestamp. But that's not user-friendly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date minus one day. But again, without knowing the current date, this isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without making assumptions. Therefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the request is ambiguous and needs clarification. However, given the tools, perhaps the assistant can make a function call to search_reminder with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to approximate yesterday's range. But without knowing the current time, this is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a given timestamp to find out the current date. But again, without a timestamp to start with, this isn't possible. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. But according to the problem statement, the assistant is supposed to call functions. So perhaps the assistant should make a function call that indicates the need for the current time, but there's no such function. Therefore, the assistant should respond that the current time is needed. However, the user might not be able to provide that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can proceed by using a placeholder, but according to the function definitions, all parameters must be filled. Therefore, the assistant might not be able to proceed. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a guessed timestamp, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, the assistant can't proceed without more information, so the correct approach is to ask the user to clarify which timestamp (creation or reminder) they're referring to and provide the current timestamp. However, since this is a text-based response, the assistant should output a tool call if possible. But given the ambiguity, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. Therefore, the correct response is to not make a tool call and instead ask for clarification. However, the instructions say that if the user request is ambiguous, the assistant should ask for clarification. But the assistant is supposed to return tool calls if applicable. So perhaps the assistant should first call a function to get the current timestamp, but there's no such function. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed and must ask for clarification.\n\nWait, but the user's question might be answerable by searching for reminders with a reminder_timestamp in the past day. But the user said \"yesterday,\" which is a specific day, not the past 24 hours. So the assistant needs to find the start and end of yesterday. Without knowing the current time, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user to clarify the current date or provide the necessary timestamps. However, in the absence of such information, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the correct action is to respond that the request is ambiguous and needs more info, such as the current date or which timestamp to search on.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant must use the provided tools. So perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to convert the current date minus one day to get the lower bound, but again, without knowing the current", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
