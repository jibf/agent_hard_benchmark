Let me check the available functions.\n\nThe tools provided are add_contact, modify_contact, and remove_contact. The remove_contact function requires a person_id. But the user provided a phone number. \n\nHmm, the problem is that the remove_contact function needs a person_id, not a phone number. So I can't directly use the phone number to delete the contact. I need to find the person_id associated with that phone number. \n\nWait, but the current tools don't have a search or lookup function. The user hasn't provided a way to find the person_id by phone number. So maybe the system expects that the user knows the person_id. \n\nIn this case, the user doesn't have the person_id. The functions available don't allow searching by phone number. So I should inform the user that I can't perform the removal because I don't have the necessary person_id. Alternatively, maybe the modify_contact function could be used if we could find the person_id, but without a search function, that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to tell the user that the contact can't be removed without the person_id. They might need to provide more information or check if there's another way to identify the contact.\n</think>\n\nThe provided tools require a `person_id` to remove a contact, but the request only includes a phone number.

They don't have the person_id. Hmm, the tools available don't include a search function. So I can't look up the person_id based on the phone number. The user might not know the person_id, which is a problem. How do they expect to delete the contact without it? Maybe they think there's a way to search, but according to the tools provided, there isn't. I should inform them that without the person_id, I can't perform the removal. I need to ask if they have any other details that could help, but since the tools don't support searching, maybe they need to provide the person_id directly. Alternatively, maybe they can check their contacts list to find the ID. I should explain that the current functionality requires the person_id and suggest they try to locate it. If they still can't find it, they might need to add the contact again to get a new ID, but that might not be helpful. Wait, adding a contact with the same info would create a new entry. Not sure. The main point is that without the person_id, the removal isn't possible. So I need to make that clear and ask for the person_id again.\n</think>\n\nThe system currently requires a `person_id` to remove a contact, and there's no available function to search for a contact by phone number.
