Let me check the available tools. There's a function called remove_contact that takes a person_id as a parameter. The person_id is a unique identifier for the person. But the user provided a phone number instead of a person_id.\n\nHmm, the function requires the person_id, but the user doesn't have that. They only have the phone number. I can't directly use the phone number as the person_id unless the system uses phone numbers as unique IDs, which isn't specified here. The tool's description says person_id is a string format unique identifier, so maybe it's a UUID or some other string. Without knowing the actual person_id, I can't call the function. \n\nWait, the user might not know the person_id and is referring to the contact by phone number. Since the function can't take a phone number, there's a problem here. The assistant should ask for clarification or more information. But according to the instructions, if the request is ambiguous, I should ask for clarification. However, the user might expect that the system can look up the person_id by phone number. \n\nBut the tools provided don't include a function to search for a contact by phone number. The only function available is remove_contact, which needs the person_id. Therefore, the assistant can't perform the removal without the person_id. The correct response would be to inform the user that the person_id is needed. But since the user might not have that, maybe there's an assumption that the phone number is the person_id. However, the function's parameters don't specify that, so that's an unsafe assumption. \n\nIn this case, the safest approach is to respond that the person_id is required and ask the user to provide it. Since the user mentioned the phone number, maybe they can look it up elsewhere. Alternatively, if the system allows, the assistant might need to explain that it can't proceed without the person_id. Therefore, the correct tool call isn't possible here, and the assistant should prompt the user for the necessary information.\n</think>\n\nThe function `remove_contact` requires a `person_id` as a unique identifier to delete a contact. Since the provided information only includes a phone number (+12453344098) and not the `person_id`, I cannot directly execute the removal.

Maybe suggest they check if there's another way to get the person_id or if they can provide more details. But stick to the tools given.
