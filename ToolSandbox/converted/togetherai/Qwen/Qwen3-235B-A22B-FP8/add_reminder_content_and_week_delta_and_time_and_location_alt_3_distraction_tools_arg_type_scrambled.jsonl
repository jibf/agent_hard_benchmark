buy chocolate milk tomorrow at 5 PM at Whole Foods on Stevens Creek. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the timestamp for tomorrow at 5 PM. Since the current date isn't given, I should use the get_current_timestamp function to get the current time. Then, add one day (which is 24*60*60 seconds) to get tomorrow's date. Wait, but maybe the user wants exactly 5 PM regardless of the current time. So, perhaps I should calculate the date for tomorrow at 17:00.\n\nBut how to convert that into a POSIX timestamp. Oh right, there's the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But to use that, I need the year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Let me think. Let's get the current timestamp first, then parse it into date-time info to find tomorrow's date.\n\nWait, maybe the user's current location is needed for time zones? But the user mentioned Whole Foods on Stevens Creek, which is probably in a specific time zone. However, the functions available don't mention time zones. Hmm. This could complicate things. If the user is in a different time zone, adding 24 hours might not work. But since the functions don't handle time zones, perhaps the system assumes UTC or the user's local time. The problem says to not make assumptions, so maybe I should proceed with the current timestamp and add one day to get tomorrow's date, then set the hour to 17:00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the reminder to be set for tomorrow at 5 PM regardless of the current time. So first, get the current timestamp, convert it to datetime info, add one day to the day (and possibly month or year if it's the last day of the month), then set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0. Then convert that datetime info back to a timestamp.\n\nWait, but how to handle adding a day. Let's see. Suppose today is 2023-10-05. Then tomorrow is 2023-10-06. So, using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp would give me the current date. Then increment the day by 1. Then use datetime_info_to_timestamp to get the timestamp for tomorrow at 00:00. Then add 17*60*60 seconds to get 5 PM.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp with get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert that to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Increment day by 1 (if month/year changes, handle that automatically? Or does the function take care of it?)\n4. Set hour to 17, minute to 0, second to 0.\n5. Convert back to a timestamp.\n\nYes, that seems right. So first, call get_current_timestamp. Then, use that to get the datetime info. Then adjust the date to tomorrow and set the time to 5 PM. Then convert that to a timestamp.\n\nThen, I need to search for the location \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\" using the search_location_around_lat_lon function. The parameters are \"location\": \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". But since latitude and longitude are optional, it'll search around the current location. Wait, but the user didn't provide coordinates, so the function will use current location. But the user might not have provided permission for that. However, the function defaults to current lat/lon if not provided. So I can call search_location_around_lat_lon with location as \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\".\n\nWait, the function requires \"location\" as a required parameter, which is provided. The lat and lon are optional. So the tool call would be to search_location_around_lat_lon with the location set to \"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\". The result should give the lat and lon of that Whole Foods. Then, use those coordinates in the add_reminder function.\n\nBut since the user wants to add a reminder with content \"buy chocolate milk\" and the location, the add_reminder function needs the content, reminder_timestamp, and optionally lat and lon.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp to calculate reminder time.\n2. Convert to datetime info, add one day, set time to 5 PM, convert back to timestamp.\n3. Search for Whole Foods on Stevens Creek to get lat and lon.\n4. Add reminder with content, calculated timestamp, and lat/lon from step 3.\n\nBut the problem is that the functions need to be called in sequence. However, in the current setup, I can only call one function per turn. Wait, the user's message is a single query, so I need to handle all necessary steps in one go, but the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. However, the user is asking to add a reminder, which requires both the timestamp and location. Therefore, the assistant might need to chain these calls. But since the assistant can't do that in one step, maybe it should first calculate the timestamp and then search for the location, then add the reminder. But the user's input requires multiple steps. However, the assistant is supposed to output the necessary tool calls. Wait, but according to the instructions, for each turn, the assistant can call one or more functions. Wait, the user message is the first turn, so the assistant needs to generate the appropriate tool calls.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to add a reminder. To do that, the assistant needs to:\n\n- Determine the reminder timestamp (tomorrow at 5 PM)\n- Find the location (Whole Foods on Stevens Creek) to get lat and lon\n- Call add_reminder with content, reminder_timestamp, and lat/lon\n\nBut each of these steps requires separate function calls. However, the assistant can't perform multiple tool calls in a single response. Wait, no, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. Let me check the example in the tools section. The example shows one tool call per response. So perhaps the assistant should proceed step by step. However, since the user is asking for a single action (adding a reminder), the assistant might need to handle all the steps internally and make multiple function calls in the same response.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So multiple tool calls can be made in the same response. So the assistant can first call get_current_timestamp to get the current time, then use that to compute tomorrow at 5 PM, then call search_location_around_lat_lon for the location, then use the results from both to call add_reminder.\n\nBut how to structure that. Let's see. The assistant would first need to get the current timestamp. Then, compute tomorrow's date at 5 PM. Then, get the location's coordinates. Then, add the reminder.\n\nBut since the functions are called in sequence, the assistant would need to first call get_current_timestamp. Then, once that's done, the next step would be to process the datetime info, then call search_location_around_lat_lon, and finally call add_reminder. However, in the initial response, the assistant can only call one function. Wait, but the user's query is a single input, so the assistant needs to generate all necessary tool calls in the correct order. But perhaps the assistant can chain the function calls in a single response. For example:\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp, then compute the reminder timestamp. Then, search for the location. Then, add the reminder with the obtained lat and lon.\n\nBut how to represent that in the tool calls. Since the functions are separate, the assistant needs to first call get_current_timestamp. Once that's done, then use the result to compute the reminder timestamp. Then, call search_location_around_lat_lon. Then, once the location is found, call add_reminder.\n\nBut in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. Therefore, in the first step, the assistant would call get_current_timestamp. Then, the system would process that, and the assistant would proceed to the next step. However, the user's original query is a single message, so the assistant's first response should be the first tool call, and subsequent steps would be based on the results of previous calls.\n\nBut given that, in this scenario, the assistant needs to generate all necessary tool calls in sequence. However, the assistant can only output one tool call per response. Therefore, the initial response would be to get the current timestamp. Then, the next step would involve processing that timestamp, then searching for the location, then adding the reminder.\n\nBut since the user's original message is a single query, the assistant's first response should be to call get_current_timestamp. Then, after receiving the current timestamp, the next function call would be to process the datetime info to get tomorrow's 5 PM. Wait, but there's no function for that. The datetime_info_to_timestamp function can be used if we have the components. So after getting the current timestamp, the assistant would need to convert it to datetime info, add one day, set the hour to 17, minute 0, second 0, then convert back to a timestamp.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() → returns current_ts.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=current_ts) → returns current_dt.\n3. Increment day by 1, check if month/year rolls over, then set hour=17, minute=0, second=0 → new_dt.\n4. Call datetime_info_to_timestamp with new_dt → reminder_ts.\n5. Call search_location_around_lat_lon(location=\"Whole Foods on Stevens Creek\") → returns lat, lon.\n", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
