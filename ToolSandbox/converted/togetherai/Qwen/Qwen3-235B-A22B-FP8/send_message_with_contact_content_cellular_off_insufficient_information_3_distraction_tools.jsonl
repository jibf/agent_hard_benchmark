There's a send_message_with_phone_number function that requires a phone number and content. The problem is, the user didn't provide Fredrik's phone number. Without the phone number, I can't use the function. \n\nWait, maybe I can find his phone number through another function? Let me check the other tools. The other functions are get_cellular_service_status, get_location_service_status, get_wifi_status, set_cellular_service_status, and set_wifi_status. None of these functions can retrieve a phone number. \n\nSo I can't send the message without the phone number. The user might expect me to know Fredrik's number, but I don't have access to that information. The user also said to resolve any issue alone, but there's no way to get the phone number on my own. \n\nIn this case, I should inform the user that I can't send the message without the phone number. But wait, the user instructed me to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. However, the user also said \"Resolve any issue alone,\" which might mean they don't want me to ask for help. \n\nHmm, conflicting instructions. The user wants me to resolve issues alone but also not to make assumptions. Since the phone number is missing, I can't proceed. Maybe the user expects me to point out the missing information even though they said to resolve alone. Alternatively, maybe they want me to use another function to get the number, but there's no such function available. \n\nTherefore, the correct action is to respond that the phone number is needed to send the message, even though the user said to resolve alone. Because without the number, it's impossible, and the user might have intended to provide it but forgot. However, the user's instruction says to ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous. Since the missing phone number makes the request unexecutable, I should clarify by pointing out the missing information. \n\nWait, but the user's example shows that if the user says \"Send a message to John Doe\", the assistant should ask for the phone number. In this case, the user didn't provide the number, so I need to ask for it. However, the user's instruction here says to resolve any issue alone, but there's no way to resolve the missing number alone. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the phone number is required to send the message.\n</think>\n\nI need Fredrik Thordendal's phone number to send the message.
