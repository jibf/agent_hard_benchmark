Let me check the available functions. There's a remove_contact function that requires a person_id. But the user provided a phone number, not a person_id. Hmm, the functions don't have a way to search by phone number. Maybe the user doesn't know the person_id. I need to ask them to confirm if they have the correct person_id or if they need help finding it. Since the system can't look up contacts by phone number directly, I can't proceed without the person_id. I should inform the user about this and request the necessary information.\n</think>\n\nTo remove a contact, I need the unique identifier (person_id) of the contact entry. Since multiple entries can have the same phone number, I cannot directly remove the contact using just the phone number. Could you provide the `person_id` of the contact you'd like to remove?

Since the system requires a person_id to delete a contact, I need to figure out how to help them find it.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's another function that can list contacts. But looking at the provided tools, there's no function like \"get_contacts\" or \"search_contact\" that allows querying by phone number. The available functions are add, modify, remove, and others unrelated to contacts. \n\nWait, maybe the user can be guided to look up the contact through their phone's contact list, but that's outside the provided functions. Since the tools don't include a search function, I can't programmatically retrieve the person_id here. \n\nSo the best approach is to inform the user that without the person_id, the removal can't proceed via the current tools. I should suggest that if they have access to the contact list (maybe through another interface), they should find the ID there. Alternatively, if they can provide more details, maybe I can help them find the ID indirectly, but again, without a search function, that's not possible here.\n\nI need to make sure the user understands that the person_id is necessary and offer assistance in finding it if possible. Since the tools don't support searching by phone number, the user might need to use another method outside of the current system.\n</think>\n\nWithout a `person_id`, I cannot directly remove the contact using the available tools. The system requires a unique identifier to delete a contact entry. If you can provide additional details (e.g., name, relationship, or any other identifying information), I might help you locate the correct `person_id` first. Otherwise, you may need to manually locate and delete the contact through your device's contact manager.
