So I should use the search_reminder function. But what parameters are needed? Since they didn't specify any details like content, location, or exact time, I should focus on the reminder timestamp. Upcoming probably means reminders that are set to trigger after the current time.\n\nSo the key is to set a lower bound for the reminder_timestamp. The current time's timestamp would be the lower bound. That way, any reminders scheduled from now onwards will be included. The user didn't mention a specific upper bound, so maybe leave that out unless needed.\n\nWait, how do I get the current timestamp? The tools have datetime_info_to_timestamp, but that requires date and time info. Alternatively, maybe the system can get the current timestamp, but since the user hasn't provided specific time details, perhaps I can use a placeholder or assume the current time. But since the user might be asking in real-time, I need to calculate the current timestamp.\n\nWait, but the assistant can't get the current time directly. So maybe I need to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time. But how do I get the current date and time? The user hasn't provided it. Hmm, maybe the assistant should prompt the user for the current time or use a function that can generate the current timestamp. But looking at the tools, there's no function to get the current timestamp directly. The datetime_info_to_timestamp requires explicit parameters. Since the user hasn't provided the current date and time, I can't use that. \n\nWait, maybe the system can infer that the user is asking for reminders after the current time, and the assistant can use the search_reminder function with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the current timestamp. But how to get the current timestamp? Since the tools don't include a way to get the current time without user input, perhaps the assistant should proceed under the assumption that the user is asking for reminders with a reminder_timestamp greater than now. However, without knowing the exact current timestamp, the assistant can't set that lower bound. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expected to provide the current time or the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time parameters. But since the user hasn't provided that information, perhaps the assistant should ask for it. However, the user's question is \"What's my upcoming reminder,\" which is a common query, and the assistant should handle it by using the current timestamp as the lower bound. \n\nBut how to get the current timestamp? Since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, the assistant might need to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date and time. However, without the user providing that data, it's impossible. Therefore, maybe the assistant should proceed by using the search_reminder function with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to 0, which would return all reminders, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant can't determine the current timestamp and must ask the user for clarification. \n\nWait, but the user might be in the process of providing information. Let me check the tools again. The tools available include datetime_info_to_timestamp, which requires year, month, day, hour, minute, second. Since the user hasn't provided these, the assistant can't compute the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed without knowing the current time. However, in a real-world scenario, the system might have access to the current time. But given the tools provided, the assistant must use the functions as per the user's input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed by using the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound as a parameter that needs to be filled. Since the user's question is about upcoming reminders, the lower bound should be the current timestamp. But since the assistant doesn't have access to the current timestamp, perhaps the user is expected to provide it. However, the user hasn't, so the assistant might need to ask for it. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided any information about the current time. So perhaps the assistant should respond by asking the user to provide the current date and time to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use a default value or make an assumption, but the instructions say not to assume values. Therefore, the correct approach is to call the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the current timestamp, which requires the current timestamp. But since that's not available, the assistant must first call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date and time parameters, which the user hasn't provided. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. Maybe the problem is that the assistant is supposed to generate a function call that would handle the upcoming reminders, even if it requires parameters that the user hasn't provided yet. In that case, the assistant should call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the current timestamp, which would require knowing the current timestamp. But since the user hasn't provided the current date and time, the assistant can't compute the timestamp. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user for the current date and time. \n\nHowever, the user's question is straightforward, and in a real application, the system would know the current time. Since the assistant can't know it without the user's input, the correct approach is to call search_reminder with the lower bound for the reminder timestamp as the current timestamp, which requires the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant must first get the current timestamp. To do that, the assistant would need to use datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date and time. But since the user hasn't provided that, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nThis suggests that the assistant needs to ask the user for the current date and time. However, the user might not know how to provide it. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming that the upcoming reminders are those with reminder_timestamp_upperbound set to a certain value, but that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the search_reminder function with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound as 0 and upperbound as some future time. But that's not efficient. \n\nWait, the user's question is \"What's my upcoming reminder?\" which implies that they want all reminders scheduled after the current time. Therefore, the correct parameters for search_reminder would be reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to the current timestamp. Since the assistant can't compute the current timestamp without knowing the current date and time, the assistant must first get that information. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should first call the datetime_info_to_timestamp function, but to do that, they need the user to provide the current date and time. However, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user for the current date and time. But the problem is that the user might not provide that in the next step. \n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should call the necessary functions. If the assistant can't proceed without certain parameters, it should ask the user for clarification. However, in this case, the assistant needs to generate a function call. Since the assistant can't assume the current timestamp, perhaps the correct approach is to call search_reminder with reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to a placeholder, but that's not allowed. \n\nWait, the instructions say, \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\" So the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. Therefore, the assistant needs to determine that the user's request requires knowing the current timestamp to find upcoming reminders, which requires knowing the current date and time. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user to provide the current date and time. \n\nBut the assistant can't ask questions in natural language. Instead, it must use function calls. Wait, no, the assistant's response should be in function calls if possible. However, if the parameters are missing, the assistant must ask for clarification. \n\nWait, the initial problem is that the user says \"upcoming reminder,\" which implies the assistant needs to find reminders where the reminder timestamp is in the future. To do that, the assistant needs to set reminder_timestamp_lowerbound to the current timestamp. But since the current timestamp is not provided, the assistant can't compute it. Therefore, the assistant must call the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to get the current timestamp. But to do that, the assistant needs the current date and time parameters. \n\nSo, the assistant would first call datetime_info_to_timestamp with the current date and time. But since the user hasn't provided those, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking the user for the current date and time. However, according to the problem setup, the assistant should respond with function calls if possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the search_reminder function with the reminder_timestamp_lowerbound set to a placeholder, but that's not allowed. The correct approach is to first get the current timestamp. Therefore, the assistant should first call datetime_info_to_timestamp, but the parameters are missing. \n\nIn this case, the assistant must ask the user for the current date and time. However, the way to do that is to generate a request for the user to provide that information. But according to the instructions, the assistant should return function calls. Since the user hasn't provided the current date and time, the assistant can't call datetime_info_to_timestamp. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should respond by indicating that it needs the current date and time to proceed. However, the problem is that the assistant is supposed to use the tools provided. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can't proceed and must ask the user for clarification. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking the user to provide the current date and time. However, in the context of the tool calls, the assistant should return a function call if possible.", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
