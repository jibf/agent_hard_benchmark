First, I need to find the contact associated with that number. The previous step used the search_contacts function with the phone number, and it returned a contact with person_id '9e137f06-916a-5310-8174-cf0b7e9f7054'. \n\nNow, to remove this contact, I should check if there's a function available for deletion. However, looking at the provided tools, there's no delete_contact function listed. The available functions are add_contact, modify_contact, and search_contacts. \n\nSince there's no delete function, the next logical step is to inform the user that the contact can't be removed because the necessary tool isn't available. Alternatively, maybe the modify_contact function can be used to update the contact's information, but that doesn't actually remove it. \n\nThe user's request is to remove the contact, which implies deletion. Without a delete function, I can't perform that action. Therefore, I should respond that the contact can't be removed with the current tools and suggest that the user might need to use a different method or check if there's another way to manage their contacts.\n</think>\n\nThe contact with phone number +12453344098 cannot be removed because there is no available function to delete contacts in the provided tools.
