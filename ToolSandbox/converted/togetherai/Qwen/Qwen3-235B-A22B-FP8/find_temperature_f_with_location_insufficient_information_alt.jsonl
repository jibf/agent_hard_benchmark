So first, I need to figure out the current temperature there. Since I don't have real-time data, I should use the available functions. Wait, the tools provided are search_location_around_lat_lon and unit_conversion. \n\nHmm, the search_location_around_lat_lon function can look up locations, but does it provide weather information? The description mentions details like name, address, category, but not weather. The user wants the current temp, which isn't covered by that function. The unit_conversion function is for converting units, like Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n\nWait, maybe the user expects me to first get the temperature in Celsius using another method, then convert it. But since I don't have a weather API, maybe the assistant should first check if the location search can provide the temp. But according to the function's description, it doesn't include temperature. So the functions available aren't sufficient to answer the query. \n\nBut the user might not know that. So I should explain that I can't retrieve real-time weather data but can convert units if they provide a temperature. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the location search to find the Grand Canyon's current temperature. Let me check the function parameters again. The search_location_around_lat_lon function's parameters are location, latitude, longitude. The results include info like name, address, category, etc., but no mention of weather. So using this function won't get the temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that I can't access real-time weather data but can help convert units if they have a specific temperature value they want to convert. However, the user's message says \"I can't read Celsius,\" so maybe they want the temperature in Fahrenheit. But without the actual Celsius value, I can't perform the conversion. \n\nSo the assistant should respond that they can't retrieve the current temperature but can convert it if the user provides a value. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the search_location function to see if there's any weather-related info, but according to the function's description, there isn't. \n\nIn this case, the best tool to use is unit_conversion, but the user hasn't provided a temperature value. So the assistant needs to ask for clarification. Wait, the user's query is ambiguous because they want the current temperature but don't specify a source. The assistant should ask for the Celsius temperature they want to convert or explain the lack of data. Since the tools don't include a weather API, the assistant can't get the current temp. Therefore, the assistant should respond that they can't access real-time data but can convert if given a value. However, the user might have expected the assistant to find the current temperature through the location search. Since that's not possible, the assistant should clarify.\n</think>\n\nThe functions provided don't include a way to retrieve current weather information like temperature. However, if you have a specific temperature value in Celsius that you'd like converted to Fahrenheit, I can help with that using the unit conversion tool.
