reminder I created yesterday?\" Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which function to use. The user is asking about reminders they created, so the relevant functions are related to reminders. Looking at the available tools, there's a function called search_reminder. The description says it searches for reminders based on various criteria, including creation timestamp ranges.\n\nThe user mentioned \"yesterday.\" To find reminders created yesterday, I need to calculate the timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. But how do I get the current timestamp to determine what yesterday was? There's a get_current_timestamp function that can provide the current time. Once I have the current timestamp, I can subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday and then calculate the upper bound as the start of today.\n\nWait, but the search_reminder function allows specifying creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. So, if I can get the current timestamp, shift it back by 24 hours, and set that as the lower bound, and then set the upper bound as the current timestamp minus 24 hours plus 24 hours (which is the start of today), but maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, shift_timestamp function can adjust a timestamp by days, hours, etc. But first, I need the current timestamp.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n2. Subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) from the current timestamp to get the start of yesterday.\n3. Subtract 0 seconds from the current timestamp to get the start of today (since yesterday ends at the start of today).\n4. Use these two timestamps as the lower and upper bounds in the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound parameters for the search_reminder function.\n\nBut since the assistant can't perform calculations itself, it needs to use the available functions. The get_current_timestamp will give the current time. Then, to find the lower bound (start of yesterday), subtract 24 hours. Wait, the shift_timestamp function can take a timestamp and shift it by days, hours, etc. So:\n\n- Get current timestamp (call get_current_timestamp).\n- Shift it by -1 days to get the same time yesterday. But the user wants the entire day of yesterday, so maybe set the lower bound to yesterday's midnight and upper bound to today's midnight.\n\nAlternatively, using the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to break down the current timestamp into date components, then subtract one day, and reconstruct the timestamp for midnight of yesterday and today.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Since the user is asking for reminders created yesterday, the creation_timestamp should be between the start of yesterday and the start of today. To get that range, we can use the current timestamp and subtract 24 hours for the lower bound and use the current timestamp as the upper bound. Wait, no, because \"yesterday\" would be from midnight of the day before today to midnight of today. Wait, no. If today is day X, yesterday is day X-1, so from midnight of X-1 to midnight of X. So to get reminders created yesterday, the creation timestamp should be >= start of yesterday (midnight) and < start of today (midnight).\n\nBut how to calculate those timestamps? The assistant can't do that directly; it has to use the functions provided. So perhaps:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp to get the current timestamp (T).\n2. Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on T to get the current date components (year, month, day, etc.).\n3. Then, subtract the time part (hours, minutes, seconds) from T to get midnight today. But how? Alternatively, shift_timestamp with days=-1 to get T-24 hours, but that's not exactly midnight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the easiest way is to get the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (86400 seconds) to get a point 24 hours ago, and set the lower bound as that, and the upper bound as the current timestamp. But that would include reminders created in the last 24 hours, which is not exactly \"yesterday\" if the current time is, say, 3 PM. Yesterday would be from midnight to midnight. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the user might mean \"created within the last 24 hours,\" but the question is phrased as \"yesterday,\" which typically refers to the full day before today. So if today is Monday, yesterday is Sunday. So to get that, the start of yesterday (midnight) would be (current timestamp - (current timestamp's hours * 3600 + current timestamp's minutes * 60 + current timestamp's seconds) - 86400 seconds), and the end would be start of today (midnight today).\n\nBut without the ability to calculate that, maybe the assistant can first get the current timestamp, then use the shift_timestamp function to subtract the appropriate amount. Alternatively, use the timestamp_to_datetime_info to get midnight of today and then subtract one day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the search_reminder function can accept a date range. Since the user is asking for \"yesterday,\" the assistant can:\n\n- Get the current timestamp (T).\n- Shift T by -1 day to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago (T-24h).\n- Use that as the lower_bound for creation_timestamp.\n- Use T as the upper_bound.\n\nBut this would include reminders created in the last 24 hours, which might not exactly align with the calendar day of \"yesterday\" if the current time is not midnight. However, given the available functions, this might be the best approximation possible without more complex date manipulation.\n\nBut the user might expect reminders created on the calendar day of yesterday. For example, if today is Tuesday, July 11th, 2023, then yesterday is July 10th, from 00:00 to 23:59:59. To get that, the lower_bound would be the start of July 10th, and upper_bound the start of July 11th.\n\nTo compute those timestamps, the assistant would need to:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).\n3. Subtract (hour*3600 + minute*60 + second) seconds from T to get midnight of today (July 11th 00:00:00).\n4. Subtract 86400 seconds (24h) to get midnight of July 10th (start of yesterday).\n5. Upper bound is midnight of today (July 11th 00:00:00).\n\nBut the assistant can't perform these calculations directly. It needs to use the available functions. So steps would be:\n\n- Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n- Use timestamp_to_datetime_info on T to get the current date and time components.\n- Then, create a new datetime for the same year, month, day, but with hour=0, minute=0, second=0. Then convert that back to a timestamp. But there's no function to do that. Alternatively, use shift_timestamp on T by subtracting the current hours, minutes, and seconds. But how?\n\nWait, there's the shift_timestamp function which can adjust by days, hours, minutes. For example, if current time is 3 PM (15:00), to get midnight, subtract 15 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.\n\nBut the assistant doesn't know the current time's components until it calls get_current_timestamp and then processes it. However, the assistant can't process it without a function. So perhaps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp. Let's say the result is T.\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with T to get the current date and time details, including hour, minute, second.\n3. Then, shift T by -hours, -minutes, -seconds to get midnight of today.\n4. Then shift that by -1 day to get midnight of yesterday.\n5. Then use those two timestamps as lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps and function calls. However, the assistant is supposed to generate the necessary tool calls in sequence. But the user's initial question might require this multi-step process.\n\nBut given that the user is asking for reminders created yesterday, and the assistant's available functions, the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, then calculate the start and end of yesterday, then call search_reminder with those bounds.\n\nHowever, the assistant can't perform these calculations itself; it needs to use the functions. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp to get the current time.\n2. Use timestamp_diff to calculate the difference between current timestamp and a timestamp shifted back by 1 day (using shift_timestamp with days=-1) to get the lower bound (start of yesterday) and upper bound (start of today).\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function twice. For example:\n\n- Lower bound: current timestamp shifted by -1 day.\n- Upper bound: current timestamp.\n\nBut that would include reminders from the last 24 hours, which might not exactly be yesterday (if the current time is 3 PM, then 24 hours ago is yesterday at 3 PM). So if the user wants all of yesterday, regardless of the current time, this approach might not capture the entire day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's system can handle the exact date calculation, and the assistant can just use the shift_timestamp function to find the start of yesterday and today.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to first get the current timestamp, then determine the start of yesterday and start of", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
