Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to use the search_reminder function. The user wants reminders created yesterday. The function allows searching by creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound. \n\nBut wait, what's the exact time frame for \"yesterday\"? I need to calculate the start and end timestamps of yesterday. To do that, I can get the current timestamp, shift it by -1 day to get to yesterday's date, then find the start (midnight) and end (23:59:59) of that day.\n\nWait, but how do I get the current timestamp? The tools provided don't have a function for getting the current time. Hmm, maybe I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a shifted timestamp. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the shift_timestamp function on a known timestamp. Wait, but without knowing the current timestamp, I can't proceed. Wait, perhaps the functions can handle this. Wait, maybe the user expects that the system can figure out the current time. But the tools don't include a function to get the current time. Oh, but the user might have provided a previous message with a timestamp, but in this case, the conversation starts fresh. \n\nWait, the functions don't include a way to get the current time. So how can I determine yesterday's timestamp? Oh, perhaps the user expects that the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function on a reference timestamp. Wait, but without knowing the current timestamp, this is impossible. Wait, but maybe the user's question implies that the assistant should use the current time. Wait, but the tools don't have a function to get the current time. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, looking back at the tools, there's a timestamp_to_datetime_info function which requires a timestamp. So maybe the assistant can't get the current time without the user providing it. But the user hasn't provided any current time information here. So perhaps the assistant needs to ask for clarification. But the user's question is about yesterday, so maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming that the user's system provides the current time. Wait, but in the absence of a function to get the current time, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function on a timestamp obtained from the user. Wait, but the user hasn't provided any timestamp. Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Wait, maybe the user expects that the assistant can use the current time implicitly. But since the tools don't have a function to get the current time, how? \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a timestamp that's passed as a parameter. Wait, but the user hasn't provided any timestamp. So this is a problem. Maybe the user expects that the system can infer the current time, but with the given tools, it's not possible. Therefore, the assistant should ask for the current time. However, the user's question is \"What's the todo item I made yesterday?\" without providing any context. \n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the search_reminder function with creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound set to yesterday's start and end times. But how to calculate those times without knowing the current time. \n\nThis seems like a catch-22. Without knowing the current time, the assistant can't determine yesterday's timestamps. Therefore, the assistant needs to ask the user for the current date or time. However, the user hasn't provided that. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function, but that requires a base timestamp. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by assuming today's date. Wait, but the assistant can't assume the current date. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user that the current date is needed to determine what \"yesterday\" refers to. However, the user might not know that. But according to the tools provided, the assistant can't get the current time. Therefore, the assistant should ask for the current date. But in the given scenario, the user hasn't provided that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can proceed by using the current time as of when the function is called. Wait, but in the context of the function calls, the assistant can't access real-time. Therefore, the assistant must ask for clarification. \n\nWait, but the user's question is straightforward. Maybe the assistant should proceed by using the functions to calculate the time. Wait, but how? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the assistant could get the current timestamp via some implicit means. For example, if the user's system provides it. But according to the tools, there's no function to get the current time. Therefore, the assistant can't proceed. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a timestamp that is passed as a parameter. But since the user hasn't provided any timestamp, this isn't possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct action is to inform the user that the current time is needed to determine \"yesterday,\" and ask for that information. However, the user might not have provided it. \n\nBut in the context of the problem, the assistant is supposed to call functions. So maybe the assistant should proceed by using the shift_timestamp function on a reference timestamp. Wait, but without knowing the starting point, this is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's question implies that the assistant should use the current day's timestamp. Wait, but how? \n\nThis is a problem. Since the tools don't include a way to get the current time, and the user hasn't provided any timestamp, the assistant can't accurately determine yesterday's timestamps. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user for the current date or time. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any context, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the assistant needs the current time to proceed. However, in the given scenario, the assistant must use the functions. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with today's date minus one day. But how does the assistant know today's date? It can't. \n\nTherefore, the assistant must ask the user to provide the current date. But the problem states that the assistant shouldn't make assumptions about values. Therefore, the correct approach is to ask for the current date. \n\nBut in the context of the tool calls, the assistant can't ask the user for more information. Wait, no, the assistant can respond with a request for clarification. The initial instructions say: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous.\"\n\nTherefore, since the user's request is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date, which isn't provided, the assistant should ask for clarification. \n\nBut wait, the user might expect that the assistant can use the current date. However, since the tools don't have a function to get the current date, the assistant can't. Therefore, the assistant must ask for the current date. \n\nSo the assistant should respond by asking the user for the current date and time to determine what \"yesterday\" refers to. But according to the problem's instructions, the assistant should either call a function or ask for clarification. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is to ask the user for the current date and time. However, the example might expect that the assistant uses the functions to calculate. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the search_reminder function with creation_timestamp_lowerbound as the start of yesterday and upperbound as the end of yesterday. But to compute those timestamps, the assistant needs to know the current time. \n\nSince the assistant can't get the current time, the functions can't be properly called. Therefore, the assistant should ask for clarification. \n\nThus, the assistant should respond by asking the user for the current date and time so that \"yesterday\" can be determined. However, in the context of the given tools, the assistant can't obtain the current time. Therefore, the assistant must ask the user for that information.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve the todo items you made yesterday, I need to determine the timestamps for the start and end of yesterday.
