they made yesterday. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what functions are available. The reminder_3 function allows searching for reminders based on various criteria. Since the user is asking about a todo item, which is likely a reminder, that's the function to use.\n\nThe user mentioned \"yesterday.\" So I need to determine the timestamp range for yesterday. To do that, I can use the utilities_2 function to get the current timestamp. Then, subtract one day to get yesterday's date. But wait, maybe I should calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps.\n\nWait, the utilities_5 function can shift a timestamp by days. So if I get the current timestamp with utilities_2, then subtract a day by using utilities_5 with days=-1. Then, the start of yesterday would be that timestamp minus 24 hours, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the start (midnight) of yesterday and the start of today. That way, the range would cover all of yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might have created the reminder at any time during yesterday, I can set the creation_timestamp_upperbound to the start of today and creation_timestamp_lowerbound to the start of yesterday. \n\nBut how to get those timestamps? Let me think. Let's first get the current timestamp using utilities_2. Then, subtract a day to get yesterday's date. Then, find the midnight time for yesterday and today. Wait, but how do I get the midnight of a specific day? Maybe using utilities_7 to convert the current timestamp to date time info, then subtract a day, set hours, minutes, seconds to zero. Hmm, that might be complicated. Alternatively, using utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp by -1 day, then set the lower bound to that shifted timestamp, and upper bound to the shifted timestamp plus 24 hours. Wait, no, that would cover the same day. Or perhaps use the current timestamp, subtract a day to get a point in yesterday, then create a range from the start of yesterday to the start of today.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's system can handle the lower and upper bounds as follows: creation_timestamp_lowerbound is yesterday's midnight and upperbound is today's midnight. To calculate those timestamps, I can take the current timestamp, subtract the number of seconds in a day to get yesterday's same time, then adjust to midnight. But that might require more steps. However, given the available functions, perhaps the easiest way is to get the current timestamp with utilities_2, then subtract one day (using utilities_5 with days=-1) to get a timestamp from yesterday. But that would be the same time yesterday. Then, maybe set the lower bound as that timestamp minus 24 hours and upper bound as that timestamp. Wait, that would cover the 24 hours before the current time yesterday. Alternatively, perhaps using the date part only. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday is 2023-10-04. The lower bound would be 2023-10-04 00:00:00 and upper bound 2023-10-05 00:00:00. \n\nBut how to get those timestamps? Maybe using utilities_7 to get the current date, subtract a day, then set the time to midnight. However, the available functions don't allow setting specific times. Alternatively, use the current timestamp, subtract a day, then use utilities_7 to get the date, then create a new timestamp for that date at midnight. But since there's no function to build a timestamp from date parts, maybe the best approach is to calculate the start of yesterday by using the current timestamp, subtracting the number of seconds since midnight yesterday. But that's complicated. \n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe the best approach is to approximate. Let's get the current timestamp (utilities_2), subtract 24 hours (using utilities_5 with hours=-24), which gives a timestamp from yesterday at the same time. Then set the creation_timestamp_lowerbound to that value minus (24*3600) seconds (which would be the same time two days ago) and upperbound to current timestamp minus 24 hours. Wait, no. Alternatively, to capture all of yesterday, the lowerbound could be current timestamp minus 2 days, and upperbound minus 1 day. But that might not be accurate. Wait, if the current time is 3 PM today, then yesterday's 3 PM is 24 hours ago. To get all reminders created between midnight yesterday and midnight today, the lowerbound would be (current timestamp - 24 hours) minus the time part. For example, if current time is 3 PM, then subtract 15 hours to get midnight yesterday. But how to calculate that without knowing the current time's hour?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the utilities_7 function to get the current date, subtract a day, then use that date's midnight as lowerbound and the next day's midnight as upperbound. But since there's no function to create a timestamp from a date, maybe the best way is to use the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a point in yesterday, then set lowerbound to that minus (24*3600 + current timestamp % 86400) to get midnight. Hmm, this is getting too complex. Maybe the user's system can handle a rougher range. \n\nAlternatively, just use the creation_timestamp_upperbound as the current timestamp minus 24 hours (yesterday's time) and creation_timestamp_lowerbound as current timestamp minus 48 hours, but that would include two days. Not ideal. Wait, the user wants reminders created yesterday. So the lowerbound is midnight yesterday, upperbound midnight today. To get those timestamps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2) -> now.\n2. Shift now by days=-1, hours=-now_hour, minutes=-now_minutes, seconds=-now_seconds. That would take us to midnight yesterday. But how to get the current hour, minutes, seconds? Use utilities_7 on the current timestamp to get those values. Then subtract the appropriate values. For example:\n\ncurrent_timestamp = utilities_2()\ndate_info = utilities_7(current_timestamp)\nmidnight_today = current_timestamp - (date_info['hour']*3600 + date_info['minute']*60 + date_info['second'])\nmidnight_yesterday = midnight_today - 86400\nmidnight_tomorrow = midnight_today + 86400\n\nThen, the creation_timestamp_upperbound is midnight_today, and lowerbound is midnight_yesterday. This way, the range covers all of yesterday.\n\nBut since I can't chain function calls in the current setup, I need to make multiple steps. However, the assistant can't store variables, so each step requires a function call.\n\nFirst, get the current timestamp with utilities_2. Then, use utilities_7 to get the date info of the current timestamp. Then, calculate midnight_today by subtracting the time part (hours, minutes, seconds). Then subtract 86400 to get midnight_yesterday.\n\nBut since the assistant can only call functions and can't compute values, this might require several steps.\n\nWait, but the assistant can call utilities_7 on the current timestamp to get the hour, minute, second, then use utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp by those negative values to get midnight today. Then subtract another day to get midnight yesterday.\n\nBut how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst step: call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n\nThen call utilities_7 on that timestamp to get the current date info, including hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, shift the current timestamp by hours=-hour, minutes=-minute, seconds=-second to get midnight today.\n\nThen, shift that by days=-1 to get midnight yesterday.\n\nThen, the range for creation_timestamp is midnight_yesterday to midnight_today.\n\nBut since the assistant can't do this in a single step, it has to make multiple function calls.\n\nHowever, in the context of the user's question, the assistant needs to generate the appropriate function calls. Let's outline this:\n\nFirst, get current timestamp:\n\nCall utilities_2().\n\nThen, call utilities_7 with the current timestamp to get date info.\n\nAssuming the response includes hour, minute, second.\n\nThen, call utilities_5 with the current timestamp and hours=-h, minutes=-m, seconds=-s to get midnight_today.\n\nThen call utilities_5 again with midnight_today and days=-1 to get midnight_yesterday.\n\nThen, set creation_timestamp_lowerbound to midnight_yesterday and upperbound to midnight_today.\n\nBut since the assistant can't execute these steps in a loop, but must generate the necessary function calls in sequence, perhaps the correct approach is to first get the current timestamp, then calculate midnight yesterday and midnight today using those functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the current timestamp and shift it back one day, then use that as a reference. However, without knowing the exact time, this might not capture the entire day. For example, if the current time is 3 PM, shifting back one day gives yesterday at 3 PM, so the range from that time to current time minus 2 days would miss the earlier part of yesterday.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to proceed, perhaps the best approach is to approximate the range. For instance, set creation_timestamp_upperbound to the current timestamp minus 24 hours (which would be roughly yesterday's same time) and lowerbound to current_timestamp minus 48 hours. However, this would include both yesterday and the day before. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_NAME_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
