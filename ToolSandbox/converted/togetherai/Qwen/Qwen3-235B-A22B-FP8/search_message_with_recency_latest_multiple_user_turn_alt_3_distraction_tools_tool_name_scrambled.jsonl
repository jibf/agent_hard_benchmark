But the tools provided don't have a function to retrieve the current user's details unless they use utilities_2 or others, which they already tried.\n\nWait, the user might not know their phone number, but maybe the system can prompt them to check their account settings. However, the tools available don't include a function to retrieve user profile info. The available functions are messaging_0, utilities_2, 5, 6, 8. So the assistant can't fetch user details beyond what's in the message data.\n\nGiven that, the assistant can't proceed further without more info. The best course is to inform the user that without their phone number or person ID, the system can't filter messages for them. Maybe suggest that if they have access to their account, they should check their profile for the phone number. Alternatively, if they remember any part of the message content or sender's number, that could help. But since the user says they don't have any other details, the assistant has to conclude that it's not possible.\n\nSo the response should be empathetic, reiterate the need for an identifier, and offer possible steps the user can take to find their phone number if they're logged in.
