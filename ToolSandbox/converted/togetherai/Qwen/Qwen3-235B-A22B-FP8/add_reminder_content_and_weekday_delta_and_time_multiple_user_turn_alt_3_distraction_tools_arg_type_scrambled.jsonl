Let me figure out how to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact date and time for next Friday. Since today's date isn't provided, I'll have to calculate it. Wait, but the functions available include get_current_timestamp, which can get the current time. Let me use that to find the current date and then find the next Friday.\n\nWait, but the user might not be in the same time zone. Hmm, but the functions don't mention time zones, so I'll assume the user's local time. Alternatively, maybe the timestamp functions handle UTC, but I'm not sure. The problem says \"next Friday 5PM\" so I need to parse that relative to the current date.\n\nSo first, get the current timestamp. Then, find the next Friday. Let me think. Using get_current_timestamp() gives me the current time. Then, using timestamp_to_datetime_info to get the current day of the week. Let's say today is Wednesday, then next Friday would be in two days. If today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days. Wait, but \"next Friday\" usually means the upcoming Friday, not the same day. Wait, if today is Friday, then next Friday would be in 7 days. So regardless of today's day, next Friday would be the next occurrence after this week's Friday. Wait, no. If today is Thursday, next Friday is in 1 day. If today is Friday, then next Friday is in 7 days. If today is Saturday, next Friday is in 6 days. So the process is: find the current day, calculate how many days to add to get to the next Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the first Friday after the current date. So if today is Friday, then next Friday would be in 7 days. Otherwise, calculate the days needed to reach the next Friday.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp using get_current_timestamp().\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current day of the week (isoweekday: 1=Monday, 7=Sunday).\n3. Calculate days until next Friday. Let's see: Friday is day 5. So if today is day 5, then next Friday is in 7 days. If today is before Friday (1-4), then add (5 - day) days. If today is after Friday (6,7), then add (5 - day + 7) days. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor example:\n- Today is Monday (1): 5-1=4 days, so next Friday is in 4 days.\n- Tuesday (2): 5-2=3 days.\n- Wednesday (3): 5-3=2 days.\n- Thursday (4): 5-4=1 day.\n- Friday (5): next Friday is 7 days later.\n- Saturday (6): 5 -6 +7 = 6 days? Wait 5-6 is -1, +7 gives 6. So Saturday to next Friday is 6 days. Sunday (7): 5-7+7= 5-7 is -2 +7=5 days. Wait, Sunday to Friday is 5 days. Hmm, that formula works.\n\nSo the formula is: days_until = (5 - isoweekday) % 7. If today is Friday, (5-5) =0, mod 7 is 0, but then we need to add 7 days instead. Wait, no. Because if today is Friday, then (5-5) is 0, so adding 0 days would be same day. But \"next Friday\" would mean the next week's Friday, so we need to add 7 days. So perhaps the formula should be: days_until = (5 - isoweekday + 7) % 7. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf today is Friday (5): (5-5+7) mod7=7 mod7=0. Hmm, same. So maybe the correct formula is (5 - isoweekday) if it's positive, else (5 - isoweekday +7). Wait, perhaps better to calculate:\n\nIf current_day < 5: days_until = 5 - current_day\nIf current_day >5: days_until = (7 - current_day +5)\nIf current_day ==5: days_until =7.\n\nAlternatively, days_until = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Wait, let's test:\n\ncurrent_day=1 (Monday): (5-1+7)=11 mod7=4. Correct.\ncurrent_day=2: (5-2+7)=10 mod7=3. Correct.\ncurrent_day=3: (5-3+7)=9 mod7=2. Correct.\ncurrent_day=4: (5-4+7)=8 mod7=1. Correct.\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0. Hmm, but we need 7 days. So that formula gives 0, which would mean same day. Not correct.\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6+7)=6 mod7=6. Correct.\ncurrent_day=7: (5-7+7)=5 mod7=5. Correct.\n\nAh, so when current_day is 5, the formula gives 0. But in that case, we need to add 7 days. So the correct formula would be:\n\nif current_day is 5 (Friday), then days_until =7\nelse:\n   days_until = (5 - current_day +7) %7\n\nSo how to handle that. Let me think. Let's get the current day from the datetime_info. Then:\n\nif isoweekday ==5:\n   days_until=7\nelse:\n   days_until = (5 - isoweekday +7) %7\n\nThis way, when it's Friday, next Friday is 7 days later.\n\nOnce days_until is determined, then we can add days to the current timestamp. Also, set the time to 5 PM.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp.\n2. Convert to datetime info to get current day.\n3. Calculate days_until as above.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_until days.\n5. Then set the time to 5 PM (17:00:00).\n\nWait, but shifting by days_until days would take us to the correct date, but time would be same as current. So, for example, if current time is 10 AM, shifting by days_until would take us to next Friday at 10 AM. So we need to adjust the time to 5 PM.\n\nSo after shifting the days, we need to set the hour, minute, and second.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the timestamp for next Friday, we can convert it to a datetime_info, adjust the hour, minute, second, and then convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent_ts = get_current_timestamp()\ncurrent_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=current_ts)\n\ndays_until = 7 if current_dt['isoweekday'] ==5 else (5 - current_dt['isoweekday'] +7) %7\n\nshifted_ts = shift_timestamp(timestamp=current_ts, days=days_until)\n\n# Now, set the time to 5 PM. So get shifted_dt, then set hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nshifted_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=shifted_ts)\n\n# Now, create a new datetime with hour=17, minute=0, second=0. Then convert to timestamp.\n\n# So, using datetime_info_to_timestamp function?\n\nWait, but the functions don't have a function to convert datetime info back to timestamp. There's datetime_info_to_timestamp, but looking at the functions provided, there's a function called datetime_info_to_timestamp. Wait, no, the functions listed have:\n\ndatetime_info_to_timestamp: Convert date time information to POSIX timestamp. The parameters are year, month, day, hour, minute, second.\n\nSo yes. So after shifting the days, we can take the shifted timestamp, convert to datetime_info, then set hour to 17, minute and second to 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo:\n\nshifted_dt = timestamp_to_datetime_info(timestamp=shifted_ts)\nadjusted_dt = {\n    'year': shifted_dt['year'],\n    'month': shifted_dt['month'],\n    'day': shifted_dt['day'],\n    'hour': 17,\n    'minute': 0,\n    'second': 0\n}\nadjusted_ts = datetime_info_to_timestamp(**adjusted_dt)\n\nThen, use add_reminder with content \"Reminder next Friday 5PM\" and adjusted_ts.\n\nWait, but what if the user's current time is after 5 PM? For example, if today is Friday and current time is 6 PM, then shifting by 7 days would take us to next Friday, but then setting time to 5 PM. So the reminder would be for next Friday at 5 PM, which is correct.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nFirst, call get_current_timestamp().\n\nThen, convert to datetime info to get isoweekday.\n\nCalculate days_until next Friday (if current is Friday, 7 days, else (5 - day +7)%7).\n\nShift current timestamp by days_until days.\n\nConvert shifted timestamp to datetime info.\n\nSet hour to 17, minute 0, second 0.\n\nConvert back to timestamp.\n\nThen add_reminder with content and this timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle this in the tool calls?\n\nThe problem is that each step requires a function call, so the assistant needs to chain these steps.\n\nBut since the user is asking to add a reminder, the assistant must generate the", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "MULTIPLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
