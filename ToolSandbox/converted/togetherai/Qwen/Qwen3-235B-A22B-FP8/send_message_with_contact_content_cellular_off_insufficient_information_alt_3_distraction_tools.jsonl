Let me see what tools I have available. There's the send_message_with_phone_number function, which requires a phone number and content. But wait, do I have Fredrik's phone number? The user didn't provide it. I can't assume that. So maybe I need to check if there's another way. The other functions are about cellular service, location, wifi status, and setting those. None of those seem relevant here. So the problem is that to send a message, I need a phone number, which isn't provided. I should inform the user that I can't send the message without the phone number. Alternatively, maybe check if there's a way to get the phone number, but the tools don't include that. So the answer is that I can't perform this action because the phone number isn't provided.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to Fredrik Thordendal's phone number or a way to contact him directly.

I responded that I don't have his phone number and offered help with device connectivity. Now the user says they don't know his number either.\n\nHmm, so the user realizes they can't send the message without the number. Maybe they're looking for another way to get in touch or want to check if there's another function available. Let me check the tools again. The available functions are for cellular, wifi, location status, sending messages (with number and content), and toggling cellular/wifi on/off. \n\nSince the user can't provide a phone number, sending a message isn't possible. They might need help with something else. The other functions are status checks or enabling/disabling services. Maybe the user wants to check if their own services are on, like cellular or wifi. Alternatively, they might have a different request related to these functions. \n\nI should prompt them to ask if they need help with checking service statuses or enabling/disabling something. That way, I cover the available tools and offer assistance where possible. Let's phrase it in a friendly way to encourage them to specify their next move.\n</think>\n\nSince neither of us has Fredrik Thordendal's phone number, I can't help send that message.

I need to check if there's any function available that can help send a message without the number. The available functions include sending a message with a phone number, but that requires the number and content. Since the user doesn't have the number, I can't proceed with that. The other functions are for checking service statuses, which aren't relevant here. So, I should inform the user that without the phone number, sending the message isn't possible and maybe suggest they check if they can get the number through another means.

They mentioned they were just trying to send that message and don't need help with anything else. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm that without the phone number, the send_message function can't be used.

They might be ending the conversation here. My job is to acknowledge their thanks and offer further assistance if needed. \n\nI should make sure my response is polite, confirms that they're all set, and leaves the door open in case they come back with another request. No functions need to be called here since the user isn't asking for any action anymore.\n</think>\n\nYou're welcome! If you ever need help with anything else, feel free to ask.
