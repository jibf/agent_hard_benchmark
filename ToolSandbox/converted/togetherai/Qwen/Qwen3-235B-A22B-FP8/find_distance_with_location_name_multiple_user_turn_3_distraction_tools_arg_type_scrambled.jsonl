The tool response includes latitude and longitude, but they might not know how to use that. Should I mention how to use those coordinates in a map service? Or perhaps suggest looking it up on Google Maps for a visual? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to know the distance from their current location. If they allowed location access, I could calculate the distance. But the previous attempts didn't include that. The tools available include calculate_lat_lon_distance, but I don't have the user's current location. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided their location, I can't calculate the distance.

Maybe they need to see it in a different format. Also, check if there's any other function that could help, but the available tools don't have anything else beyond what's been used. \n\nSo the response should summarize the key points again, perhaps more concisely, and offer further assistance if needed.
