They want to know the reminders they had set for yesterday. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the time frame for yesterday. Since the current date isn't provided, I might need to get the current timestamp. But wait, the functions available include search_reminder, which can take a reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. \n\nTo find yesterday's reminders, I need to calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamps. Let's say today is a certain date. For example, if today is October 10th, 2023, then yesterday would be October 9th, 00:00 to 23:59:59. But how do I get the current date?\n\nLooking at the tools, there's the timestamp_to_datetime_info function which can convert a timestamp to date info. Also, there's the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to create a timestamp from date components. \n\nBut maybe the user doesn't have a specific date in mind, so the system should use the current date. However, the functions don't have a way to get the current timestamp directly. Wait, there's the timestamp_diff function, but that requires two timestamps. Alternatively, maybe the search_reminder function can handle the time range based on the current time.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects that \"yesterday\" is relative to the current date. To compute that, I need to know the current date. But since the assistant can't know the current date without a function, maybe the functions like datetime_info_to_timestamp can be used if we can get the current date components. However, looking at the available tools, there's no function to get the current date. Hmm.\n\nWait, there's the timestamp_to_datetime_info function which takes a timestamp. But without knowing the current timestamp, how can I proceed? Maybe the system can assume that the user's device has the current time, and the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. But since the assistant can't get the current timestamp directly from the tools provided, perhaps this is a limitation.\n\nWait, the user might expect that the assistant can calculate \"yesterday\" based on the current date. However, without knowing the current date, the assistant can't compute the exact timestamps. So maybe the assistant needs to ask the user for the specific date or confirm that the current date should be used. But according to the initial instruction, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions and should ask for clarification if needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the search_reminder function with a relative time frame. Wait, the search_reminder function allows for reminder_timestamp_upperbound and lowerbound. So if the assistant can calculate the start and end of yesterday in seconds since epoch, that would work.\n\nBut how to calculate yesterday's start and end without knowing the current date? It's impossible. Therefore, the assistant needs to inform the user that it can't determine the current date and needs clarification. However, maybe the system can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function with the current timestamp, but since the assistant can't get the current timestamp from the tools, this might not be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the fact that \"yesterday\" is 24 hours before the current time. But that's not accurate because daylight saving changes can affect it. Alternatively, subtract 24 hours from the current time, but again, without knowing the current time, this isn't feasible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the assistant might need to respond that it can't accurately determine yesterday's date range without knowing the current date. Therefore, the assistant should ask the user to clarify or provide the specific date. However, the user's query is straightforward, so maybe there's a way to proceed.\n\nWait, looking back at the functions, there's the shift_timestamp function which can shift a timestamp by deltas. But again, without a base timestamp, it's not helpful. The assistant might need to inform the user that it can't proceed without knowing the current date. But the user might expect that the assistant can use the device's current date. However, since the functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the search_reminder function with a relative time range. For example, reminders that are due in the past 24 to 48 hours. But that's not exactly \"yesterday.\" Alternatively, the assistant can search for reminders with a reminder_timestamp_upperbound as the start of today and lowerbound as the start of yesterday plus one day.\n\nBut without knowing today's date, this is impossible. Therefore, the assistant should probably ask the user to clarify the date. However, the initial instruction says not to make assumptions. So the correct approach here is to inform the user that the assistant can't determine the date for \"yesterday\" without knowing the current date, and ask for clarification. But since the user might expect the assistant to use the current date, perhaps there's a way to get the current timestamp through the functions.\n\nWait, the functions don't include a way to get the current timestamp. The closest is timestamp_to_datetime_info, which requires a timestamp. So the assistant can't get the current date. Therefore, the assistant must respond that it can't proceed without knowing the current date. But the user's query is about \"yesterday,\" which is relative. This seems like a limitation in the available tools.\n\nIn that case, the assistant should explain that it can't determine the date for yesterday without knowing the current date and ask the user to provide the specific date. Alternatively, if the assistant can assume that the system has access to the current timestamp, perhaps through an external source, but since the tools don't provide it, the assistant can't use it.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the assistant can't determine the date for yesterday without knowing the current date. However, given that the user is asking about their own reminders, it's reasonable to assume that the system has access to the current date. But since the tools don't include a function to get the current timestamp, the assistant can't proceed.\n\nWait, looking again at the tools: there's the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. If the assistant can get the current date components (year, month, day, etc.), it can create a timestamp. But how to get the current date components? There's no function like get_current_datetime_info. The get_current_location and others are for location, not time.\n\nTherefore, the assistant can't compute \"yesterday\" without the current date. So the assistant must ask the user to clarify with a specific date. However, the user's query is ambiguous because \"yesterday\" depends on the current date. Therefore, the assistant should respond by asking for the current date to proceed, or state that it can't determine it.\n</think>\n\nTo check your reminders from yesterday, I need to determine the date range for \"yesterday\" in POSIX timestamps. However, I don't have access to the current date/time to calculate this. Could you confirm the current date, or provide a specific date for which you'd like to see reminders? \n\nAlternatively, if your system has a way to provide the current timestamp, I can use that to compute the exact range.", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
