The user asked how much $2.048k is in CNY. First, I need to parse the input correctly. The amount is given as $2.048k. The 'k' here stands for thousand, so that's 2.048 thousand dollars. Converting that to a numerical value, it would be 2048 USD.\n\nNext, the user wants this converted into CNY, which is the Chinese Yuan. The function provided is convert_currency, which requires amount, from_currency_code, and to_currency_code. The amount is 2048, from_currency_code is USD, and to_currency_code is CNY. So I need to call the function with these parameters.\n\nWait, the user might be confused about the 'k' notation. Let me confirm: 2.048k is indeed 2048. Also, checking the currency codes, USD is correct for US Dollar and CNY for Chinese Yuan. The function should handle the conversion rate. The response from the tool was 14705.152 CNY. That seems reasonable based on current exchange rates I'm aware of, maybe a bit rounded. But since the tool's response is given, I just need to present that number to the user in a clear way. \n\nI should format the answer to show the converted amount, possibly with two decimal places as is standard for currency. So 14705.15 CNY. Also, mention the original amount in USD for clarity. Make sure there's no confusion about the units. The user might also appreciate a brief note that exchange rates fluctuate, but since the tool provided a specific value, maybe just stick to that unless instructed otherwise. \n\nDouble-checking all parameters to ensure no typos. The function was called correctly with the right codes. Yes, everything looks good. Present the answer clearly now.\n</think>\n\n$2,048 USD is equivalent to Â¥14,705.15 CNY based on the current exchange rate.", "turn_idx": 2}], "eval_result": {"score": 1.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "SINGLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "NO_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 1.0, "turn_count": 3, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [17, 1.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
