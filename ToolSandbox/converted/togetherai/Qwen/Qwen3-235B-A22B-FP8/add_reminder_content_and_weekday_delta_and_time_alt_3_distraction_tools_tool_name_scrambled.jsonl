Let me figure out how to use the tools provided.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the POSIX timestamp for next Friday 5 PM. But wait, the current date isn't given, so I should probably use the utilities_2 function to get the current timestamp. Then, calculate the difference between the current date and next Friday. However, since the user mentioned \"next Friday,\" I need to make sure that if today is Friday, it's still considered next Friday. Wait, sometimes \"next Friday\" can be ambiguous, but I'll assume it's the upcoming Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use utilities_5 to shift the current timestamp to next Friday. But how? Let me think. If today is Wednesday, next Friday is two days away. If today is Friday, then next Friday is seven days later. To handle this, perhaps I need to find out the current day of the week. Using utilities_7 on the current timestamp would give me the isoweekday. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, call utilities_2 to get the current timestamp. Then, convert that timestamp to date info using utilities_7. Let's say the current isoweekday is, for example, 3 (Wednesday). Then, next Friday would be (5 - 3) days = 2 days. If today is Friday (isoweekday 5), then next Friday is 7 days later. So the delta would be (5 - current_day + 7) % 7 days? Wait, maybe another approach: calculate how many days until next Friday. If today is Friday, add 7 days. Otherwise, add (5 - current_day) if that's positive, else add (5 - current_day + 7). Wait, isoweekday is 1-7, with Monday=1, Friday=5. So if current_day is 5 (Friday), then next Friday is 7 days later. If current_day is 6 (Saturday), then next Friday is 6 days later (since 5 - 6 +7 =6). So the formula could be: days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) % 7. If it's 0, add 7 days. Wait, let's test:\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): (5-5+7)=7 mod7=0 → days_to_add=7?\nBut 0 would mean same day, so maybe if days_to_add is 0, add 7 days. So the logic is: if today is Friday, next Friday is 7 days from now. Otherwise, days_to_add = (5 - current_day + 7) %7. Wait, for example:\n\ncurrent_day=3 (Wednesday): 5-3=2, +7=9 mod7=2 → days_to_add=2. So add 2 days.\n\ncurrent_day=5 (Friday): 5-5=0 +7=7 mod7=0 → days_to_add=0, but we need to add 7 days.\n\nHmm, so maybe if days_to_add is 0, set it to 7. So the formula would be:\n\ndays_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7\n\nif days_to_add ==0, days_to_add=7.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\ncurrent_day=5: (5-5)=0 mod7=0 → days_to_add=7.\n\ncurrent_day=6: (5-6)= -1 mod7=6 → days_to_add=6.\n\ncurrent_day=3: 5-3=2 mod7=2 → days_to_add=2.\n\nYes, that works. So once I get the current isoweekday, I can calculate the days_to_add as (5 - current_day) %7. If that's 0, set to 7. Then, add days_to_add days and 5 PM (17 hours) to the current timestamp.\n\nBut how to handle the time part. The user said 5 PM, so the time should be 17:00:00. So the steps are:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (utilities_2).\n2. Convert current timestamp to date info (utilities_7) to get isoweekday.\n3. Calculate days_to_add based on isoweekday.\n4. Shift the current timestamp by days_to_add days, 17 hours, and set minutes and seconds to 0.\nWait, but shifting by days and hours. So after getting the current timestamp, add days_to_add days and 17 hours. Then, set the minutes and seconds to 0? Or do I need to calculate the exact time?\n\nAlternatively, after determining the date of next Friday, set the time to 17:00:00.\n\nSo, let's outline:\n\n- Get current timestamp (current_ts) via utilities_2.\n- Get current_date_info = utilities_7(timestamp=current_ts)\n- current_day = current_date_info['isoweekday']\n- days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If days_to_add ==0, days_to_add=7.\n- Then, create a new timestamp by adding days_to_add days to current_ts, then set the hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nBut how to handle the time part. Because adding days_to_add days and then setting the time to 17:00:00. But adding days_to_add days to current_ts would take care of the date, but the time would be the same as current. So perhaps after adding days_to_add days, we need to adjust the time to 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but how to adjust the time. For example, current timestamp is 2023-10-03 14:30:00 (Tuesday). Next Friday is 2023-10-06. So we need to set the time to 17:00:00 on that day.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current_ts via utilities_2.\n\n2. Get current_date_info via utilities_7(current_ts).\n\n3. current_day = current_date_info['isoweekday']\n\n4. days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If days_to_add ==0 → 7.\n\n5. Shift current_ts by days_to_add days using utilities_5, but then set the hour to 17, minutes 0, seconds 0.\n\nWait, but how to set the hour, minutes, seconds. The utilities_5 function allows adding weeks, days, etc., but not setting specific times. So perhaps after shifting days_to_add days, we need to create a new date with that date plus 17:00:00.\n\nAlternatively, convert the shifted timestamp to date info, then create a new timestamp with year, month, day, 17, 0, 0.\n\nSo:\n\n- shifted_ts = utilities_5(timestamp=current_ts, days=days_to_add, hours=0, minutes=0, seconds=0)\n\nWait, no. Wait, utilities_5 shifts the timestamp by the deltas provided. So if current_ts is 2023-10-03 14:30:00, adding days_to_add days would take it to 2023-10-06 14:30:00. Then, to get to 17:00:00, we need to add (17 - 14) hours and subtract 30 minutes and 0 seconds. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after getting the date (year, month, day) of next Friday, create a new timestamp for that date at 17:00:00.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. current_ts = utilities_2()\n\n2. current_info = utilities_7(current_ts)\n\n3. current_day = current_info['isoweekday']\n\n4. days_to_add = (5 - current_day) %7. If days_to_add ==0 → 7.\n\n5. shifted_ts = utilities_5(timestamp=current_ts, days=days_to_add)\n\n6. shifted_info = utilities_7(shifted_ts)\n\nAt this point, shifted_info has the date (year, month, day) of next Friday, but the time is same as current_ts.\n\nThen, create a new timestamp for shifted_info['year'], shifted_info['month'], shifted_info['day'], 17, 0, 0.\n\nBut how to create that timestamp. The utilities_1 function converts date time to POSIX. So:\n\n7. Use utilities_1 with year=shifted_info['year'], month=shifted_info['month'], day=shifted_info['day'], hour=17, minute=0, second=0.\n\nThat would give the correct timestamp for next Friday at 17:00.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Get current timestamp.\n\n- Calculate the date for next Friday.\n\n- Create a new timestamp for that date at 17:00:00.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nFirst, call utilities_2 to get current timestamp.\n\nThen, call utilities_7 on current timestamp to get current day.\n\nCalculate days_to_add.\n\nCall utilities_5 to shift current timestamp by days_to_add days (to get to next Friday's date, same time).\n\nThen, get the year, month, day from that shifted timestamp, then call utilities_1 to create a new timestamp for that date at 17:00:00.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way.
