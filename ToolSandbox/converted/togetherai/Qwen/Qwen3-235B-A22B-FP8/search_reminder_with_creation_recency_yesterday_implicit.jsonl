item I made yesterday?\" So I need to figure out which functions to use here. Let's start by understanding what the user needs. They want to retrieve a reminder (todo item) that they created yesterday. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the time frame for \"yesterday.\" To do that, I should get the current timestamp using the get_current_timestamp function. Once I have the current timestamp, I can calculate the time range for yesterday. \n\nWait, how do I define yesterday? Let's say the current time is T. Yesterday would be from T minus 24 hours to T minus 48 hours? No, wait. Actually, if today is the 5th, then yesterday is the 4th. But depending on the exact time, maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, using the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday and subtract 48 hours to get the end. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday (midnight?), and then subtract another 24 hours to get the upper and lower bounds. Hmm, maybe not. The user might mean any time created between 24 hours ago and 48 hours ago. Or maybe they want the previous day's date regardless of the time. This could be ambiguous.\n\nBut since the functions allow for a lower and upper bound on the creation_timestamp, I can calculate those bounds. Let me first get the current timestamp. Then, shift it back by 24 hours to get the start of yesterday and then shift back another 24 hours for the upper bound. Wait, no. Let me think: if the user created a reminder yesterday, the creation_timestamp should be between 24 hours ago (lower bound) and 48 hours ago (upper bound)? No, wait, if today is Monday, then yesterday is Sunday. So from the current time, subtract 24 hours to get to the same time on Sunday, and subtract another 24 hours to get to Saturday. But that's not right. Wait, actually, to get the start of yesterday (midnight), maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the user considers \"yesterday\" as any time in the past 24 to 48 hours. But this might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the user means the creation date was yesterday's date. So to cover all reminders created on that day, regardless of the time. To get that, I need to find the start and end of yesterday in terms of the user's local time. However, since the system might not have timezone info, perhaps using the current timestamp and subtracting 24 hours to get a lower bound, and then subtracting another 24 hours for the upper bound? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose current time is T. Yesterday's day (regardless of time) would be from T - 24 hours to T - 48 hours? No. Wait, for example, if today is 9 AM on Monday, then yesterday at 9 AM was Sunday. So to get all reminders created on Sunday (yesterday's date), assuming that the user's day starts at midnight. But without knowing the user's timezone or how the dates are stored, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the user considers \"yesterday\" as between 24 and 48 hours ago. For example, if the current time is Monday 10 AM, then yesterday would be Sunday 10 AM to Monday 10 AM. Wait, no. Wait, \"yesterday\" typically refers to the previous calendar day, which would be from midnight to midnight. But without knowing the user's timezone, it's hard to get exact dates. However, the user might be referring to the past 24 hours. But the user's query is ambiguous here.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the creation_timestamp_lowerbound as (current timestamp - 48 hours) and creation_timestamp_upperbound as (current timestamp - 24 hours). That way, it covers the 24-hour period before yesterday. Wait, no. Wait, if current time is T, then T-24h would be yesterday's time. So if I set lowerbound as T-48h and upperbound as T-24h, that would cover the time two days ago to yesterday. That's not right. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose today is Monday, and the current time is 3 PM. Then, yesterday (Sunday) was from 3 PM on Sunday to 3 PM on Monday. Wait, no. If the user made a reminder \"yesterday\" in terms of calendar day, say on Sunday, regardless of the time, then we need to find all reminders created between the start of Sunday and the end of Sunday. But without knowing the user's timezone, this is difficult. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user means \"yesterday\" as in the 24-hour period before now. For example, from 24 hours ago to now. But that would include today's time. Hmm, no. Wait, if the user says \"yesterday\", they probably mean the previous day, not the last 24 hours. But since the function can't do date-based filtering (only timestamps), maybe we need to approximate. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have created the reminder at any time during the previous 24 hours. Wait, but \"yesterday\" is a bit ambiguous. For example, if it's 8 AM today, \"yesterday\" would refer to the 24-hour period before 8 AM yesterday. But maybe the user is referring to the previous day's date. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to use the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours to get a lower bound and subtract 48 hours to get an upper bound. Wait, no. Wait, if I want reminders created between 24 hours ago and 48 hours ago, that would be between 1 and 2 days ago, which would be the day before yesterday? No, wait:\n\nLet's say current time is 5 PM Monday. 24 hours ago is 5 PM Sunday (yesterday). 48 hours ago is 5 PM Saturday. So if I set lowerbound to 48 hours ago and upperbound to 24 hours ago, that would cover Saturday 5 PM to Sunday 5 PM, which is not exactly yesterday. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct. \n\nAlternatively, to capture all of yesterday (the calendar day), regardless of when today is, we need to find the start and end of yesterday. But how to compute that without knowing the timezone? Let's think: using the current timestamp, we can convert it to a datetime structure (like year, month, day, etc.), subtract one day to get yesterday's date, then compute the timestamp for midnight of that day and midnight of today. Then, the lowerbound would be the start of yesterday, and the upperbound would be the start of today.\n\nBut since the available functions don't allow converting a date back to a timestamp, maybe the assistant can't do that. The functions provided include timestamp_to_datetime_info, which can convert a timestamp to date components. But then, how to reconstruct the timestamp for midnight of yesterday?\n\nAlternatively, the assistant can first get the current timestamp with get_current_timestamp, then shift it back by 24 hours to get a timestamp that's 24 hours ago. Then, using that as the lower bound, but how to get the full day of yesterday?\n\nWait, maybe the user's query is best handled by setting the creation_timestamp_upperbound to the current timestamp, and the creation_timestamp_lowerbound to 48 hours ago, but that would cover the last two days, which might include more than just yesterday.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function to subtract 24 hours from the current timestamp to get a point yesterday, then set lower and upper bounds to cover that day. But without knowing how to get the start and end of that day, this might not be feasible.\n\nGiven the functions available, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use get_current_timestamp() to get the current POSIX timestamp (T).\n2. Use shift_timestamp with T, subtract 24 hours to get T - 86400 seconds (since 1 day = 86400 seconds). Let's call this T_yesterday.\n3. Then, to get the lower and upper bounds for yesterday, we need to find the start and end of that day. However, without knowing the hour, minute, etc., we can't directly compute that. Alternatively, we can approximate by subtracting 24 hours from T and set a window around that. But maybe the user's system allows for a 24-hour window.\n\nAlternatively, since the user might not be precise, perhaps using a lowerbound of T - 48 hours and upperbound of T - 24 hours. But this would capture the period between two days ago and yesterday. That's not correct. Wait, no. If current T is Monday 12 PM, then T-24 hours is Sunday 12 PM, and T-48 hours is Saturday 12 PM. So if I set lowerbound to T-48 and upperbound to T-24, the search would find reminders created between Saturday 12 PM and Sunday 12 PM, which is Saturday's afternoon to Sunday's noon. That's not exactly yesterday (Sunday). So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother approach: To cover all of yesterday (the entire day), regardless of time, we can set lowerbound to T - 48 hours and upper", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "NO_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
