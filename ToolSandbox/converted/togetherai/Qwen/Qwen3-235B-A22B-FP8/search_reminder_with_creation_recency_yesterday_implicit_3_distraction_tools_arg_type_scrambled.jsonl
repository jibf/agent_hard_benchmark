they made yesterday. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to use the search_reminder function. But to do that, I need to determine the creation timestamp's upper and lower bounds for yesterday. Since the user wants reminders created yesterday, I should calculate the start and end of yesterday in POSIX timestamp.\n\nWait, how do I get the current timestamp? Oh, there's the get_current_timestamp function. Let me call that first. Once I have the current timestamp, I can shift it by -1 day to get yesterday's date. But wait, shifting might not account for different day lengths, but maybe using the shift_timestamp function with days=-1 will handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe convert the current timestamp to date-time info, subtract a day, then set hours to 00:00:00 for the lower bound and 23:59:59 for the upper bound. But that might require multiple steps. Let me see which functions are available.\n\nThe functions available include get_current_timestamp, shift_timestamp, and timestamp_to_datetime_info. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T) using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Subtract one day from T to get yesterday's timestamp (Y) using shift_timestamp with days=-1.\n3. Convert Y to datetime info to set the lower bound as Y's date at 00:00:00 and upper bound as 23:59:59.\n\nWait, but how to get the exact start and end of yesterday. Maybe:\n\n- Convert the current timestamp to date-time info, subtract a day to get yesterday's date, then set hours, minutes, seconds to 0 for lower bound and 23:59:59 for upper bound. Then convert those date-times back to timestamps.\n\nYes, that might be more accurate. Let me break it down:\n\na. Get current timestamp via get_current_timestamp.\nb. Convert it to datetime info using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\nc. Subtract 1 day from that date (taking care of month/year transitions), then set hours, minutes, seconds to 0 for lower bound.\nd. Set hours to 23, minutes to 59, seconds to 59 for upper bound.\ne. Convert both lower and upper datetime info to timestamps using datetime_info_to_timestamp.\nf. Use those timestamps as creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound in search_reminder.\n\nBut how do I handle step c? Because modifying the day might require adjusting month and year if it's the first day of the month. But since the functions are available, perhaps after getting the current datetime info, subtract a day, then create the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, maybe using shift_timestamp is easier. If I take the current timestamp, subtract 24 hours (which is 1 day), that would give yesterday's timestamp. Then, to find the start of that day, set hours, minutes, seconds to 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, use the shift_timestamp function with days=-1 to get a timestamp that's exactly one day before the current time. But that might not be exactly the start of yesterday, because if the current time is 10:00 AM, shifting back a day would be 10:00 AM yesterday. To get the entire day, maybe we need the lower bound as start of day and upper bound as end of day.\n\nWait, but the user wants all reminders created yesterday, regardless of the time. So perhaps the lower bound is the start of yesterday (midnight) and upper bound is the end of yesterday (23:59:59).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T) using get_current_timestamp.\n2. Convert T to datetime info (D) using timestamp_to_datetime_info.\n3. Create a new datetime info for yesterday by subtracting 1 day. Let's say D's day is day_x. Subtract 1 day. If day is 1, then go to previous month, etc. But the timestamp_to_datetime_info function might return the date components, so subtracting a day can be done by using shift_timestamp with days=-1, but maybe the user's approach is to get the current date, set to yesterday's date, then set time to 00:00:00.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Take the current timestamp, shift it by -1 day, then convert to datetime info, which would give the same date as yesterday. Then set the hours, minutes, seconds to 0 to get the lower bound. Then add 23h59m59s to get the upper bound.\n\nWait, but shifting a timestamp by -1 day (24 hours) gives a timestamp that's exactly 24 hours earlier, which may not be the same as the start of the previous day if the current time is not at midnight. However, for the purpose of getting all reminders created on yesterday (regardless of time), we need the lower and upper bounds to cover the entire previous day.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the start of the current day (midnight), then subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday, and then add 24 hours to get the start of today, so the interval [start_of_yesterday, start_of_today) would cover all timestamps created yesterday.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Get current timestamp (T).\n2. Convert T to datetime info, set hours, minutes, seconds to 0 to get start_of_today.\n3. Convert start_of_today back to timestamp (S).\n4. Subtract 24*3600 seconds (1 day) to get start_of_yesterday (S - 86400).\n5. Subtract 1 second from start_of_today to get end_of_yesterday (start_of_today -1).\n\nBut how to get start_of_today? Using timestamp_to_datetime_info on T, then datetime_info_to_timestamp with same year, month, day, but hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\nYes. Let's outline:\n\na. Call get_current_timestamp to get T.\n\nb. Convert T to datetime info D via timestamp_to_datetime_info. This gives current year, month, day, hour, etc.\n\nc. Create lower_bound_datetime = {year: D.year, month: D.month, day: D.day, hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0}.\n\nd. Convert lower_bound_datetime to timestamp S using datetime_info_to_timestamp. This is the start of today.\n\ne. Subtract 1 day (86400 seconds) from S to get start_of_yesterday = S - 86400. This is the lower bound for yesterday.\n\nf. Then, start_of_today is S. The upper bound for yesterday would be start_of_today - 1 second. So upper_bound = S - 1.\n\nWait, but if we set creation_timestamp_lowerbound to start_of_yesterday and upperbound to start_of_today -1, that covers all timestamps from yesterday's midnight to 23:59:59.\n\nWait, but start_of_today is midnight of the current day. So the previous day's start is start_of_today minus 24 hours (86400 seconds). So the lowerbound is start_of_today - 86400, upperbound is start_of_today -1.\n\nYes. So:\n\ncreation_timestamp_lowerbound = start_of_today - 86400\n\ncreation_timestamp_upperbound = start_of_today -1\n\nThis way, any reminder created between midnight of yesterday and 23:59:59 of yesterday would be included.\n\nSo to compute start_of_today:\n\nUse timestamp_to_datetime_info on T, then set hour, minute, second to 0, then convert back to timestamp.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Call get_current_timestamp() → T.\n\n2. Call timestamp_to_datetime_info with timestamp=T → D.\n\n3. Create datetime info for start_of_today: same year, month, day, but hour=0, minute=0, second=0 → call datetime_info_to_timestamp with these parameters → S.\n\n4. Compute lower_bound = S - 86400 (start of yesterday)\n\n   upper_bound = S - 1 (end of yesterday)\n\nBut how to compute S -86400? Since S is a timestamp, but the search_reminder function requires the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and upperbound as parameters. So in the search_reminder function, we can set:\n\ncreation_timestamp_lowerbound = lower_bound (S - 86400)\n\ncreation_timestamp_upperbound = upper_bound (S -1)\n\nBut how to compute these values step by step using the available functions.\n\nWait, the functions available are:\n\n- get_current_timestamp: returns current timestamp.\n\n- shift_timestamp: shifts a timestamp by weeks, days, etc.\n\n- datetime_info_to_timestamp: converts datetime info to timestamp.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAfter getting S (start of today as timestamp):\n\nlower_bound = shift_timestamp(timestamp=S, days=-1)\n\nBut wait, shifting S by -1 day would subtract 24 hours, so S is midnight today, minus one day is midnight yesterday. Then upper_bound is S -1 (midnight today minus 1 second is 23:59:59 yesterday).\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound? Since S is a timestamp, upper_bound = S - 1.\n\nBut how to do that. The shift_timestamp function can take seconds as a parameter. Wait, the shift_timestamp function's parameters include weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. So to subtract 1 second, we can call shift_timestamp with timestamp=S, seconds=-1.\n\nAlternatively, compute upper_bound = shift_timestamp(S, seconds=-1).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use S -1 as the upper bound.\n\nBut how do we", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.0, "categories": ["CANONICALIZATION", "MULTIPLE_TOOL_CALL", "SINGLE_USER_TURN", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_TYPE_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.0, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.0, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0], "1": [15, 0.0], "2": [15, 0.0]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
