Let's see.\n\nFirst, I should check the available functions. The search_reminder function can look for reminders based on various criteria. The user mentioned \"yesterday,\" so the creation timestamp is probably within that timeframe. \n\nTo get yesterday's date, I need to calculate the POSIX timestamp for the start and end of yesterday. Let's think: today's date is needed. But wait, I don't know the current date. However, I can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function to get the current time's components. Wait, but the user might not have provided the current time. Hmm, maybe I should assume the current time is now, but since the system might handle that, perhaps I should use the functions to compute the lower and upper bounds for yesterday.\n\nWait, here's the process. Let's get the current timestamp. But how? The user hasn't provided it. Oh, but maybe the functions can handle it. Wait, no, the functions don't have access to real-time data unless we use another function. Wait, maybe the user expects that the system can compute dates relative to now. But since I don't have a function that gives the current time, I need to use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's question can be addressed by determining the start and end of yesterday in terms of timestamps. Let's say that today is a certain date, but without knowing today's date, I can't compute it. Wait, but maybe the system can handle relative dates. Let me think: if today is, for example, 2023-10-05, then yesterday would be 2023-10-04. The lowerbound would be midnight of the 4th, and upperbound would be midnight of the 5th. But how to get that in a timestamp?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the shift_timestamp function. Suppose the current timestamp is known, but since I don't have that, maybe I need to use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current time. Wait, but the user hasn't provided a current timestamp. Hmm, this is a problem. How can I calculate \"yesterday\" without knowing the current date?\n\nWait, maybe the user expects that the assistant can use the current date to compute it. But since the available functions don't include getting the current time, perhaps the assistant should use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a shifted timestamp. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function by constructing yesterday's date. But to do that, the assistant needs to know today's date. Since that's not provided, perhaps the function can't be used directly. Hmm, this is a challenge. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant should call the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp (assuming that the system can get the current time). Wait, but the assistant doesn't have access to the current timestamp unless the user provides it. The functions available don't include a way to get the current time. Therefore, maybe the assistant should proceed under the assumption that the user's \"yesterday\" refers to 24 hours before the current time, but without knowing the current time, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the assistant might need to use the shift_timestamp function with the current timestamp shifted by -1 day. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the assistant can't do this without knowing the current timestamp. But since the user is asking about their own reminders, perhaps the system can access the current time, but in the context of the functions provided, there's no way to get the current time. \n\nWait, maybe the user's question is ambiguous. But the assistant needs to proceed. Let's think: perhaps the assistant should use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a hypothetical current timestamp, but since that's not provided, maybe the assistant should ask for the current date? But the user didn't provide that. Hmm. Alternatively, the assistant might need to make an assumption here. Wait, but according to the initial instruction, the assistant shouldn't make assumptions. So perhaps the correct approach is to call the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with today's date, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the assistant can't do that and needs to ask the user for the current date. But the user didn't specify that. Alternatively, the assistant might proceed by using the shift_timestamp function with a timestamp that's derived from the current date. But again, without knowing the current timestamp, this isn't feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can use the search_reminder function with the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound to cover yesterday's day. To do that, the assistant needs to compute the start and end of yesterday. Without knowing the current date, this isn't possible. Therefore, maybe the user's question is missing some information. But the assistant needs to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function on a timestamp that's derived from today's date. But again, without knowing today's date. Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Wait, but maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on the current timestamp (assuming that it's available). Wait, but the functions don't allow getting the current timestamp. \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant can't do this and should instead ask the user to clarify. But the user's question seems straightforward. Maybe there's a way to proceed. Let me think again. \n\nAssuming that \"yesterday\" refers to the day before today, the assistant needs to find the start and end of that day in POSIX timestamps. Let's suppose that the current timestamp is T. Then yesterday's start would be T minus 1 day, at 00:00:00, and end would be T minus 0 days, at 00:00:00. But how to calculate that without knowing T?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function with the current timestamp (somehow obtained) by -1 days to get the start and end. Wait, but again, without knowing the current timestamp, how can this be done? \n\nHmm. This seems impossible with the given functions unless the assistant can get the current timestamp. Since there's no function to get the current timestamp, the assistant can't proceed to calculate yesterday's timestamps. Therefore, the assistant might need to ask the user for the current date. But the user hasn't provided that. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant can make an approximate calculation. For example, if the user is asking about reminders made yesterday, the assistant can use the current time (assuming that the system has access to it) to calculate the lower and upper bounds. But since the functions don't include a way to get the current time, the assistant can't. \n\nIn this case, perhaps the assistant should proceed by using the search_reminder function with the creation_timestamp_lowerbound and creation_timestamp_upperbound parameters, but to calculate those values, the assistant needs to know today's date. Since that's not available, the assistant can't. \n\nWait, maybe the assistant should use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with the current date. For example, if today is 2023-10-05, then yesterday would be 2023-10-04. But how to get that date? Without knowing the current date, the assistant can't. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can't be solved with the available functions. However, perhaps the assistant should proceed under the assumption that the current date is known. For example, the assistant can use the datetime_info_to_timestamp function to get the start of today and then subtract 24 hours to get the start of yesterday. \n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Get today's date components (year, month, day, etc.) using timestamp_to_datetime_info with the current timestamp. But the assistant doesn't have the current timestamp. So this is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can't proceed and must ask the user to specify the date. However, the user's question is \"What's the todo item I made yesterday?\" which implies that the user expects the assistant to know the current date. \n\nBut given the functions available, how can the assistant proceed? \n\nWait, perhaps the assistant should call the datetime_info_to_timestamp function with today's date components. But since the user hasn't provided them, the assistant can't. Therefore, the assistant must make an assumption here. However, the initial instruction says not to make assumptions. \n\nThis seems like a catch-22. Maybe the assistant should proceed by using the search_reminder function with the creation_timestamp_upperbound as the start of today and creation_timestamp_lowerbound as the start of yesterday. But how to compute those timestamps without knowing today's date. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the shift_timestamp function on a timestamp that's not specified. Wait, but the shift_timestamp function requires a timestamp parameter. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. Without knowing the current timestamp, the assistant can't calculate the timestamps for yesterday. Therefore, the assistant can't use the search_reminder function properly. \n\nWait, but maybe the assistant can use the timestamp_to_datetime_info function on a hypothetical timestamp. But again, without any input, this isn't possible. \n\nIn this case, maybe the assistant should respond that it needs more information, like the current date or the date of yesterday to proceed. However, the user's question is natural and expects an answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant can use the current time as of when the query is processed. But the assistant can't do that unless there's a function to get the current time, which there isn't. \n\nWait, looking", "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
