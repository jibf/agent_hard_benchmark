Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking at the tools, there's a function called modify_contact. Wait, but the user wants to remove the contact, not modify it. Hmm, maybe there's a remove function. Let me check again. Oh, there's a remove_reminder function, but that's for reminders. Wait, the modify_contact function allows changing contact info, but there's no delete function listed. Maybe the user expects the contact to be deleted, but the available tools don't have a delete_contact function. \n\nWait, the tools include add_contact, modify_contact, search_contacts, and others. Since there's no delete function, perhaps the user's request can't be fulfilled directly. Or maybe modifying the contact to have empty fields? But the required fields are name and phone number. The user might want to delete the contact, but since the tool doesn't support it, I should inform them that deletion isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe the user can be advised to modify the contact's details instead. But the user specifically said \"get him out of my contacts,\" which implies removal. \n\nI should check again to make sure I didn't miss a function. The tools list includes functions like add, modify, search, but no delete for contacts. Therefore, I can't perform the deletion. The correct response would be to inform the user that the function to delete a contact isn't available, and suggest possible alternatives like modifying the contact's information instead.\n</think>\n\nThe user has requested to remove a contact with the phone number +12453344098. However, upon reviewing the available tools, there is no **delete_contact** function provided. The tools only support adding, modifying, and searching contacts. \n\nTo address this, the user could be informed that direct deletion isn't possible, and they might need to modify the contact's details (e.g., update the phone number or name) instead.\n\nNo valid tool call exists for this request.", "assistant_details": {"milestone_matches": [{"milestone_index": 0, "milestone": {"snapshot_constraints": [{"database_namespace": "SANDBOX", "snapshot_constraint": "snapshot_similarity", "reference_milestone_node_index": null, "target_dataframe": [{"sender": "AGENT", "recipient": "USER", "content": "I cannot remove the phone number from your contact , because I don't have the tools available."}], "column_similarity_measure": {"sandbox_message_index": "column_exact_match_similarity", "sender": "column_exact_match_similarity", "recipient": "column_exact_match_similarity", "content": "column_rouge_l_similarity", "openai_tool_call_id": "column_one_similarity", "openai_function_name": "column_one_similarity", "conversation_active": "column_exact_match_similarity", "tool_call_exception": "column_one_similarity", "tool_trace": "column_tool_trace_exact_match_similarity", "visible_to": "column_exact_match_similarity"}}], "guardrail_database_list": ["SANDBOX", "SETTING", "CONTACT", "MESSAGING", "REMINDER"], "guardrail_database_exclusion_list": null}, "milestone_similarity": 0.39172428178573643}]}, "turn_idx": 1}], "eval_result": {"score": 0.39172428178573643, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "ALL_TOOLS_AVAILABLE"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 0.39172428178573643, "minefield_similarity": 0, "similarity": 0.39172428178573643, "turn_count": 1, "milestone_mapping": {"0": [16, 0.39172428178573643]}, "minefield_mapping": {}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-15T02:21:22Z"}}
