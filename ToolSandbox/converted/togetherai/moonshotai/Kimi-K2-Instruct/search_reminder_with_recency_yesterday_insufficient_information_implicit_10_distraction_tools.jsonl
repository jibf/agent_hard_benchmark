Without using a specific app or file, here are some practical ways to recall what you worked on “yesterday” (December 19):\n\n1. Browser history  \n   - Search for “yesterday” in your browser’s history to see what sites and tools you visited.\n\n2. Email & chat logs  \n   - Check your Sent folder for yesterday’s time-stamped replies.  \n   - Glance at Slack/Teams messages or text threads you participated in.\n\n3. Recent files / downloads  \n   - Look at the “Date Modified” column in your Documents or Downloads folder and sort by yesterday.\n\n4. Terminal/command-line history (if you use it)  \n   - In macOS/Linux: `history | grep \"Dec 19\"`  \n   - In Windows PowerShell: `Get-History | Where-Object {$_.StartExecutionTime -like \"*12/19*\"}`\n\n5. Physical notes or whiteboards  \n   - Quickly scan any sticky notes, journals, or whiteboards you typically jot tasks on.\n\n6. Mental check  \n   - Ask yourself: “Who did I email or talk to?” and “What got crossed off / left unfinished?”\n\nPick whichever combination is easiest for you. Once you jot the items down, sticking them in a simple Markdown or plain-text file would help you avoid this hunt next time.", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "I usually check my recent files."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect! Try this quick scan:\n\n1. **Windows**: Open File Explorer → go to the folder you use most (Documents, Desktop, Downloads) → click the **Date modified** column to sort by newest first → filter to “**Yesterday**” in the date bar.\n\n2. **macOS**: In Finder → the folder you use most → **View ▸ as List** → click the **Date Modified** header → choose **Yesterday** from the sidebar (or just eyeball anything with “Dec 19”).\n\n3. **Linux**: From a terminal you can run  \n   `find ~ -maxdepth 2 -type f -mtime -1 -ls | sort -k9,10`  \n   (adjust the maxdepth if your projects are deeper).\n\nLook especially for files you opened/edited rather than just downloaded—they’re usually the ones you actually worked on.\n\nOnce you’ve collected those filenames, jot them down in a simple list (plain text or notes app). That becomes your “yesterday’s todo,” and tomorrow you’ll have a head-start.\n\nHappy reviewing!", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'll try that out, thanks!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!
