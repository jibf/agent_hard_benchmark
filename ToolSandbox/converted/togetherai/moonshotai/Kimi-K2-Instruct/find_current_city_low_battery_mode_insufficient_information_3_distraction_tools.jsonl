These pages usually display your approximate city based on your public IP address. You could just read the city off the screen.\n\n2. Check Wi-Fi network name or router/admin page  \n   Sometimes the SSID (network name) or the ISP’s router-status page lists the service address. If you’re on a home or hotel Wi-Fi, the ISP’s name can provide a very strong clue about the city.\n\n3. Ask another app  \n   If you use any weather, ride-share, or delivery apps that already have location permission, those apps often mention the city in their UI (e.g., “Delivering in Los Angeles”). You could open one of them and glance at the displayed location.\n\nIf any of those lead you to a latitude/longitude pair—or even just a city name—let me know and I can cross-confirm it for you.", "turn_idx": 9}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not sure how to do those right now.
