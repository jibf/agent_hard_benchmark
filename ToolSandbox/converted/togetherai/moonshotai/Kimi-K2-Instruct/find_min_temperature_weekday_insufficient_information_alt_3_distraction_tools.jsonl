Some common areas I could check include:\n\n- Major regions in the US (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest)\n- Large metropolitan areas like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, etc.\n- Or weather patterns you're currently experiencing (like \"it's been raining a lot here recently\" or \"it's been really hot lately\")\n\nYou could also try: **check your phone's weather app right now** - it will automatically show your local forecast, including Friday's low temperature.
