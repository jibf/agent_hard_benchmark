The Golden Gate Bridge is roughly 1.7 miles long, and depending on where you are in the San Francisco Bay Area (assuming that's where you are), distances can range from being right there in the Presidio area to tens of miles away in the broader region.\n\nWould any of these approaches work for you?", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "I still can't pinpoint my location accurately."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No problem!
