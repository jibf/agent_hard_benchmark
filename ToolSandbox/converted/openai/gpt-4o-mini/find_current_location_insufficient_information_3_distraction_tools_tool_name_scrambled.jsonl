It often looks like a small blue dot or a target icon.\n3. **Tap on the Location Button**: This should center the map on your current location, and you should see your address or coordinates at the bottom of the screen.\n\n### On a Computer:\n1. **Open a Web Browser**: Go to Google Maps by visiting [maps.google.com](https://maps.google.com).\n2. **Allow Location Access**: You may be prompted to allow the website to access your location. Click \"Allow\" if prompted.\n3. **Locate Yourself**: After permission is granted, click the small blue dot or icon that says \"Your location\" to find your current address.\n\n### Using a GPS Device:\n1. **Turn on the Device**: Make sure your GPS device is powered on and has a good signal.\n2. **Select “Current Location”**: Most GPS devices have a “Where Am I?” feature or a similar option that can show your current coordinates and address.\n\nLet me know if you need help with any specific step!", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "Alright, I'll try that out.
