Using your device’s built-in GPS settings (if available)  \n   - On many phones you can open Settings → Location → Location services → Systems → Tap “Location sharing” or “Manage location accuracy” and often see your current coordinates.\n\nOnce you’ve copied the latitude and longitude (or a street address), send them over and I’ll pinpoint exactly where you are.", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "Could you try checking again or maybe find another way to see your location?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I’m still unable to determine your location without some form of geographic input—whether that’s coordinates, an address, a city name, a ZIP code, or even a nearby landmark. \n\nUnfortunately I don’t have any built-in visibility into your device’s GPS or IP address. If you can’t share coordinates or an address, here are a couple more ideas:\n\n  • Enable location sharing in your browser or app and then paste the coordinates it gives you.  \n  • Use a free web service like “whatismyipaddress.com” to get an approximate location from your IP (keep in mind this is often only accurate to the city level).  \n  • Ask someone nearby for the street address or city you’re in.\n\nOnce you have any of those details, I can look up your exact location.
