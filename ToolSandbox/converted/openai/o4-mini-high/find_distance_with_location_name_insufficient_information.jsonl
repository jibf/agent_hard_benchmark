Once you have that info, just share it and I’ll compute the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n1. On an iPhone (iOS Maps or Compass)  \n   a. Open the built-in “Maps” app.  \n   b. Tap the blue dot showing your location.  \n   c. A panel will slide up displaying your coordinates (latitude & longitude).  \n   d. You can also tap “Share” to copy them.  \n   — Or—  \n   a. Open the “Compass” app (preinstalled).  \n   b. The coordinates appear at the top.\n\n2. On an Android phone (Google Maps)  \n   a. Launch Google Maps.  \n   b. Tap the blue dot marking your position.  \n   c. Your latitude/longitude will appear at the bottom in a small info card.  \n   d. Tap the card to expand and copy those numbers.\n\n3. On a Windows/Mac/Linux computer (Google Maps in a browser)  \n   a. Go to https://www.google.com/maps  \n   b. Click the “Locate” (target) icon to center the map on you (if you granted location permission).  \n   c. Right-click your blue dot (or approximate location) and choose “What’s here?”  \n   d. A box at the bottom will show the coordinates.\n\n4. Via a quick web search  \n   a. In your browser, type “what is my location” or “my latitude longitude.”  \n   b. Google (or another search engine) will display your approximate coordinates immediately.\n\n5. Find your address (if you prefer)  \n   • Instead of coords, you can share a street address, city, or ZIP code.  \n   • I can use that to estimate the distance too.\n\nOnce you’ve got either (a) latitude & longitude or (b) an address/ZIP code, just paste it here and I’ll run the distance calculation for you.", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "Let me check Google Maps.

Use a simple website that shows your lat/long without needing an app. For example:  \n   • Go to https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html  \n   • Click “Use My Location” (you may need to allow the browser to see your location)  \n   • It will display your latitude and longitude—then just copy those here.\n\nLet me know whichever works best for you (an approximate address or the coords), and I’ll calculate the distance right away.", "turn_idx": 5}, {"role": "user", "content": "I tried a few options but none are working."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No worries.
