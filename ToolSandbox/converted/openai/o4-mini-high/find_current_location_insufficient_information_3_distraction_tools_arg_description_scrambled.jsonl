Share your device’s location via your browser or app  \n   • On many phones/tablets: when prompted by the browser or app, tap “Allow” for location access.  \n   • Once you grant permission, let me know and I can read your latitude/longitude directly.\n\n2. Manually grab your GPS coordinates  \n   • Open a map app (Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.).  \n   • Tap the blue “You are here” dot.  \n   • It will show you a pair of numbers (latitude, longitude). Copy those and paste them here.\n\nEither way, once I have your latitude and longitude, I can look up your address or nearest landmark.

Here are some “no-GPS” tricks you can try—then pass me whatever you find and I’ll help pinpoint where you are:\n\n1. Check your device’s time-zone setting  \n   • iOS: Settings → General → Date & Time → Time Zone  \n   • Android: Settings → System → Date & Time → Time Zone  \n   The zone name (e.g. “America/Los_Angeles”, “GMT+1”) will at least narrow you to a region.\n\n2. Look up your mobile-carrier or Wi-Fi network name  \n   • iOS: Settings → General → About → Network  \n   • Android: Settings → About Phone → Status → Network  \n   • Or simply note the SSID of the Wi-Fi you’re on (e.g. “Starbucks-Guest,” “CityLibrary-FreeWifi”).  \n   Even a chain-store or institution name can get us very close.\n\n3. Use IP-based geolocation via a web lookup  \n   – In your browser, search “what is my IP address?” and copy the number you get (e.g. 203.0.113.45).  \n   – Then visit a site like ipinfo.io or iplocation.net—they’ll show you a city/region (and often lat/lon).  \n   Share the resulting city/coordinates here.\n\n4. Spot visual clues around you  \n   – Street signs, business names, bus/train numbers, license-plate codes, local currency…  \n   – Even the language on signs or the style of road markings can pin down a country or city.\n\nIf you gather any one of those data points—time zone, carrier/network name, public-IP lookup result, or visual clue—just paste it here. With that I can identify exactly where you are.", "turn_idx": 4}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 7, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-13T00:15:37Z"}}
