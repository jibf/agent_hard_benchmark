To look up an address for you I still need at least one piece of location information—either:\n\n• Your latitude/longitude (even an approximate pair is fine),  \n• A street address or nearby intersection, or  \n• A well-known landmark (e.g., the name of a park, railway station, large building, etc.).\n\nIf you don’t know your latitude/longitude, here are a few quick ways to find it:\n\n1. On a smartphone  \n   • Android: Open Google Maps → tap the blue “My location” dot → look for the numbers at the top (they’re your lat/lon).  \n   • iPhone: Open Apple Maps → touch and hold your location dot → swipe up on the info card to see “Latitude” and “Longitude.”\n\n2. On a computer  \n   • Go to Google Maps, right-click (or two-finger-click) on your current spot and choose “What’s here?”—the coordinates appear at the bottom.\n\n3. Using the web  \n   • Search “What is my lat long” in your browser and follow one of the location-sharing sites. Make sure you allow location access.\n\nIf none of those work, feel free to describe where you are in words (nearby streets, landmarks, city, etc.), and I’ll try to narrow it down from there.", "turn_idx": 2}, {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, I'll check it myself.
