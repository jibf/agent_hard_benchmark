Phone / tablet  \n   • iOS (iPhone, iPad): Open the Compass app (built-in). Your latitude and longitude appear at the bottom of the screen—just copy them here.  \n   • Android: Open Google Maps, press and hold on the blue “dot” that marks your location, then swipe up on the dropped pin. The coordinates are shown near the top (e.g., 37.4218, –122.0840).\n\n2. Laptop / desktop browser  \n   • Visit Google Maps (maps.google.com), click the circular “target” icon in the lower-right corner to center on your position, then right-click the blue dot and choose “What’s here?”—your coordinates pop up at the bottom.  \n   • Or look in your browser’s address bar after you click the target icon; the URL will contain “/@lat,long,” which you can copy.\n\n3. If you can’t get exact coordinates, nearby information works too  \n   Tell me the closest intersection, landmark, or business you can see (e.g., “7th Ave & W 34th St, New York” or “in front of the Eiffel Tower”), and I’ll still be able to pinpoint a location.\n\nLet me know whichever details you can provide, and I’ll translate them into an address for you!", "turn_idx": 4}, {"role": "user", "content": "I’ll try Google Maps to see if I can get my coordinates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Here’s a quick step-by-step refresher for Google Maps on a phone or computer:\n\n1. Open maps.google.com (or the Google Maps app).  \n2. Press the circular “target” icon (usually in the lower-right or upper-right corner) so it zooms to the little blue dot that marks your position.  \n3. On a phone: tap-and-hold on the blue dot until a pin drops.   \n   On a computer: right-click (or Ctrl-click) on the blue dot.  \n4. Select “What’s here?” (desktop) or just look in the info sheet (mobile).  \n5. Google Maps will show a line with two numbers such as “37.4218, −122.0840.” Copy those numbers and send them to me.\n\nOnce you have the latitude and longitude, pop them into the chat and I’ll translate them into an address or city for you.
