Smartphone map apps  \n   • On most phones, opening Google Maps, Apple Maps, or a similar app and tapping the “current-location” (target) icon will show your position.  \n   • If you tap and hold the blue dot (your location), the app will usually display the latitude and longitude.  \n\n2. Browser-based geolocation (laptop/desktop)  \n   • Go to a map website (e.g., Google Maps).  \n   • Grant the site permission to access your location; it should then center on you and show an approximate address or coordinates.  \n\n3. “Where am I?” websites  \n   • Visit sites like whatismyipaddress.com or where-am-i.net; they’ll try to use IP-based or browser geolocation to pinpoint you and will list coordinates.  \n\n4. Built-in phone settings  \n   • On iOS: Settings ➝ Privacy & Security ➝ Location Services ➝ System Services ➝ Significant Locations → the top entry is usually your current spot.  \n   • On Android: Settings ➝ Location → look for “Recent location requests” or open Google Maps → blue dot → tap to see coordinates.  \n\nOnce you have even an approximate location (a city, a neighborhood, or latitude/longitude), let me know and I’ll calculate how many kilometers you are from the Golden Gate Bridge.", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "I really have no idea where I am right now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To tell you how far you are from the Golden Gate Bridge I need at least one piece of location information—anything as specific as GPS coordinates or as general as the name of the city you’re in.  \nSince you truly don’t know where you are, here are some fast, practical ways to find out (most require only a phone or computer):\n\nA. Use your phone’s map app  \n1. Open Google Maps or Apple Maps.  \n2. Tap the round “current-location” icon (looks like a target).  \n   • A blue dot appears—this is your position.  \n3. Press-and-hold (long-press) that blue dot; the app pops up the latitude/longitude (e.g., 37.4219, –122.0840).  \n4. Tell me those numbers and I’ll calculate the distance for you.\n\nB. Ask your voice assistant  \n• Siri (iPhone): “Hey Siri, what’s my location?”  \n• Google Assistant: “Hey Google, where am I?”  \nIt will read out an approximate address or show it on-screen. Relay that address to me.\n\nC. Quick “Where am I?” websites (needs a browser)  \n1. Go to where-am-i.net or mylocation.org.  \n2. Grant the site permission to access your location.  \n3. It instantly shows coordinates and often a rough address. Copy-paste the coordinates here.\n\nD. Computer with Wi-Fi or mobile data  \n• Open Google Maps in a browser → click the small crosshair icon at bottom-right (“Show your location”).  \n• The map centers on you; right-click the blue dot → “What’s here?” → coordinates appear at the bottom.\n\nE. If none of the above works  \n• Look for nearby street signs, storefront names, transit stations, or highway markers and tell me what you see. Even that may be enough to identify your approximate location.  \n• Ask a passer-by, building receptionist, or security guard, “What city is this?” or “What’s this address?”—then pass it on.\n\nOnce you have any of the following, just send it here and I’ll give you the distance to the Golden Gate Bridge in kilometers:  \n• Latitude & longitude (best)  \n• Street address  \n• City + state/province  \n• A well-known nearby landmark or intersection.\n\nLet me know what you find, and we’ll finish the calculation.", "turn_idx": 4}], "eval_result": {"score": 1, "categories": ["INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION", "THREE_DISTRACTION_TOOLS", "TOOL_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLED"], "traceback": null, "exception_type": null, "milestone_similarity": 1, "minefield_similarity": 0.0, "similarity": 1, "turn_count": 7, "milestone_mapping": {}, "minefield_mapping": {"0": [15, 0.0]}}, "meta": {"run_timestamp": "2025-08-13T00:14:14Z"}}
