Instagram  \n   • Fredrik’s own profile has alternated between private-and-public over time, but the handle is usually @fredrikthordendal.  \n   • If it’s not currently visible, drop a polite DM to the band’s verified account, @meshuggahband, asking them to pass your question along.\n\n2. Facebook  \n   • Meshuggah run an official page (facebook.com/meshuggah). They occasionally relay fan questions in posts or Messenger.  \n   • Search for a verified “Fredrik Thordendal” musician page as well—if it shows the blue checkmark, that’s the spot to leave a short, respectful message.\n\n3. Twitter / X  \n   • The band’s account (@meshuggah) sometimes retweets member updates. Tag them with a concise question; the social-media manager may forward it.\n\n4. Management / Label contacts (publicly listed)  \n   • Management: Northern Music Co. (northernmusic.co.uk → “Contact” page)  \n   • Label: Atomic Fire Records (atomicfire-records.com → “Contact”)  \n   These addresses are business-facing, so keep your note concise and courteous—e.g., “Fan inquiry for Fredrik Thordendal regarding progress on his solo album.”\n\nTip: Whichever channel you use, lead with appreciation (“Long-time fan of Meshuggah…”) and keep the question short so it’s easy to forward.\n\nNeed help drafting a message?
