Open your reminders (or tasks) app and switch to an “Upcoming,” “Today,” or “Scheduled” view.  \n   • Most apps sort by due-date automatically, so anything with a future date should float to the top.  \n   • If you see a “No due date” section, expand it—sometimes a reminder is created without a schedule and hides there.\n\n2. Try a quick keyword search.  \n   • Think of a word that might appear in the title or notes (e.g., “doctor,” “renew,” “birthday”).  \n   • If you get lot of matches, add another term (e.g., a location, person’s name, or subject).\n\n3. Check for location-based reminders.  \n   • Many apps split them into a separate “Arriving/Leaving” or “Location” category.  \n   • Look for the little pin/geo-icon beside a reminder if you’re scrolling a list.\n\n4. Sort or filter by creation date.  \n   • If you remember roughly when you set it (e.g., “sometime last week”), sort by newest-first and scroll back to that date.\n\n5. Browse your notifications log.  \n   • On iOS you can swipe up from the lock screen or open Notification Center; on Android go to Settings → Notifications → Notification History (if enabled). A fired reminder notification often carries its title even after you dismissed it.\n\n6. Peek at related tools.  \n   • Calendar: many reminder apps mirror dated reminders into your calendar.  \n   • Email/slack: some services email you when you create a reminder—look for subject lines like “Reminder set.”\n\n7. Voice assistants.  \n   • “Hey Siri / Google / Alexa, what are my reminders?” usually reads out anything upcoming or overdue.\n\nIf none of that surfaces it, try to recall any of the following and tell me:\n\n• Rough due date (“next Monday,” “mid-June,” etc.)  \n• Where it should alert you (“at home,” “at the grocery store,” specific address)  \n• What you were doing when you set it (“right after booking my flight,” “after that meeting”)  \n• Any keyword in the title or notes  \n• Approximate time you created it (morning, evening, last weekend)\n\nEven one small detail will let me run a targeted search and pull up the entry for you.", "turn_idx": 3}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'll try checking my reminders app and see if I can find it.
