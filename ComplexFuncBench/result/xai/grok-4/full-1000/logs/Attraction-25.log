2025-08-13 22:54:33,300 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: Based on your interest in Westminster Abbey (which I agree is pretty awesome—it's one of London's most iconic landmarks), I looked it up for you. Here's a detailed overview based on the latest available info I could pull. Note that much of the structured data revolves around guided experiences, but I've focused on the key historical and descriptive details about the abbey itself.

### Overview
Westminster Abbey is a spectacular Medieval Gothic "royal peculiar" (a church directly under the jurisdiction of the monarch) located in London, UK. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most significant religious and historical buildings in the world. Officially known as the Collegiate Church of St. Peter at Westminster, it has been a central part of British history for over 1,000 years.

### Key Historical Facts
- **Coronations and Royal Events**: It has hosted every English and British coronation since William the Conqueror in 1066, right up to Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 (and King Charles III in 2023). It's also the site of 17 royal weddings, including the high-profile marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.
- **Burials and Memorials**: The abbey is the final resting place for many royals, nobles, and notable figures. This includes:
  - Tudor siblings Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Mary I (who were rivals in life).
  - Writers like Geoffrey Chaucer, Rudyard Kipling, and Charles Dickens.
  - Scientists such as Isaac Newton, Stephen Hawking, and Charles Darwin.
  - Abolitionists, actors, and even the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (a memorial to unidentified soldiers from World War I).
- **Architectural Highlights**:
  - The 700-year-old Coronation Chair, used in every coronation ceremony.
  - Stunning 16th-century stonework and portraits of modern martyrs.
  - The grand Henry VII Lady Chapel, an ornate example of late Perpendicular Gothic architecture.
  - The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries: Located 52 feet (about 16 meters) up among the flying buttresses and carved gargoyles, this 13th-century triforium (a hidden gallery) was concealed for centuries and now displays artifacts revealing the abbey's secrets.

### Visiting Information
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair accessible, with service animals allowed. Public transportation is nearby, but it's not recommended for those with spinal injuries or poor cardiovascular health. It's suitable for most fitness levels.
- **Practical Tips**: Bring your ticket to the attraction (if visiting). Note that operators may cancel tours for unforeseen reasons, and you need to be 18+ to book independently or be accompanied by an adult.
- **What's Typically Included in a Visit** (based on guided tour options): Entry reservations, expert-guided exploration of the abbey's history and features.
- **Not Included**: Gratuities, food/drinks, or hotel transfers.
- **Cancellation**: Many guided experiences offer free cancellation.

If you're planning a trip, private guided tours are a popular way to explore (starting around $565 USD for a group, based on current listings), but you can also visit independently. The abbey is open to the public for worship, tours, and events—check the official website for hours, as they vary.

If this isn't quite what you meant (e.g., you want ticket prices, opening hours, or info on a specific aspect like events or architecture), or if you'd like me to book something or search for nearby attractions/hotels, just let me know! 😊
