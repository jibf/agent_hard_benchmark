2025-08-13 22:54:22,108 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-26 - INFO - Final Response: The Forbidden City (also known as the Palace Museum) is a massive imperial palace complex in Beijing, China, and a UNESCO World Heritage site. It served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households from the Ming Dynasty (starting in 1420) through the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. Spanning over 720,000 square meters, it's one of the largest and best-preserved ancient wooden structures in the world, featuring nearly 1,000 buildings and over 8,700 rooms. It's famous for its stunning architecture, intricate designs, and historical significance as the political and ceremonial center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.

### Key Highlights:
- **Location**: Central Beijing, China.
- **Best Time to Visit**: Morning or afternoon; aim for weekdays to avoid crowds.
- **What to Expect**: You can explore at your own pace, admiring halls, gardens, artifacts, and exhibits. It's not wheelchair accessible and may not be suitable for those with mobility issues, spinal injuries, poor cardiovascular health, or pregnant travelers. Public transportation is nearby.
- **Ticket Info**: Entrance tickets cost around $9.90 USD (pre-booking recommended to skip long lines—show your passport for entry). Note that this typically covers the main Forbidden City but not additional areas like the Clock Museum, Jewelry Museum, or Meridian Gate. Tickets are not accessible with a Chinese ID or passport.
- **What's Not Included in Basic Tickets**: Tour guide services, transportation, or entry to special exhibits.
- **Visitor Tips**: Bring your passport, wear comfortable shoes (lots of walking), and check for any closures. Free cancellation is often available if booking through services like Viator or Booking.com.
- **Reviews**: Based on 42 recent visitor ratings, it scores an average of 4.9/5. People love the historical grandeur but note it can be crowded and challenging without a guide.

If you're planning a visit, it's operated by services like Authentic China Tours for ticket bookings. For more specifics (e.g., history, maps, or guided tours), let me know—I can dig deeper or suggest resources! Have you been to Beijing before?
