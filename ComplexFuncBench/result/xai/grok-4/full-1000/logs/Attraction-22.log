2025-08-13 22:54:04,067 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-22 - INFO - Final Response: Hey! The Etihad Stadium you mentioned is indeed pretty dopeâ€”it's the iconic home ground of Manchester City Football Club in Manchester, England. I pulled up some detailed info based on what's available, focusing on a popular guided tour experience that gives a deep dive into the stadium. If this isn't the one you meant (there's also a stadium formerly known as Etihad in Melbourne, Australia, now called Marvel Stadium), let me know for a refine!

### Quick Overview
- **Location**: Manchester, UK (Etihad Campus, Ashton New Rd, Manchester M11 3FF).
- **Capacity**: 53,400 seatsâ€”it's a massive, state-of-the-art venue in the Premier League.
- **Home Team**: Manchester City FC (aka Man City), one of the top clubs in world football with a rich history of titles and star players like Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland.
- **Fun Fact**: Opened in 2002 (originally as the City of Manchester Stadium for the Commonwealth Games), it got its Etihad naming rights from the airline sponsor in 2011. It's known for its electric atmosphere during matches and cutting-edge features.

### Guided Tour Details (Highly Recommended if You're Visiting)
If you're into checking it out in person, there's a popular **75-minute Etihad Stadium Guided Tour** that's a great way to explore behind the scenes. Here's the scoop:

- **What You'll Experience**:
  - Walk through the famous players' tunnel onto the pitchâ€”feel that match-day buzz!
  - Visit the press conference room, home and away dressing rooms, and the dugouts.
  - Learn about the club's history, achievements (like multiple Premier League wins), and fun anecdotes from a knowledgeable guide.
  - Check out modern facilities like an exhibition space with holographic content and a 360-degree cinema suite for immersive highlights.

- **Duration**: 75 minutes.
- **Price**: Starts at about $39 USD per person (varies by date and group size; this is for adults).
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair accessible, so it's inclusive.
- **Requirements/Restrictions**:
  - Arrive at least 20 minutes early.
  - You need to be 18+ to book, or accompanied by an adult.
  - Bring your ticket (digital is fine).
- **Cancellation**: Free cancellation availableâ€”super flexible if plans change.
- **Operated By**: Klook (a trusted booking platform).
- **Reviews**: It's rated 5/5 based on initial feedbackâ€”people love the insider access and energy.

This tour is bookable online, and it's a solid way to get that "dope" vibe up close without needing match tickets (which can be pricey and hard to snag). If you're planning a trip, I can help search flights to Manchester or look up more attractions nearby. What specifically caught your eye on social mediaâ€”any cool videos or features? ðŸ˜Ž
