2025-08-13 23:00:35,407 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-65 - INFO - Final Response: Based on your interest in Hamilton-themed attractions in New York (which I assume refers to the hit musical based on Alexander Hamilton's life), I found several relevant options—mostly historical walking tours focused on Hamilton's life and legacy in the city. These tie directly into the themes of the musical.

I checked them in the order they appeared in my search. The first one is already under $45, so here's the info on it:

### New York: The Story of Alexander Hamilton In Lower Manhattan
- **Description**: This is a guided walking tour (about 1.5 miles) through Lower Manhattan, retracing Alexander Hamilton's footsteps. You'll visit sites like Wall Street, the Stock Exchange, Trinity Church (where Hamilton is buried), and Fraunces Tavern (where you can optionally grab a drink afterward). It covers how Hamilton helped shape New York's financial system and includes stories from his life. The tour is small-group (max 16 people), child-friendly (kids under 6 are free), and suitable for all ages/fitness levels. It runs rain or shine.
- **Price**: $40.78 USD per person (representative price; may vary slightly by date/booking).
- **Duration**: Approximately 2 hours.
- **What's Included**: Local English-speaking guide, visits to 10 key Hamilton-related stops, and tips for other things to do in NYC.
- **Not Included**: Gratuities, food/drinks.
- **Cancellation**: Free cancellation available.
- **Booking/Info**: You can book this through platforms like Booking.com or Viator. Search for "Alexander Hamilton Tour Lower Manhattan" to find availability.

If this doesn't quite fit (e.g., if you're looking for something more directly tied to the musical itself, like Broadway tickets), or if you'd like details on the other options I found (some of which are pricier private tours), let me know! For reference, Broadway tickets to the actual *Hamilton* musical typically start around $100+ per person, but they're not listed as "attractions" in the system I checked.
