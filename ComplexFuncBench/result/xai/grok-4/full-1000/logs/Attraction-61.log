2025-08-13 23:00:10,734 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-61 - INFO - Final Response: Based on your query for Opera-themed attractions or activities in Rome (which I interpreted as relating to opera music/performances, given the available options), I searched and found several relevant options. The first one I checked was over $100, but the next one fits under that budget. Here's what I found:

### Recommended Option: Opera Concert Ticket in Rome with Dinner
- **Description**: This includes a ticket to an opera concert presented by incredible tenor and soprano soloists accompanied by grand piano, held in the historic Waldensian Church in the heart of Rome. It's performed by the Opera da Camera di Roma ensemble (which has received TripAdvisor's Travelers' Choice award). After the concert, you'll enjoy a traditional Italian dinner at the cozy family-run restaurant Enoteca Corsi.
- **Price**: $86.62 USD per person (includes concert ticket in VIP sector and dinner).
- **Duration/Details**: The concert is about 1 hour, with dinner following. It's suitable for all ages (infants and children are allowed, with options for prams/strollers), but note that it's not wheelchair accessible.
- **What's Included**: Concert ticket, VIP seating, and dinner (with water and wine).
- **Cancellation**: Free cancellation available.
- **Reviews**: Rated 3.9/5 based on 17 reviews (one recent review praised the music and dinner but noted the venue felt dated and the restaurant was a bit hard to find).
- **Booking Note**: This is bookable online, and public transportation is nearby.

If this doesn't quite match what you meant by "Opera series" (or if you'd like me to check flights/hotels to Rome, more options, or clarify anything), just let me know!
