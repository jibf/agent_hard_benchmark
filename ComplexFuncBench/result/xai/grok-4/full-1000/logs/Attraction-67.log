2025-08-13 23:01:13,436 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-67 - INFO - Final Response: Based on your interest in Titanic-themed attractions and activities in Belfast, I found several relevant options. Following your instructions, I checked them in the order of search relevance. The first one (a full-day tour that includes Titanic Belfast but starts from Dublin) costs $95.29 USD per person, which is over $50. So I moved to the next one, which is under $50. Here's what I found:

### Recommended Option: Titanic Belfast Admission Ticket
- **Description**: This is the main Titanic-themed attraction in Belfast—a museum and visitor experience detailing the history of the Titanic (built in Belfast), with interactive exhibits, audiovisual presentations, a shipyard ride, and access to the SS Nomadic (the last remaining White Star Line vessel). It's highly rated (4.6/5 from hundreds of reviews) and perfect for fans of the Titanic story.
- **Location**: Belfast, Northern Ireland (right at the Titanic Quarter).
- **Price**: $32.43 USD per person (representative price; child tickets may be cheaper—around $15–20 USD equivalent for kids, based on typical pricing).
- **Duration**: Self-guided; allow 1.5–2 hours.
- **Other Details**: Open daily (check exact times), wheelchair accessible, and includes free cancellation. Audio guides are extra if desired.
- **Booking Note**: Tickets are timed-entry, so book in advance to avoid peak-hour waits.

If this doesn't suit (e.g., you want a guided tour instead of a self-guided museum), let me know and I can check further options or details!
