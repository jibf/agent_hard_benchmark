## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

The data lakehouse is designed as a unified, simple architecture to handle all your data, analytics, and AI use cases. It eliminates the data silos that organizations typically have, providing a single home for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. This enables you to use a variety of analytics and machine learning engines directly on the data without needing to move it to a separate system.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized, sociotechnical approach to share, access and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments - within or across organizations.

A data mesh supports distributed, domain-specific data consumers and views data as a product, with each domain handling its own data pipelines. The four principles of data mesh are:

- Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture
- Data as a product
- Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform
- Federated computational governance

## 1.5. What is a Data Fabric?

A data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. It is a powerful architecture that standardizes data management practices and practicalities across cloud, on premises, and edge devices.

Data fabric leverages both human and machine capabilities to access data in place or support its consolidation where appropriate. It continuously identifies and connects data from disparate applications to discover unique, business-relevant relationships between the available data points. The insight supports re-engineered decision-making, providing more value through rapid access and comprehension than traditional data management.

## 1.6. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository. Data pipelines ingest, process, prepare, transform and enrich structured, unstructured and semi-structured data in a governed manner; this is also called data integration.

Data pipelines consist of three key elements: a source, a processing step or steps, and a destination. In some data pipelines, the destination may be called a sink. Data pipelines enable the flow of data from an application to a data warehouse, from a data lake to an analytics database, or into a payment processing system, for example. Data pipelines also may have the same source and sink, such that the pipeline is purely about modifying the data set. Any time data is processed between points, it’s a data pipeline.

Data pipelines may be simple or complex, but they all have the same goal: data movement. Data pipelines are used to perform data integration. Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This process includes steps such as data ingestion, transformation, and loading. Data integration is a key component of data pipelines.

## 1.7. What is ETL?

ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

As the databases grew in popularity in the 1970s, ETL was introduced as a process for integrating and loading data for computation and analysis, eventually becoming the primary method to process data for data warehousing projects.

ETL provides the foundation for data analytics and machine learning workstreams. Through a series of business rules, ETL cleanses and organizes data in a way which addresses specific business intelligence needs, like monthly reporting, but it can also tackle more advanced analytics, which can improve back-end processes or end user experiences. ETL is often used by an organization to:

- Extract data from legacy systems
- Cleanse the data to improve data quality and establish consistency
- Load data into a target database

## 1.8. What is ELT?

ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is a data integration process for transferring raw data from a source server to a data system (such as a data warehouse or data lake) on a target server and then preparing the information for downstream uses.

ELT is a variant of ETL wherein the data is transformed after it is loaded into the data warehouse. This allows for faster loading times, but requires more processing power and storage space in the data warehouse. ELT is particularly useful for big data scenarios where the data is too large to transform before loading.

## 1.9. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This process includes steps such as data ingestion, transformation, and loading. Data integration is a key component of data pipelines.

Data integration enables analytics tools to produce effective, actionable business intelligence. Data integration is a core component of the overall data management process that helps to produce a unified view of data from disparate sources.

## 1.10. What is Data Ingestion?

Data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. Data ingestion is the first step in the data pipeline. Data ingestion can be performed in real-time or in batches.

Data ingestion is the process of moving data from a source to a target. The source can be a database, a file, a stream, or an application. The target can be a data warehouse, a data lake, or a data mart. Data ingestion is a key component of data integration.

## 1.11. What is Data Transformation?

Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure. Data transformation is a key component of data integration and data management. Data transformation can be simple or complex, and can be performed in a variety of ways, including:

- Data cleansing: The process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database.
- Data enrichment: The process of enhancing, refining, or improving raw data.
- Data aggregation: The process of gathering and expressing data in a summary form.
- Data normalization: The process of organizing data in a database.
- Data validation: The process of ensuring that data is correct and useful.

## 1.12. What is Data Loading?

Data loading is the process of moving data from a source to a target. The source can be a database, a file, a stream, or an application. The target can be a data warehouse, a data lake, or a data mart. Data loading is a key component of data integration.
