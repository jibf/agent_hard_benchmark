## 1.1. What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data structures as:

- Mathematical/Logical models or abstract data types
- Implementation

## 1.2. Data Structure Operations

- Traversing
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sorting
- Merging

## 1.3. Why do we need Data Structures?

- As applications are getting complex and amount of data is increasing day by day, there may arise the following problems:
  - Processor speed: To handle very large amount of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity, processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.
  - Data Search: Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time, results in slowing down the search process.
  - Multiple requests: If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed during that process

in order to solve the above problems, data structures are used. Data is organized to form a data structure in such a way that all items are not required to be searched and required data can be searched instantly.

## 1.4. Advantages of Data Structures

- Efficiency: Efficiency of a program depends upon the choice of data structures. For example: suppose, we have some data and we need to perform the search for a particular record. In that case, if we organize our data in an array, we will have to search sequentially element by element. hence, using array may not be very efficient here. There are better data structures which can make the search process efficient like ordered array, binary search tree or hash tables.
- Reusability: Data structures are reusable, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place. Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients.
- Abstraction: Data structure is specified by the ADT which provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure through interface only, without getting into the implementation details.

## 1.5. Execution Time Cases

There are three cases which are usually used to compare various data structure's execution time in a relative manner.

- Worst Case: This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is ƒ(n) then this operation will not take more than ƒ(n) time where ƒ(n) represents function of n.
- Average Case: This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then m operations will take mƒ(n) time.
- Best Case: This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which would be maximum as ƒ(n).

## 1.6. Basic Terminology

- Data: Data are values or set of values.
- Data Item: Data item refers to single unit of values.
- Group Items: Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.
- Elementary Items: Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.
- Attribute and Entity: An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.
- Entity Set: Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.
- Field: Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.
- Record: Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.
- File: File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.

# 2. Algorithm Analysis

## 2.1. What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.

## 2.2. Characteristics of an Algorithm

- Unambiguous: Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.
- Input: An algorithm should have 0 or more well defined inputs.
- Output: An algorithm should have 1 or more well defined outputs, and should match the desired output.
- Finiteness: Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- Feasibility: Should be feasible with the available resources.
- Independent: An algorithm should have step-by-step directions which should be independent of any programming code.

## 2.3. How to Write an Algorithm?

There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.

As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.

We write algorithms in step by step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.

## 2.4. Algorithm Analysis

Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following:

- A Priori Analysis: This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.
- A Posteriori Analysis: This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.

We shall learn about a priori algorithm analysis. Algorithm analysis deals with the execution or running time of various operations involved. The running time of an operation can be defined as the number of computer instructions executed per operation.

## 2.5. Algorithm Complexity

Suppose X is an algorithm and n is the size of input data, the time and space used by the algorithm X are the two main factors, which decide the efficiency of X.

- Time Factor: Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.
- Space Factor: Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.

The complexity of an algorithm f(n) gives the running time and/or the storage space required by the algorithm in terms of n as the size of input data.

## 2.6. Space Complexity

Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components:

- A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc.
- A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc.

Space complexity S(P) of any algorithm P is S(P) = C + SP(I), where C is the fixed part and S(I) is the variable part of the algorithm, which depends on instance characteristic I.

Following is a simple example that tries to explain the concept:

```c
Algorithm: SUM(A, B)
Step 1 -  START
Step 2 -  C ← A + B + 10
Step 3 -  Stop
```

Here we have three variables A, B, and C and one constant. Hence S(P) = 1+3. Now, space depends on data types of given variables and constant types and it will be multiplied accordingly.

## 2.7. Time Complexity

Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time.

For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c \* n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.

# 3. Asymptotic Analysis

Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

Asymptotic analysis is input bound i.e., if there's no input to the algorithm, it is concluded to work in a constant time. Other than the "input" all other factors are considered constant.

Asymptotic analysis refers to computing the running time of any operation in mathematical units of computation. For example, the running time of one operation is computed as f(n) and may be for another operation it is computed as g(n2). This means the first operation running time will increase linearly with the increase in n and the running time of the second operation will increase exponentially when n increases. Similarly, the running time of both operations will be nearly the same if n is significantly small.

Usually, the time required by an algorithm falls under three types:

- Best Case: Minimum time required for program execution.
- Average Case: Average time required for program execution.
- Worst Case: Maximum time required for program execution.

## 3.1. Asymptotic Notations

Following are the commonly used asymptotic notations to calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm.

- Ο Notation
- Ω Notation
- θ Notation

### 3.1.1. Big Oh Notation, Ο

The notation Ο(n) is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

For example, for a function f(n)

Ο(f(n)) = { g(n) : there exists c > 0 and n0 such that f(n) ≤ c.g(n) for all n > n0. }

### 3.1.2. Omega Notation, Ω

The notation Ω(n) is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

For example, for a function f(n)

Ω(f(n)) ≥ { g(n) : there exists c > 0 and n0 such that g(n) ≤ c.f(n) for all n > n0. }

### 3.1.3. Theta Notation, θ

The notation θ(n) is the formal way to express both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It is represented as follows:

θ(f(n)) = { g(n) if and only if g(n) =  Ο(f(n)) and g(n) = Ω(f(n)) for all n > n0. }

## 3.2. Common Asymptotic Notations

| constant    | −       | Ο(1)      |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| logarithmic | −       | Ο(log n)  |
| linear      | −       | Ο(n)      |
| n log n     | −       | Ο(n log n)|
| quadratic   | −       | Ο(n2)     |
| cubic       | −       | Ο(n3)     |
| polynomial  | −       | nΟ(1)     |
| exponential | −       | 2Ο(n)     |

# 4. Greedy Algorithms

## 4.1. Overview

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

For example, a greedy strategy for the traveling salesman problem (which is of a high computational complexity) is the following heuristic: "At each stage visit an unvisited city nearest to the current city". This heuristic need not find a best solution, but terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution typically requires unreasonably many steps.

In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms solve combinatorial problems having the properties of matroids.

## 4.2. Components of Greedy Algorithm

Greedy algorithms have the following five components:

- A candidate set: A solution is created from this set.
- A selection function: Used to choose the best candidate to be added to the solution.
- A feasibility function: Used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to the solution.
- An objective function: Used to assign a value to a solution or a partial solution.
- A solution function: Used to indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.

## 4.3. Areas of Application

Greedy approach is used to solve many problems, such as

- Finding the shortest path between two vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Finding the minimal spanning tree in a graph using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
- Finding the minimal spanning tree in a graph using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
- and many more...

## 4.4. Examples

Most networking algorithms use the greedy approach. Here is a list of few of them:

- Travelling Salesman Problem
- Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Graph - Map Coloring
- Graph - Vertex Cover
- Knapsack Problem
- Job Scheduling Problem

There are lots of similar problems that uses the greedy approach to find an optimum solution.

# 5. Divide and Conquer

## 5.1. Overview

In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem.

Broadly, we can understand divide-and-conquer approach in a three-step process.

### 5.1.1. Divide/Break

This step involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. Sub-problems should represent a part of the original problem. This step generally takes a recursive approach to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. At this stage, sub-problems become atomic in nature but still represent some part of the actual problem.

### 5.1.2. Conquer/Solve

This step receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. Generally, at this level, the problems are considered 'solved' on their own.

### 5.1.3. Merge/Combine

When the smaller sub-problems are solved, this stage recursively combines them until they formulate a solution of the original problem. This algorithmic approach works recursively and conquer & merge steps works so close that they appear as one.

## 5.2. Examples

The following computer algorithms are based on divide-and-conquer programming approach:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Closest pair (points)

There are various ways available to solve any computer problem, but the mentioned are a good example of divide and conquer approach.

# 6. Dynamic Programming

## 6.1. Overview

Dynamic programming approach is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently. Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.

Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used. Mostly, these algorithms are used for optimization. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub-problems. The solutions of sub-problems are combined in order to achieve the best solution.

So we can say that:

- The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problem.
- An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems.
- Dynamic algorithms use Memoization.

## 6.2. Comparison

In contrast to greedy algorithms, where local optimization is addressed, dynamic algorithms are motivated for an overall optimization of the problem.

In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, where solutions are combined to achieve an overall solution, dynamic algorithms use the output of a smaller sub-problem and then try to optimize a bigger sub-problem. Dynamic algorithms use Memoization to remember the output of already solved sub-problems.

## 6.3. Example

The following computer problems can be solved using dynamic programming approach:

- Fibonacci number series
- Knapsack problem
- Tower of Hanoi
- All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
- Shortest path by Dijkstra
- Project scheduling

Dynamic programming can be used in both top-down and bottom-up manner. And of course, most of the times, referring to the previous solution output is cheaper than recomputing in terms of CPU cycles.

# 7. Array Data Structure

## 7.1. What is an Array?

An array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

- Element: Each item stored in an array is called an element.
- Index: Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.

## 7.2. Array Representation

Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.

Arrays can be declared in various ways in different languages. For illustration, let's take C array declaration.

As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.

- Index starts with 0.
- Array length is 10 which means it can store 10 elements.
- Each element can be accessed via its index. For example, we can fetch an element at index 6 as 9.

## 7.3. Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations supported by an array.

- Traverse: print all the array elements one by one.
- Insertion: Adds an element at the given index.
- Deletion: Deletes an element at the given index.
- Search: Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
- Update: Updates an element at the given index.

In C, when an array is initialized with size, then it assigns defaults values to its elements in following order.

| Data Type | Default Value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| bool      | false         |
| char      | 0             |
| int       | 0             |
| float     | 0.0           |
