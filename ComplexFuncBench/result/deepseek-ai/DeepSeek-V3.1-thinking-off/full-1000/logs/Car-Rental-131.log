## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

The data lakehouse is designed as a single, unified platform that can serve the needs of both data warehousing and data science. It is built on top of open formats like Parquet and ORC, and it uses a metadata layer to provide ACID transactions, data versioning, and schema enforcement.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized, domain-oriented data architecture that organizes data by business domain. It is a paradigm shift from the traditional, centralized data architecture to a distributed, domain-driven data architecture.

The data mesh is designed to address the challenges of scaling data and analytics in large organizations. It is built on four principles:

- Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture
- Data as a product
- Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform
- Federated computational governance

## 1.5. What is a Data Fabric?

A data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. It is designed to help organizations manage their data across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

The data fabric is built on six key capabilities:

- Data discovery
- Data ingestion
- Data preparation
- Data orchestration
- Data governance
- Data security

## 1.6. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion.
