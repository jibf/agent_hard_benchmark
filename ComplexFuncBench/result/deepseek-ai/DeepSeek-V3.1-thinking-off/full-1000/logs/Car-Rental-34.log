## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

A data warehouse may contain multiple databases. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns. Within each column, you can define a description of the data, such as integer, data field, or string. Tables can be organized inside of schemas, which you can think of as folders. When you query a data warehouse, it combines data from multiple tables to arrive at the answer.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

Data lakes are becoming increasingly important as people, especially in business and technology, want to perform broad data exploration and discovery. They need to quickly and easily get all their data, of all types, in one central place, so they can do new types of analytics like machine learning over new data sources like log files, data from click-streams, social media, and internet connected devices stored in the data lake. They also want to analyze this data in place, without moving it to a separate analytics system.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

The data lakehouse is designed as a unified data management architecture that allows organizations to store, manage, and analyze structured and unstructured data in a single repository. It combines the best of both data lakes and data warehouses, providing the scalability and cost-effectiveness of data lakes with the performance and reliability of data warehouses.

The data lakehouse architecture is built on top of open formats such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC, and it uses open table formats such as Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Delta Lake to provide ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution. It also supports a variety of data processing engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Presto, allowing users to run both batch and streaming workloads on the same data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized, sociotechnical approach to share, access, and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments—within or across organizations. It is a new paradigm that shifts the focus from a centralized data platform to a distributed data architecture, where data is treated as a product and owned by the teams that generate it.

The data mesh architecture is based on four core principles:

- Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture: Data is owned by the business domains that generate it, and each domain is responsible for providing its data as a product to the rest of the organization.
- Data as a product: Data is treated as a product, and data owners are responsible for ensuring that their data is discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, and self-describing.
- Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform: A self-serve data platform provides the necessary tools and infrastructure to enable domains to easily publish, discover, and consume data products.
- Federated computational governance: A federated governance model ensures that data products comply with global policies and standards, while allowing domains to have autonomy over their data.

The data mesh architecture is designed to address the challenges of scaling data platforms in large organizations, where centralized data teams become bottlenecks and data quality issues arise due to the lack of domain knowledge. By decentralizing data ownership and treating data as a product, data mesh enables organizations to scale their data platforms and improve data quality and agility.

## 1.5. What is a Data Fabric?

A data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning hybrid multicloud environments. It is a unified data management framework that enables seamless data access and sharing across disparate data sources and environments.

The data fabric architecture is designed to provide a consistent and unified view of data across the organization, regardless of where the data is stored or how it is structured. It uses metadata to automatically discover, understand, and connect data from various sources, and it provides data virtualization capabilities to allow users to query and analyze data without having to move or copy it.

Key components of a data fabric include:

- Data catalog: A centralized repository of metadata that provides a unified view of all data assets across the organization.
- Data virtualization: A technology that allows users to query and analyze data from multiple sources without having to move or copy the data.
- Data integration: Tools and services for ingesting, transforming, and moving data between different systems and environments.
- Data governance: Policies, processes, and tools for ensuring data quality, security, and compliance across the organization.
- Data orchestration: Automation of data pipelines and workflows to ensure that data is processed and delivered in a timely and efficient manner.

The data fabric architecture is designed to address the challenges of data silos, data complexity, and data governance in hybrid multicloud environments. By providing a unified and consistent data management framework, data fabric enables organizations to improve data accessibility, agility, and trust.

## 1.6. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a data pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. A data pipeline can be used to process data in real-time or in batch mode.

Data pipelines are used to move data from one system to another, and to transform data along the way. They are a key component of data engineering and are used to build data warehouses, data lakes, and other data systems. Data pipelines can be built using a variety of tools and technologies, including ETL (extract, transform, load) tools, data integration platforms, and custom code.

A typical data pipeline consists of the following stages:

- Data ingestion: The process of collecting data from various sources and bringing it into the data pipeline.
- Data processing: The process of transforming, enriching, and cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Data storage: The process of storing the processed data in a data warehouse, data lake, or other storage system.
- Data consumption: The process of making the data available to end users through reports, dashboards, and other analytics tools.

Data pipelines can be simple or complex, depending on the volume, variety, and velocity of the data being processed. They can be built using a variety of architectures, including batch processing, stream processing, and lambda architecture.

## 1.7. What is ETL?

ETL stands for extract, transform, load. It is a process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it to fit operational needs, and loading it into a data warehouse or other target system.

The ETL process is a key component of data integration and is used to build data warehouses, data lakes, and other data systems. It is typically performed using ETL tools or custom code, and it can be run on a scheduled basis or in real-time.

The ETL process consists of the following steps:

- Extract: Data is extracted from various sources, such as databases, files, APIs, and streaming platforms.
- Transform: Data is transformed to fit the target system's schema and quality standards. This may involve cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and enriching the data.
- Load: The transformed data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake.

ETL is often used in conjunction with data pipelines to move and process data between systems. It is a critical process for ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and available for analysis.

## 1.8. What is ELT?

ELT stands for extract, load, transform. It is a variation of the ETL process where data is extracted from various sources, loaded into a target system, and then transformed within the target system.

The ELT process is becoming increasingly popular with the rise of cloud data warehouses and data lakes, which have the compute power to perform transformations at scale. ELT allows organizations to load raw data into their target system and then transform it as needed, which can be more flexible and efficient than traditional ETL.

The ELT process consists of the following steps:

- Extract: Data is extracted from various sources, such as databases, files, APIs, and streaming platforms.
- Load: The raw data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake.
- Transform: Data is transformed within the target system to fit the desired schema and quality standards.

ELT is often used in modern data architectures, where the target system has the capability to perform complex transformations on large volumes of data. It is particularly well-suited for data lakes and data lakehouses, where data is stored in its raw form and transformed on-demand for analysis.

## 1.9. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization. It involves defining policies, procedures, and standards for data management, and ensuring that these are followed across the organization.

Data governance is a critical component of data management and is essential for ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. It helps organizations to improve data quality, reduce risks, and comply with regulations.

Key aspects of data governance include:
