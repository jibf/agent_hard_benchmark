## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

A data warehouse may contain multiple databases. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns. Within each column, you can define a description of the data, such as integer, data field, or string. Tables can be organized inside of schemas, which you can think of as folders. When you query a data warehouse, it combines data from multiple tables to arrive at the answer.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it, ignoring size limits.

Data lakes have emerged as a popular way to store and analyze data because they allow companies to manage multiple data types from a wide variety of sources, and store this data, structured and unstructured, at a low cost. Storing data in a data lake is popular because raw data can be stored in its original format, which allows companies to add structure as needed for analytics and data science use cases.

Data lakes are often compared to data warehouses, but they are not the same. A data warehouse is a database optimized to analyze relational data coming from transactional systems and line of business applications. The data structure, and schema are defined in advance to optimize for fast SQL queries, where the results are typically used for operational reporting and analysis. Data is cleaned, enriched, and transformed so it can act as the âsingle source of truthâ that users can trust.

A data lake is different because it stores relational data from line of business applications, and non-relational data from mobile apps, IoT devices, and social media. The structure of the data or schema is not defined when data is captured. This means you can store all of your data without careful design or the need to know what questions you might need answers for in the future. Different types of analytics on your data like SQL queries, big data analytics, full text search, real-time analytics, and machine learning can be used to uncover insights.

As organizations with data warehouses see the benefits of data lakes, they are evolving their warehouse to include data lakes, and enabling diverse query capabilities, data science use-cases, and advanced capabilities for discovering new information models. This has lead to the term âlakehouse architectureâ.

## 1.3. What is a Lakehouse?

A lakehouse is a new, open architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses. Lakehouses are enabled by a new system design: implementing similar data structures and data management features to those in a data warehouse directly on top of low cost cloud storage in open formats. They are what you would get if you had to redesign data warehouses in the modern world, now that cheap and highly reliable storage (in the form of object stores) are available.

A lakehouse has the following key features:

- Transaction support: In an enterprise lakehouse many data pipelines will often be reading and writing data concurrently. Support for ACID transactions ensures consistency as multiple parties concurrently read or write data, typically using SQL.
- Schema enforcement and governance: The lakehouse should have a way to support schema enforcement and evolution, supporting DW schema architectures such as star/snowflake-schemas. The system should be able to reason about data integrity, and it should have robust governance and auditing mechanisms.
- BI support: Lakehouses enable using BI tools directly on the source data. This reduces staleness and improves recency, reduces latency, and lowers the cost of having to operationalize two copies of the data in both a data lake and a warehouse.
- Storage is decoupled from compute: In practice this means that storage and compute use separate clusters, thus these systems are able to scale to many more concurrent users and larger data sizes. Some modern data warehouses also have this property.
- Openness: The storage formats used are open and standardized, such as Parquet, and they provide an API so a variety of tools and engines, including machine learning and Python/R libraries, can efficiently access the data directly.
- Support for diverse data types ranging from unstructured to structured data: The lakehouse can be used to store, refine, analyze, and access data types needed for many new data applications, including images, video, audio, semi-structured data, and text.
- Support for diverse workloads: including data science, machine learning, and SQL and analytics. Multiple tools might be needed to support all these workloads, but they all rely on the same data repository.
- End-to-end streaming: Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises. Support for streaming eliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to serving real-time data applications.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

Organizations create data marts to provide users with data that is most relevant to them in an easy-to-use manner. This approach can help improve user adoption and engagement with the data, as well as improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed for each query.

Data marts can be structured in a variety of ways, including:

- Dependent data marts: These are built from an existing data warehouse. They are essentially views or subsets of the data warehouse.
- Independent data marts: These are built without a data warehouse. They are standalone systems that are created to serve a specific business need.
- Hybrid data marts: These combine data from an existing data warehouse and other operational systems.

Data marts are typically smaller and more focused than data warehouses, and they are often used to provide department-specific or function-specific data to business users.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository. Data pipelines are used to ingest data from various sources, transform it into a usable format, and then load it into a destination system such as a data warehouse, data lake, or data mart.

Data pipelines typically consist of the following components:

- Data ingestion: The process of collecting data from various sources, such as databases, applications, files, and streaming sources.
- Data transformation: The process of cleaning, enriching, and transforming the data into a format that is suitable for analysis.
- Data loading: The process of loading the transformed data into a target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake.
- Data orchestration: The process of coordinating and managing the execution of the data pipeline, including scheduling, monitoring, and error handling.

Data pipelines can be built using a variety of tools and technologies, including ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools, data integration platforms, and custom scripts. They can be batch-oriented, processing data in scheduled intervals, or real-time, processing data as it arrives.

Data pipelines are essential for ensuring that data is available, accurate, and timely for analysis and decision making. They help organizations automate the process of data collection, transformation, and loading, reducing manual effort and improving data quality.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used to extract data from various sources, transform it into a format that is suitable for analysis, and then load it into a target system such as a data warehouse or data mart.

The ETL process typically consists of the following steps:

- Extract: Data is extracted from various source systems, such as databases, applications, files, and streaming sources. The data may be in different formats and structures.
- Transform: The extracted data is transformed into a format that is suitable for analysis. This may involve cleaning the data, removing duplicates, enriching it with additional information, and converting it into a common format.
- Load: The transformed data is loaded into a target system, such as a data warehouse or data mart. The data may be loaded in bulk or incrementally, depending on the requirements.

ETL processes are typically batch-oriented, meaning they run on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, hourly) to process data in batches. However, with the rise of real-time data processing, there is also a growing interest in real-time ETL or stream processing.

ETL tools and platforms provide a way to automate and manage the ETL process, including data extraction, transformation, and loading. They often include features for data quality, data lineage, and monitoring.

ETL is a critical component of data warehousing and data integration, as it ensures that data is available, accurate, and timely for analysis and decision making.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. It is a variation of the ETL process where data is first extracted from source systems, loaded into a target system (such as a data warehouse or data lake), and then transformed within the target system.

The ELT process typically consists of the following steps:

- Extract: Data is extracted from various source systems, such as databases, applications, files, and streaming sources.
- Load: The extracted data is loaded into a target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake, without any transformation. The data is stored in its raw format.
- Transform: The data is transformed within the target system using the processing power of the target system. This may involve cleaning the data, removing duplicates, enriching it with additional information, and converting it into a format suitable for analysis.

ELT has become popular with the rise of cloud data warehouses and data lakes, which offer scalable and powerful processing capabilities. By loading data first and then transforming it within the target system, organizations can take advantage of the processing power of the target system and avoid the need for separate transformation tools.

ELT is particularly well-suited for handling large volumes of data and for scenarios where the transformation logic may change frequently. It also allows for greater flexibility in how data is transformed and analyzed.

However, ELT may require more storage space in the target system, as raw data is stored alongside transformed data. It may also require more processing power within the target system to perform the transformations.

## 1.8. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of data structures, relationships, and constraints within a system. It involves defining how data is organized, stored, and accessed in a database or data warehouse.

Data modeling is an important step in the design of data warehouses, data lakes, and other data systems. It helps ensure that data is structured in a way that supports the business requirements for reporting, analysis, and decision making.

There are several types of data models, including:

- Conceptual data model: A high-level model that describes the main entities and relationships in the system. It is used to communicate with business stakeholders and to define the scope of the system.
- Logical data model: A detailed model that describes the entities, attributes, and relationships in the system. It is independent of any specific database technology and is used to define the structure of the data.
- Physical data model: A model that describes how the data will be stored in a specific database technology. It includes details such as data types, indexes, and partitions.

Data modeling is typically done using specialized tools that allow data architects and designers to create visual representations of the data structures. These tools often include features for generating SQL scripts to create database tables, and for reverse-engineering existing databases.

Data modeling is a critical part of data warehouse design, as it helps ensure that the data warehouse is structured in a way that supports efficient querying and analysis. Common data modeling techniques for data warehouses include star schema and snowflake schema.

## 1.9. What is a Star Schema?

A star schema is a type of data model used in data warehousing. It is called a star schema because the diagram of the schema resembles a star, with a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.

The star schema consists of two types of tables:

- Fact tables: These tables contain the measurable, quantitative data about a business process. For example, a fact table might contain sales data, with columns for sales amount, quantity, and date.
- Dimension tables: These tables contain descriptive attributes that provide context for the facts. For example, a dimension table might contain information about products, customers, or time.

In a star schema, each dimension table is directly related to the fact table through a foreign key relationship. This structure makes it easy to query the data, as users can join the fact table with the dimension tables to get the desired information.

The star schema is denormalized, meaning that dimension tables may contain redundant data. This denormalization improves query performance by reducing the number of joins required to retrieve data.

Star schemas are widely used in data warehousing because they are simple to understand and provide good performance for analytical queries. They are particularly well-suited for business intelligence and reporting applications.

## 1.10. What is a Snowflake Schema?

A snowflake schema is a type of data model used in data warehousing. It is an extension of the star schema where some dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.

In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are broken down into additional tables to eliminate redundancy and reduce data storage. For example, a product dimension table might be normalized into separate tables for product category, product subcategory, and product details.

The snowflake schema gets its name because the diagram of the schema resembles a snowflake, with the fact table at the center and the dimension tables branching out into multiple levels.

The snowflake schema has some advantages over the star schema:

- Reduced data redundancy: By normalizing dimension tables, the snowflake schema reduces data storage requirements.
- Improved data integrity: Normalization helps ensure that data is consistent and accurate.
- Flexibility: The snowflake schema can accommodate more complex relationships between dimensions.

However, the snowflake schema also has some disadvantages:

- Increased complexity: The schema is more complex than a star schema, which can make it harder to understand and maintain.
- Reduced query performance: The normalized structure may require more joins to retrieve data, which can slow down queries.

Snowflake schemas are less common than star schemas in data warehousing, but they may be used in scenarios where data storage is a concern or where dimensions have complex hierarchies.

## 1.11. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization. It involves defining policies, procedures, and standards for data management, and ensuring that these are followed across the organization.

Data governance is important for ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. It helps organizations make better decisions based on reliable data, and it reduces the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.

Key components of data governance include:

- Data quality: Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Data security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring that it is used in compliance with regulations.
- Data privacy: Ensuring that personal data is handled in accordance with privacy laws and regulations.
- Data lineage: Tracking the origin and movement of data through the organization.
- Metadata management: Managing information about the data, such as its definition, structure, and usage.
- Data stewardship: Assigning responsibility for data quality and management to specific individuals or teams.

Data governance is typically overseen by a data governance council or committee, which includes representatives from business and IT. The council is responsible for defining data policies and standards, and for monitoring compliance.

Data governance is particularly important in data warehousing and data lake environments, where data from multiple sources is integrated and used for analysis and decision making. It helps ensure that the data in these systems is reliable and can be trusted by users.

## 1.12. What is Data Quality?

Data quality refers to the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability, and whether it's up to date. High-quality data is essential for making informed decisions, as poor-quality data can lead to incorrect conclusions and bad business decisions.

Data quality is measured using several dimensions:

- Accuracy: The extent to which data correctly describes the real-world object or event it represents.
- Completeness: The extent to which all required data is present.
- Consistency: The extent to which data is consistent across different systems and over time.
- Timeliness: The extent to which data is up to date and available when needed.
- Uniqueness: The extent to which there are no duplicate records.
- Validity: The extent to which data conforms to specified rules and formats.

Data quality is managed through a combination of processes, tools, and policies. These may include:

- Data profiling: Analyzing data to understand its structure, content, and quality.
- Data cleansing: Correcting errors and inconsistencies in data.
- Data validation: Checking data against defined rules to ensure it meets quality standards.
- Data monitoring: Continuously monitoring data quality to identify and address issues.

Data quality is a critical aspect of data governance and data management. It is particularly important in data warehousing and data lake environments, where data from multiple sources is integrated and used for analysis. Poor data quality can undermine the value of these systems and lead to mistrust among users.

## 1.13. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data from its origin to its destination, including all the transformations and processes it undergoes along the way. It provides a complete record of where data comes from, how it is transformed, and where it is used.

Data lineage is important for several reasons:

- Impact analysis: Understanding how changes to data sources or transformations will affect downstream systems and reports.
- Data quality: Identifying the source of data quality issues and understanding how data is transformed.
- Compliance: Demonstrating compliance with regulations that require tracking of data origins and transformations.
- Debugging: Helping to identify and fix issues in data pipelines and transformations.

Data lineage can be captured at different levels of detail:

- Business lineage: High-level tracking of data flow between business processes and systems.
- Technical lineage: Detailed tracking of data flow through specific systems, databases, and transformations.

Data lineage is typically managed using specialized tools that automatically capture and visualize the flow of data. These tools may integrate with data integration platforms, data warehouses, and other systems to collect lineage information.

Data lineage is a key component of data governance and data management. It helps organizations understand their data and ensure that it is used appropriately and reliably.

## 1.14. What is Metadata?

Metadata is data about data. It provides information about the characteristics of data, such as its structure, format, source, and usage. Metadata helps users understand and work with data more effectively.

There are several types of metadata:

- Technical metadata: Information about the technical aspects of data, such as its storage format, data types, and database schema.
- Business metadata: Information about the business context of data, such as its definition, business rules, and ownership.
- Operational metadata: Information about the processes and operations that create and use data
