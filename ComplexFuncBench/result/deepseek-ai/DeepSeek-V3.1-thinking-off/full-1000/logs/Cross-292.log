## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository. Data pipelines are used to populate data warehouses, data lakes, and data marts.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a type of data pipeline that extracts data from a source system, transforms it into a format that can be loaded into a target repository, and then loads it into the target repository.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. It is a type of data pipeline that extracts data from a source system, loads it into a target repository, and then transforms it into a format that can be used for analysis.

## 1.8. What is a Data Model?

A data model is a conceptual representation of data objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules that govern these associations. Data models are used to design databases and data warehouses.

## 1.9. What is a Star Schema?

A star schema is a type of data model that is used in data warehouses. It consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.

## 1.10. What is a Snowflake Schema?

A snowflake schema is a type of data model that is used in data warehouses. It is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the entity relationship diagram resembles a snowflake shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.

## 1.11. What is a Fact Table?

A fact table is a table in a star schema of a data warehouse. It stores quantitative information for analysis and is often denormalized. A fact table works with dimension tables and it holds the data to be analyzed.

## 1.12. What is a Dimension Table?

A dimension table is a table in a star schema of a data warehouse. It stores attributes or dimensions that describe the objects in a fact table. Dimension tables are used to filter, group, and label data in fact tables.

## 1.13. What is a Slowly Changing Dimension?

A slowly changing dimension (SCD) is a dimension that stores and manages both current and historical data over time in a data warehouse. It is considered and implemented as one of the most critical ETL tasks in tracking the history of dimension records.

## 1.14. What is a Data Vault?

Data Vault is a data modeling technique that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed, and resilience to change.

## 1.15. What is a Data Mesh?

Data Mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access, and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments—within or across organizations. Data Mesh is a new way of thinking about data architecture and organizational structure.

## 1.16. What is a Data Fabric?

Data Fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. Data Fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed data environment.

## 1.17. What is a Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a centralized inventory of data assets across the enterprise. It uses metadata to help organizations manage their data. It also helps data professionals collect, organize, access, and enrich metadata to support data discovery and governance.

## 1.18. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is a collection of processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals. It establishes the processes and responsibilities that ensure the quality and security of the data used across a business or organization.

## 1.19. What is Data Quality?

Data quality refers to the condition of a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. It is an assessment of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context. Data quality is measured by factors such as accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance.

## 1.20. What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining the data available from an existing information source (e.g. a database or a file) and collecting statistics and information about that data. The purpose of data profiling is to understand the data and its structure, and to identify data quality issues.

## 1.21. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it has changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline. Data lineage is used to gain visibility into the data pipeline and to track errors back to their source.

## 1.22. What is Data Observability?

Data observability is the ability to understand the health and state of data in your system. It is a set of practices and tools that provide visibility into the data pipeline, allowing you to monitor, track, and troubleshoot data issues in real time.

## 1.23. What is DataOps?

DataOps is a set of practices, processes, and technologies that combines an integrated and process-oriented perspective on data with automation and methods from agile software engineering to improve quality, speed, and collaboration and promote a culture of continuous improvement in the field of data analytics.

## 1.24. What is MLOps?

MLOps is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. The word is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous development practice of DevOps in the software field.

## 1.25. What is a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is a type of software engineer who specializes in designing, building, and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports data analysis and data science.
