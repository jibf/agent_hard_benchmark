## 1.1. What is a Web Service?

A Web Service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards.

## 1.2. What is a RESTful Web Service?

RESTful Web Services are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

## 1.3. What is a REST API?

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

## 1.4. What is a SOAP Web Service?

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

## 1.5. What is a WSDL?

WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML-based interface description language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service. The acronym is also used for any specific WSDL description of a web service (also known as a WSDL file).

## 1.6. What is a UDDI?

UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) is a platform-independent, XML-based registry for businesses worldwide to list themselves on the Internet. UDDI is an open industry initiative, sponsored by OASIS, enabling businesses to publish service listings and discover each other and define how the services or software applications interact over the Internet.

## 1.7. What is a SOA?

SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

## 1.8. What is a Microservice?

Microservices are a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop, and test.

## 1.9. What is a Web Service Client?

A Web Service Client is a software application that interacts with a web service. The client sends a request to the web service and receives a response. The client can be a web browser, a mobile application, or another web service.

## 1.10. What is a Web Service Provider?

A Web Service Provider is a software application that provides a web service. The provider receives a request from a client and sends a response. The provider can be a web server, a mobile application, or another web service.

## 1.11. What is a Web Service Consumer?

A Web Service Consumer is a software application that consumes a web service. The consumer sends a request to the web service and receives a response. The consumer can be a web browser, a mobile application, or another web service.

## 1.12. What is a Web Service Proxy?

A Web Service Proxy is a software application that acts as an intermediary between a client and a web service. The proxy receives a request from a client and forwards it to the web service. The proxy then receives the response from the web service and forwards it to the client.

## 1.13. What is a Web Service Gateway?

A Web Service Gateway is a software application that acts as an intermediary between a client and a web service. The gateway receives a request from a client and forwards it to the web service. The gateway then receives the response from the web service and forwards it to the client.

## 1.14. What is a Web Service Broker?

A Web Service Broker is a software application that acts as an intermediary between a client and a web service. The broker receives a request from a client and forwards it to the web service. The broker then receives the response from the web service and forwards it to the client.
