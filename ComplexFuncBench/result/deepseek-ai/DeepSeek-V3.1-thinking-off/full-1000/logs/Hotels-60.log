We will certainly look into improving our ventilation and cleaning processes to ensure that such issues are resolved more swiftly in the future.\n\nRegarding the windows, we have noted your concern and will assess if there are any changes we can make to enhance our guests' experience.\n\nWe hope to welcome you back soon for an even better stay.\n",

## 1.1. What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data structures as:

- Mathematical/Logical models or Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Implementation

## 1.2. Data Structure Operations

- Traversing
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sorting
- Merging

## 1.3. Why Data Structures?

- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
- They help to manage and organize data.
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

## 1.4. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) vs. Data Structures

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## 1.5. Examples

| ADT      | Implementation                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List     | Dynamic Array, Linked List                      |
| Queue    | Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue      |
| Map      | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table                 |
| Vehicle  | Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car                   |

## 1.6. Complexity Analysis

As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over and over again:

- How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
- How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?

### 1.6.1. Big-O Notation

Big-O notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

- $n$ - The size of the input
- Complexities ordered from smallest to largest

| Constant Time: | $O(1)$         |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Logarithmic:   | $O(\log(n))$   |
| Linear:        | $O(n)$         |
| Linearithmic:  | $O(n\log(n))$  |
| Quadratic:     | $O(n^2)$       |
| Cubic:         | $O(n^3)$       |
| Exponential:   | $O(b^n), b > 1$ |
| Factorial:     | $O(n!)$        |

### 1.6.2. Big-O Properties

$O(n + c) = O(n)$
$O(cn) = O(n), c > 0$

Let $f$ be a function that describes the running time of a particular algorithm for an input of size $n$:

$f(n) = 7\log(n)^3 + 15n^2 + 2n^3 + 8$

$O(f(n)) = O(n^3)$

### 1.6.3. Big-O Examples

The following run in constant time: $O(1)$

```java
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = a + 5 * b;
```

```java
i = 0;
while (i < 11) {
    i = i + 1;
}
```

The following run in linear time: $O(n)$

```java
i = 0;
while (i < n) {
    i = i + 1;
}
```

```java
i = 0;
while (i < n) {
    i = i + 3;
}
```

> $O(n/3) = O(n)$

Both of the following run in quadratic time: $O(n^2)$

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

> The inner loop does $n$ work and the outer loop runs $n$ times.

```java
i = 0;
while (i < n) {
    j = 0;
    while (j < 3 * n) {
        j = j + 1;
    }
    j = 0;
    while (j < 2 * n) {
        j = j + 1;
    }
    i = i + 1;
}
```

> $O(n * (3n + 2n)) = O(n * 5n) = O(5n^2) = O(n^2)$

```java
i = 0;
while (i < 3 * n) {
    j = 10;
    while (j <= 50) {
        j = j + 1;
    }
    j = 0;
    while (j < n * n * n) {
        j = j + 2;
    }
    i = i + 1;
}
```

> $O(3n * (40 + (n^3)/2)) = O(3n * (n^3)) = O(3n^4) = O(n^4)$

### 1.6.4. Complexity Analysis Examples

Suppose we have a computer that can perform $10^8$ operations per second.

| $n$  | $\log_2(n)$ | $n$    | $n\log_2(n)$ | $n^2$      | $n^3$          | $2^n$               | $n!$                     |

### 1.6.5. Logarithm

**Definition**: A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number.

For example, the base ten logarithm of 100 is 2, because ten raised to the power of two is 100:

$\log_{10}(100) = 2$

**Example**:

$\log_2(8) = 3$

$\log_2(64) = 6$

$\log_2(n) = k \Longleftrightarrow 2^k = n$

**Important**: The base of the logarithm is not important in Big-O notation, since:

$\log_a(n) = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(a)} = \text{constant} \times \log_b(n)$

Hence, we can always switch between different bases:

$O(\log_2(n)) = O(\log_3(n)) = O(\log(n))$

### 1.6.6. Binary Search Example

Suppose we have a sorted array and we want to find the index of a particular value in the array, if it exists. What is the time complexity of binary search?

```java
// Returns the index of the value, or -1 if not found
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int value) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < value) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

> $O(\log(n))$

### 1.6.7. Recursive Algorithm

Suppose we have a recursive algorithm that splits the input in half at each recursive call and does a constant amount of work.

```java
int sum(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    return n + sum(n / 2);
}
```

> $T(n) = T(n/2) + 1$
> $T(n) = T(n/4) + 1 + 1$
> $T(n) = T(n/8) + 1 + 1 + 1$
> ...
> $T(n) = T(1) + \log_2(n)$
> $T(n) = O(\log(n))$

### 1.6.8. Another Recursive Algorithm

```java
void f(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return;
    f(n / 2);
    f(n / 2);
}
```

> $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 1$
> $T(n) = 2(2T(n/4) + 1) + 1 = 4T(n/4) + 2 + 1$
> $T(n) = 4(2T(n/8) + 1) + 2 + 1 = 8T(n/8) + 4 + 2 + 1$
> ...
> $T(n) = 2^k T(n/2^k) + (2^k - 1)$
> Let $k = \log_2(n)$
> $T(n) = n T(1) + (n - 1)$
> $T(n) = O(n)$

### 1.6.9. Space Complexity

How much memory does the algorithm need?

```java
int sum(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    return n + sum(n - 1);
}
```

> $O(n)$

```java
int pairSumSequence(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += pairSum(i, i + 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int pairSum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

> $O(1)$

### 1.6.10. Amortized Analysis

Amortized analysis gives the average performance (over time) of each operation in the worst case.

**Dynamic Array**

When the array is full, we create a new array of double the size and copy the elements.

| Operation | Cost      |
| --------- | --------- |
| Insert    | $O(1)$*   |
| Append    | $O(1)$*   |
| Delete    | $O(1)$*   |

> *amortized

### 1.6.11. Summary

- Big-O notation describes the upper bound of the complexity.
- We can ignore constants and lower order terms.
- Complexity can be time or space.
- Amortized analysis gives the average performance of operations.
