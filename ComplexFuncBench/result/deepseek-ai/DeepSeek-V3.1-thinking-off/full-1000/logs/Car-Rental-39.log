## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is a data integration process for transferring raw data from a source server to a data system (such as a data warehouse or data lake) on a target server and then preparing the information for downstream uses.

## 1.8. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures.

## 1.9. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is a set of principles and practices that ensure high quality through the complete lifecycle of data. According to the Data Governance Institute (DGI), it is a practical and actionable framework to help a variety of data stakeholders across any organization identify and meet their information needs.

## 1.10. What is Data Quality?

Data quality is a measure of the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability and whether it's up to date.

## 1.11. What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing, and creating useful summaries of data. The process yields a high-level overview which aids in the discovery of data quality issues, risks, and overall trends.

## 1.12. What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.

## 1.13. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation.

## 1.14. What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another. While this might seem pretty straightforward, it involves a change in storage and database or application.

## 1.15. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of copying data from one location to another. The result is a distributed database in which users can access data relevant to their tasks without interfering with the work of others.

## 1.16. What is Data Virtualization?

Data virtualization is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data, such as how it is formatted at source, or where it is physically located.

## 1.17. What is Data Federation?

Data federation is the creation of a virtual database that aggregates data from disparate sources into a single, unified view. This approach allows users to query and manipulate data as if it were stored in a single location, without the need for physical data movement or replication.

## 1.18. What is Data Orchestration?

Data orchestration is the automation of data-driven processes from end to end, including preparing data, making it available for data science and machine learning, and putting insights into production.

## 1.19. What is Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a detailed inventory of all data assets in an organization, designed to help data professionals quickly find the most appropriate data for any analytical or business purpose.

## 1.20. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of understanding, recording, and visualizing data as it flows from data sources to consumption. This includes all transformations the data underwent along the way—how the data was transformed, what changed, and why.

## 1.21. What is Data Masking?

Data masking is a method of creating a structurally similar but inauthentic version of an organization's data that can be used for purposes such as software testing and user training. The purpose is to protect the actual data while having a functional substitute for occasions when the real data is not required.

## 1.22. What is Data Encryption?

Data encryption is a way of translating data from plaintext (unencrypted) to ciphertext (encrypted). Users can access encrypted data with an encryption key and decrypted data with a decryption key.

## 1.23. What is Data Compression?

Data compression is the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size. Fundamentally, it involves re-encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

## 1.24. What is Data Deduplication?

Data deduplication is a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data. Successful implementation of the technique can improve storage utilization, which may in turn lower capital expenditure by reducing the overall amount of storage media required to meet storage capacity needs.

## 1.25. What is Data Archiving?

Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for long-term retention. Archive data consists of older data that is still important to the organization and may be needed for future reference, as well as data that must be retained for regulatory compliance.

## 1.26. What is Data Retention?

Data retention defines the policies of persistent data and records management for meeting legal and business data archival requirements.

## 1.27. What is Data Lifecycle Management?

Data lifecycle management (DLM) is a policy-based approach to managing the flow of an information system's data throughout its lifecycle: from creation and initial storage to the time when it becomes obsolete and is deleted.

## 1.28. What is Master Data Management?

Master data management (MDM) is a technology-enabled discipline in which business and IT work together to ensure the uniformity, accuracy, stewardship, semantic consistency and accountability of the enterprise's official shared master data assets.

## 1.29. What is Reference Data Management?

Reference data management (RDM) is the process of managing classifications and hierarchies across systems and business lines. This may include performing analytics on reference data, and ensuring that reference data is accurate, consistent and complete.

## 1.30. What is Metadata Management?

Metadata management is the administration of data that describes other data. It involves establishing policies and processes that ensure information can be integrated, accessed, shared, linked, analyzed and maintained to best effect across the organization.

## 1.31. What is Data Stewardship?

Data stewardship is the management and oversight of an organization's data assets to help provide business users with high-quality data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner.

## 1.32. What is Data Ownership?

Data ownership is the act of having legal rights and complete control over a single piece or set of data elements. It defines and provides information about the rightful owner of data assets and the acquisition, use and distribution policy implemented by the data owner.

## 1.33. What is Data Privacy?
