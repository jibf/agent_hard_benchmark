## 1.1. What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data structures as:

- Mathematical/logical models or abstract data types (ADTs)
- Implementation

## 1.2. What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?

An ADT is a mathematical model of a data structure that specifies:

- The type of data stored
- The operations supported on them
- The types of parameters of the operations

An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it.

## 1.3. Why Data Structures?

Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.

Some common examples of data structures are:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Graphs

## 1.4. Why Data Structures?

The choice of data structure can make a big difference in the performance of a program.

For example, if we want to store a list of numbers and we want to be able to quickly find the smallest number, we might use a heap.

If we want to store a list of numbers and we want to be able to quickly find if a number is in the list, we might use a hash table.

If we want to store a list of numbers and we want to be able to quickly add and remove numbers from the beginning and end of the list, we might use a linked list.

## 1.5. Why Data Structures?

The choice of data structure can also make a big difference in the memory usage of a program.

For example, if we want to store a list of numbers and we know that the list will never have more than 10 numbers, we might use an array.

If we want to store a list of numbers and we don't know how many numbers there will be, we might use a linked list.
