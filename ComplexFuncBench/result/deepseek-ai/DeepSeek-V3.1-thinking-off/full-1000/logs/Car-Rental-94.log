## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT (extract, load, transform) and ETL (extract, transform, load) are both data integration processes that move raw data from a source system to a target database, such as a data lake or data warehouse.

## 1.8. What is a Data Model?

A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

## 1.9. What is a Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a centralized inventory of data assets (including data sources, data sets, data models, data quality, data lineage, and data governance) that enables data discovery and data governance.

## 1.10. What is Data Governance?

## 1.11. What is Data Quality?

Data quality is a measure of the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability, and whether it's up to date.

## 1.12. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it has changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline.

## 1.13. What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining the data available from an existing information source (e.g. a database or a file) and collecting statistics and information about that data.

## 1.14. What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

## 1.15. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation.

## 1.16. What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of selecting, preparing, extracting, and transforming data and permanently transferring it from one computer storage system to another.

## 1.17. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of storing data in more than one site or node. It is useful in improving the availability of data.

## 1.18. What is Data Synchronization?

Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.

## 1.19. What is Data Virtualization?

Data virtualization is an approach to data management that allows an application to retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details about the data, such as how it is formatted at source, or where it is physically located.

## 1.20. What is Data Federation?

Data federation is an aspect of data virtualization where the data stored in a heterogeneous set of autonomous data stores are made accessible to data consumers as one integrated data store by using on-demand data integration.

## 1.21. What is Data Warehousing?
