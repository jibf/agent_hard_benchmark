2025-08-25 12:02:50,481 - evaluation_logger_Cross-216 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from Toronto on December 2, 2024, going to Vancouver and Edmonton, then returning to Toronto. I'm expecting to stay in each city for a week. My address is 200 Bloor St W in Toronto. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

## 1.1. Background

The use of the Internet has become an integral part of our daily lives, and the amount of data generated and transmitted over the Internet is increasing at an unprecedented rate. This has led to the development of new technologies and protocols to handle the growing demand for data transmission. One such technology is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is the most widely used protocol for data transmission over the Internet.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. However, TCP has some limitations, such as its inability to handle large amounts of data efficiently and its susceptibility to congestion. To address these limitations, several extensions and modifications have been proposed to TCP, one of which is the TCP Fast Open (TFO) extension.

TFO is an extension to TCP that allows data to be exchanged during the connection establishment phase, reducing the latency associated with the three-way handshake. This is particularly beneficial for short-lived connections, such as those used by web browsers to fetch web pages. TFO was first proposed in 2011 and has since been implemented in various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Despite its benefits, TFO has some security implications that need to be addressed. For example, TFO allows data to be sent before the connection is fully established, which could potentially be exploited by attackers to launch denial-of-service attacks or to inject malicious data into the connection. Therefore, it is important to understand the security implications of TFO and to develop mechanisms to mitigate these risks.

In this paper, we provide an overview of TFO, discuss its security implications, and propose a mechanism to enhance the security of TFO. We also present the results of our experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

## 1.2. Problem Statement

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the backbone of the Internet, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. However, TCP has some limitations, particularly in terms of latency. The three-way handshake used by TCP to establish a connection introduces a round-trip time (RTT) delay before any data can be transmitted. This delay can be significant for short-lived connections, such as those used by web browsers to fetch web pages.

To address this issue, the TCP Fast Open (TFO) extension was proposed. TFO allows data to be exchanged during the connection establishment phase, reducing the latency associated with the three-way handshake. This is achieved by using a TFO cookie, which is a cryptographic token that is issued by the server to the client during a previous connection. The client includes this cookie in the SYN packet of subsequent connections, allowing the server to verify the client's identity and to start sending data immediately after receiving the SYN packet.

While TFO can significantly reduce latency, it also introduces security risks. Specifically, TFO allows data to be sent before the connection is fully established, which could potentially be exploited by attackers. For example, an attacker could use a forged SYN packet with a valid TFO cookie to inject malicious data into the connection. Alternatively, an attacker could launch a denial-of-service attack by sending a large number of SYN packets with valid TFO cookies, causing the server to allocate resources for processing the data included in these packets.

Therefore, there is a need to enhance the security of TFO to prevent such attacks. In particular, it is important to ensure that only legitimate clients can use TFO and that the data sent during the connection establishment phase is authentic and cannot be tampered with.

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a mechanism to enhance the security of TFO. Our mechanism involves the use of digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase. We also present the results of our experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

## 1.3. Research Objectives

The main objective of this research is to enhance the security of the TCP Fast Open (TFO) extension while maintaining its performance benefits. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Analyze the security implications of TFO**: We will conduct a thorough analysis of the security risks associated with TFO, including the potential for denial-of-service attacks and data injection attacks. We will also review existing security mechanisms for TFO and identify their limitations.

2. **Propose a security enhancement mechanism for TFO**: Based on our analysis, we will propose a mechanism to enhance the security of TFO. Our mechanism will involve the use of digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase.

3. **Implement and evaluate the proposed mechanism**: We will implement our proposed mechanism in a simulated environment and evaluate its effectiveness in mitigating the identified security risks. We will also measure the performance overhead introduced by our mechanism and compare it with the performance benefits of TFO.

4. **Provide recommendations for the deployment of TFO**: Based on our findings, we will provide recommendations for the secure deployment of TFO in real-world networks.

By achieving these objectives, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and performance of TCP and to make the Internet a safer and more efficient place for everyone.

## 1.4. Scope and Limitations

This research focuses on the security aspects of the TCP Fast Open (TFO) extension. Specifically, we will investigate the potential security risks associated with TFO and propose a mechanism to mitigate these risks. Our proposed mechanism will involve the use of digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase.

However, there are some limitations to our research. First, our proposed mechanism may introduce additional overhead in terms of computational resources and network latency. We will evaluate this overhead and compare it with the performance benefits of TFO, but we may not be able to completely eliminate it.

Second, our research is based on a simulated environment, and the results may not fully reflect the behavior of TFO in real-world networks. Therefore, further testing and validation in real-world environments may be necessary to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

Finally, our research focuses on the security of TFO and does not address other aspects of TCP, such as congestion control or flow control. While these aspects are important for the overall performance and reliability of TCP, they are beyond the scope of this research.

Despite these limitations, we believe that our research will provide valuable insights into the security implications of TFO and will contribute to the development of more secure and efficient TCP extensions.

# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1. TCP and Its Extensions

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It operates at the transport layer and provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection must be established between the client and server before data can be transmitted. This connection is established using a three-way handshake, which involves the exchange of SYN and ACK packets.

While TCP is highly reliable, it has some limitations. One of the main limitations is the latency introduced by the three-way handshake. For short-lived connections, such as those used by web browsers to fetch web pages, this latency can be significant. To address this issue, several extensions to TCP have been proposed, including TCP Fast Open (TFO).

TFO is an extension that allows data to be exchanged during the connection establishment phase, reducing the latency associated with the three-way handshake. TFO uses a cookie-based mechanism to authenticate the client and to ensure that the data sent during the connection establishment phase is legitimate. The cookie is issued by the server to the client during a previous connection and is included in the SYN packet of subsequent connections.

Other extensions to TCP include:

- **TCP Cubic**: A congestion control algorithm that is designed to be more aggressive than standard TCP in high-bandwidth environments.
- **TCP BBR**: A congestion-based congestion control algorithm that uses measurements of the network's bandwidth and round-trip time to optimize data transmission.
- **MPTCP**: Multipath TCP, which allows a single TCP connection to use multiple paths simultaneously, improving reliability and performance.

These extensions have been developed to address various limitations of TCP, but they also introduce new security challenges. In the following sections, we will focus on the security implications of TFO and discuss existing security mechanisms for TFO.

## 2.2. TCP Fast Open (TFO)

TCP Fast Open (TFO) is an extension to TCP that allows data to be exchanged during the connection establishment phase. This is achieved by using a TFO cookie, which is a cryptographic token that is issued by the server to the client during a previous connection. The client includes this cookie in the SYN packet of subsequent connections, allowing the server to verify the client's identity and to start sending data immediately after receiving the SYN packet.

The TFO cookie is generated by the server using a secret key and includes information such as the client's IP address and a timestamp. The cookie is typically valid for a limited period of time, after which it must be renewed. This helps to prevent replay attacks and ensures that the cookie cannot be used indefinitely.

TFO can significantly reduce latency for short-lived connections, such as those used by web browsers to fetch web pages. Studies have shown that TFO can reduce the time required to establish a connection and start transmitting data by up to 50% in some cases.

However, TFO also introduces security risks. For example, an attacker could use a forged SYN packet with a valid TFO cookie to inject malicious data into the connection. Alternatively, an attacker could launch a denial-of-service attack by sending a large number of SYN packets with valid TFO cookies, causing the server to allocate resources for processing the data included in these packets.

To mitigate these risks, TFO includes several security mechanisms. For example, the TFO cookie is encrypted using a secret key known only to the server, making it difficult for an attacker to forge a valid cookie. Additionally, the server can limit the amount of data that can be sent during the connection establishment phase and can rate-limit the number of TFO requests from a single client.

Despite these mechanisms, TFO is not foolproof, and there have been several reported vulnerabilities and attacks against TFO. In the next section, we will discuss these security issues in more detail.

## 2.3. Security Issues in TFO

While TCP Fast Open (TFO) provides performance benefits, it also introduces several security issues. These issues primarily stem from the fact that TFO allows data to be sent before the connection is fully established, which can be exploited by attackers.

### 2.3.1. Data Injection Attacks

One of the main security concerns with TFO is the potential for data injection attacks. An attacker who obtains a valid TFO cookie can include it in a forged SYN packet and send data to the server before the connection is established. This data could be malicious, such as SQL injection code or other exploit payloads, and could compromise the server or the application running on it.

The risk of data injection attacks is particularly high if the TFO cookie is not properly secured. For example, if the cookie is transmitted over an insecure channel or if the server's secret key is compromised, an attacker could easily forge valid cookies.

### 2.3.2. Denial-of-Service Attacks

TFO can also be used to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. An attacker can send a large number of SYN packets with valid TFO cookies, each containing a small amount of data. The server will allocate resources to process these packets, potentially exhausting its memory or CPU resources and making it unavailable to legitimate clients.

This type of attack is similar to a SYN flood attack but is more effective because the server processes the data included in the SYN packets, which requires additional resources. Additionally, because the TFO cookie is valid for a limited time, an attacker can continuously obtain new cookies and use them in attacks.

### 2.3.3. Replay Attacks

Another security issue with TFO is the potential for replay attacks. If an attacker intercepts a TFO cookie, they can use it in subsequent connections to impersonate the legitimate client. While the cookie has a limited validity period, it can still be used during that period to establish connections and send data.

To mitigate replay attacks, TFO cookies typically include a timestamp and are valid only for a short period. However, if the attacker can obtain the cookie quickly enough, they can still use it before it expires.

### 2.3.4. Privacy Concerns

TFO cookies can also raise privacy concerns. Because the cookie is tied to the client's IP address, it can be used to track the client across multiple connections. This could potentially be used for user profiling or other privacy-invasive purposes.

To address these security issues, several mechanisms have been proposed and implemented. In the next section, we will discuss these mechanisms and their limitations.

## 2.4. Existing Security Mechanisms for TFO

To mitigate the security risks associated with TCP Fast Open (TFO), several mechanisms have been proposed and implemented. These mechanisms aim to ensure that only legitimate clients can use TFO and that the data sent during the connection establishment phase is authentic and cannot be tampered with.

### 2.4.1. Cookie Encryption and Integrity Protection

The TFO cookie is encrypted using a secret key known only to the server. This prevents attackers from forging or tampering with the cookie. Additionally, the cookie includes a message authentication code (MAC) to ensure its integrity. The MAC is computed using a cryptographic hash function and the server's secret key, making it difficult for an attacker to modify the cookie without detection.

### 2.4.2. Cookie Expiration and Renewal

TFO cookies have a limited validity period, typically on the order of a few minutes. This helps to prevent replay attacks, as an intercepted cookie will expire quickly. Additionally, cookies are renewed periodically, requiring the client to obtain a new cookie from the server after the old one expires.

### 2.4.3. Rate Limiting

Servers can implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks. For example, a server can limit the number of TFO requests from a single IP address within a certain time window. This helps to prevent an attacker from overwhelming the server with a large number of SYN packets containing TFO cookies.

### 2.4.4. Data Length Limitations

To reduce the impact of data injection attacks, servers can limit the amount of data that can be sent during the connection establishment phase. For example, the server may only accept a small amount of data (e.g., a few hundred bytes) in the SYN packet. This limits the amount of malicious data that can be injected by an attacker.

### 2.4.5. Client Authentication

In some implementations, TFO cookies are tied to the client's IP address. This ensures that only the client with the same IP address can use the cookie. However, this can be problematic in environments where clients have dynamic IP addresses or are behind network address translation (NAT).

Despite these mechanisms, TFO is not completely secure. For example, if the server's secret key is compromised, an attacker can generate valid TFO cookies and launch attacks. Additionally, rate limiting and data length limitations may not be sufficient to prevent all types of attacks.

In the next chapter, we will propose a new security enhancement mechanism for TFO that addresses these limitations.

## 2.5. Summary

In this chapter, we reviewed the relevant literature on TCP, TFO, and network security. We discussed the limitations of TCP and how TFO addresses these limitations by allowing data to be exchanged during the connection establishment phase. We also discussed the security issues associated with TFO, including data injection attacks, denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and privacy concerns.

We then reviewed existing security mechanisms for TFO, such as cookie encryption, expiration, rate limiting, data length limitations, and client authentication. While these mechanisms provide some level of security, they are not foolproof and have limitations.

In the next chapter, we will propose a new security enhancement mechanism for TFO that uses digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase. We will also describe the implementation and evaluation of this mechanism.

# 3. Methodology

## 3.1. Research Design

This research aims to enhance the security of TCP Fast Open (TFO) by proposing a new mechanism that uses digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase. The research design involves the following steps:

1. **Analysis of TFO Security Issues**: We will conduct a thorough analysis of the security issues associated with TFO, focusing on data injection attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and replay attacks. This analysis will help us identify the limitations of existing security mechanisms and guide the design of our proposed mechanism.

2. **Design of the Proposed Mechanism**: Based on our analysis, we will design a new security enhancement mechanism for TFO. Our mechanism will involve the use of digital signatures to sign the TFO cookie and the data included in the SYN packet. This will ensure that the cookie and data are authentic and have not been tampered with.

3. **Implementation**: We will implement our proposed mechanism in a simulated network environment. We will use the ns-3 network simulator to model TFO connections and to test our mechanism. The implementation will include modifications to the TCP stack to support digital signatures and to verify the signatures during the connection establishment phase.

4. **Evaluation**: We will evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in mitigating the identified security risks. We will also measure the performance overhead introduced by our mechanism, including the computational cost of generating and verifying digital signatures and the additional latency introduced by these operations.

5. **Comparison with Existing Mechanisms**: We will compare our proposed mechanism with existing security mechanisms for TFO, such as cookie encryption and rate limiting. We will assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of each mechanism and determine under what conditions our mechanism provides better security.

By following this research design, we hope to develop a robust security enhancement mechanism for TFO that can be deployed in real-world networks.

## 3.2. Proposed Security Enhancement Mechanism

Our proposed security enhancement mechanism for TFO involves the use of digital signatures to authenticate the TFO cookie and to ensure the integrity of the data sent during the connection establishment phase. The mechanism consists of the following steps:

1. **Cookie Generation**: When a client first connects to a server, the server generates a TFO cookie. The cookie includes the client's
