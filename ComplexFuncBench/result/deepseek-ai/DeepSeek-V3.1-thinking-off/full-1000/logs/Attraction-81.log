## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

A data warehouse may contain multiple databases. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns. Within each column, you can define a description of the data, such as integer, data field, or string. Tables can be organized inside of schemas, which you can think of as folders. When you query a data warehouse, it combines data from multiple tables to determine the answer and then presents the answers in a results table.

## 1.2. What is Amazon Redshift?

Amazon Redshift is a fast, scalable data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data across your data warehouse and data lake. Redshift delivers ten times faster performance than other data warehouses by using machine learning, massively parallel query execution, and columnar storage on high-performance disk.

You can set up and deploy a new data warehouse in minutes. You can start small for just $0.25 per hour and scale to petabytes of data for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the cost of traditional solutions.

You can also use the Amazon Redshift free trial to get started with Amazon Redshift for free. With the free trial, you can get started with a free cluster that includes 750 hours of ra3.4xlarge cluster usage (with 32 vCPU, 128 GiB RAM, and 4 TB of managed storage) for two months, and 8 hours of concurrency scaling usage per month for two months.

## 1.3. Key concepts

The following are key concepts for Amazon Redshift:

- **Cluster** - The core infrastructure component of an Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a cluster. A cluster is composed of one or more compute nodes. If a cluster is provisioned with two or more compute nodes, an additional leader node coordinates the compute nodes and handles external communication. Your client application interacts directly only with the leader node. The compute nodes are transparent to external applications.

- **Node** - A node is a single server in a cluster. Each node has its own CPU, memory, and attached storage. The leader node manages client connections and receives queries. The compute nodes store data and perform queries and computations. The number of compute nodes that you need depends on the size of your data, the number of queries you will run, and the query performance you need.

- **Node type** - The node type determines the CPU, RAM, and storage capacity of each node. Amazon Redshift offers different node types to support different data warehouse needs.

- **Leader node** - The leader node manages communications with client programs and all communication with compute nodes. It parses and develops execution plans to carry out database operations. In particular, the leader node distributes SQL statements to the compute nodes and assigns a portion of the data to each compute node.

- **Compute node** - Compute nodes execute the execution plans that the leader node creates. They transmit intermediate results back to the leader node for final aggregation. Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU, memory, and attached storage.

- **Database** - A database is a set of data that is organized to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. In Amazon Redshift, a database is a collection of schemas, and each schema contains tables and views.

- **Table** - A table is a set of data elements (values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows. A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.

- **Column** - A column is a set of data values of a particular type, one for each row of the table. A column may contain data values of a single data type, such as integer, floating point, string, or date.

- **Row** - A row (also called a record or tuple) represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. In simple terms, a database table can be thought of as consisting of rows and columns.

- **Schema** - A schema is a logical grouping of database objects (such as tables, views, and functions). Schemas are analogous to folders in a file system. A database can have one or more schemas, and each schema can contain one or more tables.

- **Data distribution style** - The data distribution style determines how data is distributed among the compute nodes. Amazon Redshift distributes the rows of a table to the compute nodes according to the distribution style that you choose when you create the table. The distribution style can have a significant impact on query performance.

- **Data sort key** - The sort key determines the order in which the rows in a table are stored. When you create a table, you can specify one or more columns as the sort key. Amazon Redshift stores the data on disk in sorted order according to the sort key. Sort keys can significantly improve the performance of queries that restrict the data using the sort key columns.

- **Columnar storage** - Amazon Redshift stores data in a columnar format, which means that the values for each column are stored together on disk. Columnar storage reduces the number of disk I/O requests and maximizes the throughput of the data warehouse. Columnar storage is especially effective for data warehousing and analytics because most queries only involve a subset of the columns in a table.

- **Massively parallel processing (MPP)** - Amazon Redshift uses massively parallel processing (MPP) to distribute and parallelize queries across multiple nodes. MPP enables Amazon Redshift to achieve high performance and scalability by breaking up a query into smaller parts and distributing the work across multiple nodes.

- **Concurrency scaling** - Concurrency scaling enables Amazon Redshift to automatically add additional cluster capacity to handle an increase in concurrent queries. With concurrency scaling, you can support virtually unlimited concurrent users and concurrent queries, with consistent fast query performance.

- **Elastic resize** - Elastic resize enables you to add or remove nodes from your cluster without downtime. You can use elastic resize to quickly scale your cluster up or down to meet changing performance needs.

- **Snapshot** - A snapshot is a backup of a cluster at a specific point in time. Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 and are incremental, meaning that only the data that has changed since the last snapshot is saved. You can use snapshots to restore a cluster to a previous state.

- **Data sharing** - Data sharing enables you to share data in your Amazon Redshift data warehouse with other Amazon Redshift clusters without having to copy or move the data. Data sharing provides live access to data so that users always see the most up-to-date and consistent information as it is updated in the source cluster.

- **Materialized views** - A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. Materialized views precompute and store the results of expensive queries to improve performance. Amazon Redshift automatically maintains materialized views as the underlying data changes.

- **Spectrum** - Amazon Redshift Spectrum enables you to run queries against exabytes of data in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables. With Redshift Spectrum, you can extend the analytic power of Amazon Redshift beyond the data stored in its local storage to data stored in Amazon S3.

- **Federated query** - Federated query enables you to query data across multiple databases, data warehouses, and data lakes. With federated query, you can run queries that combine data from Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, and Amazon S3.

- **Machine learning** - Amazon Redshift ML makes it easy for data analysts and database developers to create, train, and deploy machine learning models using SQL. With Redshift ML, you can use SQL statements to create and train machine learning models from your data in Amazon Redshift, and then use these models to make predictions on new data.

- **Data lake export** - Data lake export enables you to unload the result of a query to your data lake in Amazon S3. You can use data lake export to export data from Amazon Redshift to Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format, which is optimized for analytics.

- **Workload management (WLM)** - Workload management enables you to define multiple query queues and to route queries to the appropriate queues based on user groups or query groups. You can configure WLM to prioritize queries and to manage the allocation of memory and concurrency for each queue.

- **Query monitoring rules** - Query monitoring rules enable you to define rules to monitor queries and to take actions when a query matches the rule conditions. For example, you can define a rule to log, skip, or abort queries that run longer than a specified time.

- **Result caching** - Result caching enables Amazon Redshift to cache the results of frequently run queries. When a query is run again, Amazon Redshift can return the cached results instead of running the query again, which can significantly improve performance.

- **Short query acceleration (SQA)** - Short query acceleration prioritizes short-running queries ahead of longer-running queries. SQA helps to improve the performance of short-running queries by reducing the wait time in the query queue.

- **Automatic table optimization** - Automatic table optimization continuously monitors how you query your data and automatically optimizes the physical layout of your data to improve query performance. Automatic table optimization can change the distribution style and sort key of your tables to improve query performance.

- **Automatic vacuum delete** - Automatic vacuum delete automatically reclaims space and sorts rows in your tables after deletes and updates. Automatic vacuum delete helps to maintain query performance and reduce storage costs.

- **Automatic analyze** - Automatic analyze automatically updates table statistics after data changes. Updated statistics help the Amazon Redshift query optimizer to choose the most efficient query plans.

- **System tables and views** - Amazon Redshift provides system tables and views that contain information about the cluster, databases, tables, columns, queries, and other system information. You can query the system tables and views to monitor and troubleshoot your cluster.

- **Security** - Amazon Redshift provides multiple layers of security to protect your data, including network isolation, encryption at rest and in transit, and fine-grained access control. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your Amazon Redshift resources.

- **Networking** - Amazon Redshift runs in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that you define. You can use VPC security groups to control access to your cluster. You can also use VPC endpoints to keep traffic between your VPC and Amazon Redshift within the AWS network.

- **Monitoring** - Amazon Redshift provides several ways to monitor your cluster, including Amazon CloudWatch metrics, AWS CloudTrail logs, and system tables and views. You can use these monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your cluster.

- **Cost management** - Amazon Redshift provides several ways to manage costs, including pausing and resuming clusters, using reserved instances, and using concurrency scaling. You can also use the Amazon Redshift pricing calculator to estimate costs.
