## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT (extract, load, transform) is a data integration process for transferring raw data from a source server to a data system (such as a data warehouse or data lake) on a target server and then preparing the information for downstream uses.

## 1.8. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures.

## 1.9. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is a set of principles and practices that ensure high quality through the complete lifecycle of data. According to the Data Governance Institute (DGI), it is “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.”

## 1.10. What is Data Quality?

Data quality is a measure of the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability and whether it's up to date.

## 1.11. What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing, and creating useful summaries of data. The process yields a high-level overview which aids in the discovery of data quality issues, risks, and overall trends.

## 1.12. What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.

## 1.13. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation.

## 1.14. What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another. While this might seem pretty straightforward, it involves a change in storage and database or application.

## 1.15. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of copying data from one location to another. The result is a distributed database in which users can access data relevant to their tasks without interfering with the work of others.

## 1.16. What is Data Synchronization?

Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.

## 1.17. What is Data Archiving?

Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for long-term retention.

## 1.18. What is Data Backup?

Data backup is the process of copying data in an IT system to another location so it can be recovered if the original data is lost.

## 1.19. What is Data Recovery?

Data recovery is the process of restoring data that has been lost, accidentally deleted, corrupted or made inaccessible.

## 1.20. What is Data Security?

Data security is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.

## 1.21. What is Data Privacy?

Data privacy is the branch of data management that deals with handling personal data in compliance with data protection laws, regulations, and general privacy best practices.

## 1.22. What is Data Ethics?

Data ethics is a branch of ethics that evaluates data practices with the potential to adversely impact people and society—in data collection, sharing, and use.

## 1.23. What is Data Stewardship?

Data stewardship is the management and oversight of an organization's data assets to help provide business users with high-quality data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner.

## 1.24. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it has changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline.

## 1.25. What is Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a detailed inventory of all data assets in an organization, designed to help data professionals quickly find the most appropriate data for any analytical or business purpose.

## 1.26. What is Data Dictionary?

A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need to refer to them.

## 1.27. What is Data Mesh?

Data mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments—within or across organizations.

## 1.28. What is Data Fabric?

Data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments.

## 1.29. What is DataOps?
