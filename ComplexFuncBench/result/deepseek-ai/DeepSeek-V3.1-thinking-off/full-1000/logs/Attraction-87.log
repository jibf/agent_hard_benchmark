## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository. Data pipelines are used to populate data warehouses, data lakes, and data marts.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. It is a process that extracts data from source systems, transforms the data into a format that can be loaded into a data warehouse, and loads the data into the data warehouse.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT stands for Extract, Load, and Transform. It is a process that extracts data from source systems, loads the data into a data warehouse, and transforms the data into a format that can be used for analysis.

## 1.8. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. This data model is a conceptual representation of data objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules.

## 1.9. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is a collection of processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.

## 1.10. What is Data Quality?

Data quality is a measure of the condition of data based on factors such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability, and whether it's up to date.

## 1.11. What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining the data available from an existing information source (e.g. a database or a file) and collecting statistics and information about that data.

## 1.12. What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

## 1.13. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation.

## 1.14. What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of selecting, preparing, extracting, and transforming data and permanently transferring it from one computer storage system to another.

## 1.15. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of storing data in more than one site or node. It is useful in improving the availability of data.

## 1.16. What is Data Synchronization?

Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.

## 1.17. What is Data Archiving?

Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for long-term retention.

## 1.18. What is Data Backup?

Data backup is the process of copying data from a primary to a secondary location, to protect it in case of a disaster, accident, or malicious action.

## 1.19. What is Data Recovery?

Data recovery is the process of restoring data that has been lost, accidentally deleted, corrupted or made inaccessible.

## 1.20. What is Data Security?

Data security is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.

## 1.21. What is Data Privacy?

Data privacy is the branch of data management that deals with handling personal data in compliance with data protection laws, regulations, and general privacy best practices.

## 1.22. What is Data Ethics?

Data ethics is a branch of ethics that evaluates data practices with the potential to adversely impact people and society—in data collection, sharing, and use.

## 1.23. What is Data Stewardship?

Data stewardship is the management and oversight of an organization's data assets to help provide business users with high-quality data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner.

## 1.24. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it has changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline.

## 1.25. What is Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a centralized inventory of data assets across the enterprise. It uses metadata to help organizations manage their data. It also helps data professionals collect, organize, access, and enrich metadata to support data discovery and governance.

## 1.26. What is Data Dictionary?

A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need to refer to them.

## 1.27. What is Data Masking?

Data masking is a method of creating a structurally similar but inauthentic version of an organization's data that can be used for purposes such as software testing and user training. The purpose is to protect the actual data while having a functional substitute for occasions when the real data is not required.

## 1.28. What is Data Anonymization?

Data anonymization is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection. It is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.

## 1.29. What is Data Encryption?

Data encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format into an encoded format that can only be read or processed after it has been decrypted.

## 1.30. What is Data Compression?

Data compression is the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size. Fundamentally, it involves re-encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

## 1.31. What is Data Deduplication?

Data deduplication is a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data. Successful implementation of the technique can improve storage utilization, which may in turn lower capital expenditure by reducing the overall amount of storage media required to meet storage capacity needs.

Data anonymization is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection. It is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.

## 1.48. What is Data Encryption?

Data encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format into an encoded format that can only be read or processed after it has been decrypted.

## 1.49. What is Data Compression?

Data compression is the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size. Fundamentally, it involves re-encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

## 1.50. What is Data Deduplication?

Data deduplication is a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data. Successful implementation of the technique can improve storage utilization, which may in turn lower capital expenditure by reducing the overall amount of storage media required to meet storage capacity needs.

## 1.51. What is Data Partitioning?

Data partitioning is the process of dividing a logical database or its constituent elements into distinct independent parts. Database partitioning is normally done for manageability, performance or availability reasons.

## 1.52. What is Data Sharding?

Data sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards.

## 1.53. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of storing data in more than one site or node. It is useful in improving the availability of data.

## 1.54. What is Data Synchronization?

Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.

## 1.55. What is Data Archiving?

Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for long-term retention.

## 1.56. What is Data Backup?

Data backup is the process of copying data from a primary to a secondary location, to protect it in case of a disaster, accident, or malicious action.

## 1.57. What is Data Recovery?

Data recovery is the process of restoring data that has been lost, accidentally deleted, corrupted or made inaccessible.

## 1.58. What is Data Security?

Data security is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.

## 1.59. What is Data Privacy?

Data privacy is the branch of data management that deals with handling personal data in compliance with data protection laws, regulations, and general privacy best practices.

## 1.60. What is Data Ethics?

Data ethics is a branch of ethics that evaluates data practices with the potential to adversely impact people and society—in data collection, sharing, and use.

## 1.61. What is Data Stewardship?

Data stewardship is the management and oversight of an organization's data assets to help provide business users with high-quality data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner.

## 1.62. What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracking the flow of data over time, providing a clear understanding of where the data originated, how it has changed, and its ultimate destination within the data pipeline.

## 1.63. What is Data Catalog?

A data catalog is a centralized inventory of data assets across the enterprise. It uses metadata to help organizations manage their data. It also helps data professionals collect, organize, access, and enrich metadata to support data discovery and governance.

## 1.64. What is Data Dictionary?

A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need to refer to them.

## 1.65. What is Data Masking?

Data masking is a method of creating a structurally similar but inauthentic version of an organization's data that can be used for purposes such as software testing and user training. The purpose is to protect the actual data while having a functional substitute for occasions when the real data is not required.

## 1.66. What is Data Anonymization?

Data anonymization is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection. It is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.
