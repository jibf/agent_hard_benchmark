## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments - within or across organizations.

## 1.5. What is a Data Fabric?

A data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning hybrid multi-cloud environments. It is a powerful architecture that standardizes data management practices and practicalities across cloud, on premises, and edge devices.

## 1.6. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.

## 1.7. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.8. What is a Data Vault?

Data Vault is a method and architecture for delivering a Data Warehousing system. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and star schema. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise.

## 1.9. What is a Data Cube?

A data cube is a multi-dimensional array of data. Data cubes are used to represent data that is too complex to be represented by a single table. Data cubes are used in online analytical processing (OLAP) to allow analysts to view data from multiple perspectives.

## 1.10. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.11. What is a Data Lake?

You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.21. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.22. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments - within or across organizations.

## 1.23. What is a Data Fabric?
