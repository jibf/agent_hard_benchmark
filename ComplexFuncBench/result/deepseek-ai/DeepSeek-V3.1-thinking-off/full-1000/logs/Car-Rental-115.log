## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mart?

A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a particular line of business, department, or subject area. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

## 1.5. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.

## 1.6. What is ETL?

ETL, which stands for extract, transform, load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

## 1.7. What is ELT?

ELT (extract, load, transform) and ETL (extract, transform, load) are both data integration processes that move raw data from a source system to a target database, such as a data lake or data warehouse.

## 1.8. What is a Data Model?

A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

## 1.9. What is a Data Vault?

Data Vault is a method and architecture for delivering a data analytics service to enterprise information systems. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between third normal form (3NF) and star schema. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent, and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise.

## 1.10. What is a Star Schema?

A star schema is a database organizational structure optimized for use in a data warehouse or business intelligence that uses a single large fact table to store transactional or measured data, and one or more smaller dimensional tables that store attributes about the data.

## 1.11. What is a Snowflake Schema?

A snowflake schema is a multi-dimensional data model that is an extension of a star schema, where dimension tables are broken down into subdimensions. Snowflake schemas are commonly used for business intelligence and reporting in OLAP data warehouses, data marts, and relational databases.

## 1.12. What is a Fact Table?

A fact table is the central table in a star schema of a data warehouse. A fact table stores quantitative information for analysis and is often denormalized. A fact table works with dimension tables.

## 1.13. What is a Dimension Table?

A dimension table is a table in a star schema of a data warehouse. A dimension table stores attributes, or dimensions, that describe the objects in a fact table.

## 1.14. What is a Slowly Changing Dimension?

A slowly changing dimension (SCD) is a dimension that stores and manages both current and historical data over time in a data warehouse. It is considered and implemented as one of the most critical ETL tasks in tracking the history of dimension records.

## 1.15. What is a Surrogate Key?

A surrogate key is a unique identifier for either an entity in the modeled world or an object in the database. The surrogate key is not derived from application data, unlike a natural (or business) key.

## 1.16. What is a Natural Key?

A natural key is a key that is derived from the data itself, and is used to identify a record in a table. Natural keys are often used in operational systems, but are not recommended for use in data warehouses.

## 1.17. What is a Business Key?

A business key is a key that is derived from the data itself, and is used to identify a record in a table. Business keys are often used in operational systems, but are not recommended for use in data warehouses.

## 1.18. What is a Primary Key?

A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.

## 1.19. What is a Foreign Key?

A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.

## 1.20. What is a Composite Key?

A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table.

## 1.21. What is a Candidate Key?

A candidate key is a column, or set of columns, in a table that can uniquely identify any database record without referring to any other data. Each table may have one or more candidate keys. One of these candidate keys is selected as the table's primary key.

## 1.22. What is a Super Key?

A super key is a set of one or more columns that, taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely a row in a table.

## 1.23. What is a Alternate Key?

An alternate key is a candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.

## 1.24. What is a Unique Key?

A unique key is a set of one or more columns that, taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely a row in a table. The unique key constraint is used to prevent two records from having identical values in a column.

## 1.25. What is a Index?

An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure.

## 1.26. What is a Clustered Index?

A clustered index is a type of index that reorders the way records in the table are physically stored. Therefore, table can have only one clustered index.

## 1.27. What is a Non-Clustered Index?

A non-clustered index is a type of index that does not reorder the way records in the table are physically stored. Instead, it creates a separate object within the table that points back to the original table rows after searching.

## 1.28. What is a Bitmap Index?

A bitmap index is a special kind of database index that uses bitmaps. Bitmap indexes have traditionally been considered to work well for data such as gender, which has a small number of distinct values, for example, male and female, but many occurrences of those values.

## 1.29. What is a B-Tree Index?

A B-tree index is a type of index that is commonly used in databases and file systems. It is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

## 1.30. What is a Hash Index?

A hash index is a type of index that is built using a hash table. It is used to quickly locate a data record without having to search through every row in a database table.

## 1.31. What is a Full-Text Index?

A full-text index is a type of index that is built on text-based columns to facilitate fast and flexible searching for words and phrases within the text.

## 1.32. What is a Spatial Index?

A spatial index is a type of index that is built on spatial data types to facilitate fast and flexible searching for spatial objects.

## 1.33. What is a Columnstore Index?

A columnstore index is a type of index that is built on columns rather than rows. It is used to improve the performance of queries that read large amounts of data.

## 1.34. What is a Partition?

A partition is a division of a logical database or its constituent elements into distinct independent parts. Database partitioning is normally done for manageability, performance, or availability reasons.

## 1.35. What is a Shard?

A shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance, to spread load.

## 1.36. What is a Replica?

A replica is a copy of a database or database object. Replicas are used to improve performance and availability.

## 1.37. What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot is a read-only, static view of a database at a point in time.

## 1.38. What is a View?

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

## 1.39. What is a Materialized View?

A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. Unlike a view, a materialized view stores the result set of the query physically.

## 1.40. What is a Stored Procedure?

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

## 1.41. What is a Trigger?

A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs.

## 1.42. What is a Function?

A function is a database object that contains a set of SQL statements that can be executed. Functions can be used to encapsulate frequently performed logic.

## 1.43. What is a User-Defined Function?

A user-defined function is a function that is defined by the user for a specific purpose.

## 1.44. What is a Scalar Function?

A scalar function is a function that returns a single value.

## 1.45. What is a Table-Valued Function?

A table-valued function is a function that returns a table.

## 1.46. What is a Common Table Expression?

A common table expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

## 1.47. What is a Temporary Table?

A temporary table is a table that is created and exists only for the duration of a database session.

## 1.48. What is a Table Variable?

A table variable is a variable that can hold a result set for processing at a later time.

## 1.49. What is a Cursor?

## 1.50. What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or sequences of work accomplished in a logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by some sort of a database program.

## 1.51. What is ACID?

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

## 1.52. What is Atomicity?

Atomicity is the property that guarantees that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully; otherwise, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and all the previous operations are rolled back to their former state.

## 1.53. What is Consistency?

Consistency is the property that ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.

## 1.54. What is Isolation?

Isolation is the property that ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.

## 1.55. What is Durability?

Durability is the property that guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.

## 1.56. What is a Deadlock?

A deadlock is a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does.

## 1.57. What is a Lock?

A lock is a mechanism that prevents concurrent access to data in a database.

## 1.58. What is a Shared Lock?

A shared lock is a lock that allows concurrent transactions to read a resource.

## 1.59. What is an Exclusive Lock?

An exclusive lock is a lock that prevents concurrent transactions from accessing a resource.

## 1.60. What is a Intent Lock?

An intent lock is a lock that indicates that a transaction intends to acquire a shared or exclusive lock on a resource.

## 1.61. What is a Schema Lock?

A schema lock is a lock that prevents concurrent transactions from modifying the schema of a resource.

## 1.62. What is a Bulk Update Lock?

A bulk update lock is a lock that allows multiple transactions to bulk load data concurrently into the same table.

## 1.63. What is a Row-Level Lock?

A row-level lock is a lock that locks a single row in a table.

## 1.64. What is a Page-Level Lock?

A page-level lock is a lock that locks a single page in a table.

## 1.65. What is a Table-Level Lock?

A table-level lock is a lock that locks an entire table.

## 1.66. What is a Database-Level Lock?

A database-level lock is a lock that locks an entire database.

## 1.67. What is a Two-Phase Locking?

Two-phase locking is a concurrency control method that guarantees serializability.

## 1.68. What is a Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control?

Timestamp-based concurrency control is a concurrency control method that uses timestamps to determine the serializability of transactions.

## 1.69. What is a Optimistic Concurrency Control?

Optimistic concurrency control is a concurrency control method that assumes that multiple transactions can complete without interfering with each other.

## 1.70. What is a Pessimistic Concurrency Control?

Pessimistic concurrency control is a concurrency control method that assumes that multiple transactions will interfere with each other.

## 1.71. What is a Multiversion Concurrency Control?

Multiversion concurrency control is a concurrency control method that allows multiple versions of a data item to exist simultaneously.

## 1.72. What is a Snapshot Isolation?

Snapshot isolation is a concurrency control method that uses multiversion concurrency control to provide each transaction with a consistent snapshot of the database.

## 1.73. What is a Read Committed Isolation Level?

Read committed is an isolation level that guarantees that any data read is committed at the moment it is read.

## 1.74. What is a Read Uncommitted Isolation Level?

Read uncommitted is an isolation level that allows a transaction to read data that has not yet been committed.

## 1.75. What is a Repeatable Read Isolation Level?

Repeatable read is an isolation level that guarantees that any data read during a transaction will not be changed by other transactions.

## 1.76. What is a Serializable Isolation Level?

Serializable is an isolation level that guarantees that the result of a set of concurrent transactions is equivalent to some serial execution of those transactions.

## 1.77. What is a Dirty Read?

A dirty read is a read of data that has been modified by a transaction that has not yet been committed.

## 1.78. What is a Non-Repeatable Read?

A non-repeatable read is a situation in which a transaction reads the same row twice and gets different data each time.

## 1.79. What is a Phantom Read?

A phantom read is a situation in which a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a search condition, and then a second transaction inserts rows that satisfy the search condition, and then the first transaction reads the rows again and gets additional rows.

## 1.80. What is a Lost Update?

A lost update is a situation in which two transactions both update the same data item, and one of the updates is lost.

## 1.81. What is a Write Skew?

A write skew is a situation in which two transactions both read the same data item, and then each updates a different data item based on the value read, and the result is inconsistent.

## 1.82. What is a Read Skew?

A read skew is a situation in which a transaction reads data from two different data items, and the values are inconsistent.

## 1.83. What is a Fuzzy Read?

A fuzzy read is a situation in which a transaction reads data that has been modified by a transaction that has not yet been committed.

## 1.84. What is a Cursor Stability?

Cursor stability is an isolation level that guarantees that any data read by a cursor is not changed by other transactions until the cursor is moved.

## 1.85. What is a Cursor?

A cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through result sets row by row.

## 1.86. What is a Forward-Only Cursor?

A forward-only cursor is a cursor that can only move forward through the result set.

## 1.87. What is a Static Cursor?

A static cursor is a cursor that does not reflect changes made to the database after the cursor is opened.

## 1.88. What is a Dynamic Cursor?

A dynamic cursor is a cursor that reflects all changes made to the database after the cursor is opened.

## 1.89. What is a Keyset-Driven Cursor?

A keyset-driven cursor is a cursor that reflects changes made to the database after the cursor is opened, but only for rows that were in the result set when the cursor was opened.

## 1.90. What is a Firehose Cursor?

A firehose cursor is a cursor that retrieves all rows from the result set as quickly as possible.

## 1.91. What is a Server-Side Cursor?

A server-side cursor is a cursor that is managed by the database server.

## 1.92. What is a Client-Side Cursor?

A client-side cursor is a cursor that is managed by the client application.

## 1.93. What is a Implicit Cursor?

An implicit cursor is a cursor that is automatically created by the database server when a SQL statement is executed.

## 1.94. What is a Explicit Cursor?

An explicit cursor is
