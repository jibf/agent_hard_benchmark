## 1.1. Background

The use of digital technologies in the financial sector has been growing rapidly in recent years. This has led to the emergence of a new field known as FinTech, which combines financial services with technology to create innovative products and services. FinTech has the potential to revolutionize the way financial services are delivered, making them more accessible, efficient, and affordable.

One of the key areas where FinTech is having a significant impact is in the field of financial inclusion. Financial inclusion refers to the process of ensuring that all individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services. This includes access to banking, credit, insurance, and other financial services.

Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, there are still many people around the world who are excluded from the formal financial system. According to the World Bank, around 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, meaning they do not have an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money provider. This is a significant problem, as financial exclusion can limit people's ability to save, invest, and protect themselves against financial shocks.

FinTech has the potential to address this problem by providing new and innovative ways to deliver financial services to underserved populations. For example, mobile money services have made it possible for people in remote areas to access financial services using their mobile phones. Similarly, peer-to-peer lending platforms have made it easier for small businesses to access credit.

However, there are also challenges associated with the use of FinTech for financial inclusion. One of the main challenges is ensuring that these technologies are accessible and affordable for all, including those with low incomes or limited digital literacy. There is also a need to ensure that these technologies are secure and that users' data is protected.

In this context, this paper aims to explore the role of FinTech in promoting financial inclusion. It will examine the various ways in which FinTech is being used to expand access to financial services, as well as the challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that these technologies benefit all segments of the population.

## 1.2. Problem Statement

Despite the potential of FinTech to promote financial inclusion, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the digital divide, which refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not. This divide can be based on factors such as income, education, age, and geographic location.

In many developing countries, for example, access to the internet and mobile phones is still limited, particularly in rural areas. This means that even if FinTech solutions are available, they may not be accessible to those who need them most. Additionally, even when technology is available, there may be barriers to adoption, such as lack of digital literacy or trust in digital financial services.

Another challenge is the regulatory environment. FinTech companies often operate in a regulatory gray area, which can create uncertainty and hinder innovation. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that these companies are subject to appropriate regulations to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.

Furthermore, there is a risk that FinTech could exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, if FinTech services are primarily targeted at urban, high-income populations, they may not benefit those who are most in need of financial inclusion. There is also a risk that FinTech could lead to the displacement of traditional financial institutions, which may have negative consequences for some segments of the population.

Given these challenges, it is important to understand how FinTech can be leveraged to promote financial inclusion in a way that is equitable and sustainable. This requires a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of FinTech for financial inclusion, including the types of services that are being offered, the populations that are being served, and the barriers to adoption.

This paper seeks to address these issues by examining the role of FinTech in promoting financial inclusion. It will explore the various ways in which FinTech is being used to expand access to financial services, as well as the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that these technologies benefit all segments of the population.
