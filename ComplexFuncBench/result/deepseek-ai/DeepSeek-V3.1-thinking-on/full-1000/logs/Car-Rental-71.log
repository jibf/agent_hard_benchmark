## 1.1. What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.

Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.

## 1.2. What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

## 1.3. What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse is a new, open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID transactions of data warehouses, enabling business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all data.

The data lakehouse is designed as a unified, simple architecture to support all data, analytics, and AI use cases. It eliminates the data silos that traditionally separate and complicate data engineering, data science, and machine learning.

## 1.4. What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale environments - within or across organizations.

A data mesh supports distributed, domain-specific data consumers and views data as a product, with each domain handling its own data pipelines. The four principles of the data mesh are:

- Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture
- Data as a product
- Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform
- Federated computational governance

## 1.5. What is a Data Fabric?

A data fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. It is a powerful architecture that standardizes data management practices and practicalities across cloud, on premises, and edge devices.

A data fabric is a data management design that enables an organization to transform its data landscape. It provides a unified, consistent user experience and access to data for any member of the organization, regardless of where the data resides. It is designed to help organizations solve complex data problems and use cases by providing a consistent set of data services and a common data model, which makes it easier to manage and use data across the organization.

## 1.6. What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.

Data pipelines are used to perform data integration. Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources and providing users with a unified view of them. The process of data integration involves data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.

## 1.7. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a type of data pipeline that extracts data from one or more sources, transforms the data, and loads the data into a destination system. The transformation step may involve cleaning, aggregating, and enriching the data.

## 1.8. What is ELT?

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. It is a type of data pipeline that extracts data from one or more sources, loads the data into a destination system, and then transforms the data. The transformation step may involve cleaning, aggregating, and enriching the data.

## 1.9. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. This data model is a conceptual representation of data objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules. Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. Data models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data.

## 1.10. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is a set of processes, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals. It defines who can take what action, upon what data, in what situations, using what methods. Data governance is a quality control discipline for adding new rigor and discipline to the process of managing, using, improving, and protecting organizational information.

## 1.11. What is Data Quality?

Data quality is the measure of how well suited a data set is to serve its specific purpose. Measures of data quality are based on data quality characteristics such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, and timeliness.

## 1.13. What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

## 1.14. What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources and providing users with a unified view of them. The process of data integration involves data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.

## 1.15. What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of selecting, preparing, extracting, and transforming data and permanently transferring it from one computer storage system to another. Additionally, the validation of migrated data for completeness and the decommissioning of legacy data storage are considered part of the entire data migration process.

## 1.16. What is Data Replication?

Data replication is the process of storing data in more than one site or node. It is useful in improving the availability of data. It is simply copying data from a database from one server to another server so that all the users can share the same data without any inconsistency.

## 1.17. What is Data Synchronization?

Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time. It is fundamental to a wide variety of applications, including file synchronization and mobile device synchronization.

## 1.18. What is Data Archiving?

Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to a separate storage device for long-term retention. Archive data consists of older data that is still important to the organization and may be needed for future reference, as well as data that must be retained for regulatory compliance.

## 1.19. What is Data Backup?

Data backup is the process of copying data from a primary location to a secondary location to protect it in case of a disaster, accident, or malicious action. Data is the lifeblood of modern organizations, and losing data can cause significant damage to the organization.

## 1.20. What is Data Recovery?

Data recovery is the process of salvaging data from damaged, failed, corrupted, or inaccessible secondary storage media when it cannot be accessed normally.
