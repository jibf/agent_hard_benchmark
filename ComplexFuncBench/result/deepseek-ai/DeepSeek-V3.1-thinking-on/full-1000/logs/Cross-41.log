## What is this course about?

This course is about the **fundamentals of programming** and **software development**. We will learn how to write code in the **Python** programming language, and how to use it to solve problems. We will also learn about the **tools** and **practices** that software developers use to write code, and how to use them to write better code.

## What will we learn?

We will learn about the following topics:

- **Programming fundamentals**: variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, etc.
- **Software development**: version control, testing, debugging, etc.
- **Python**: syntax, data structures, libraries, etc.
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, GitHub, etc.

## How will we learn?

We will learn through a combination of:

- **Lectures**: where we will learn about the theory behind programming and software development.
- **Exercises**: where we will practice writing code and solving problems.
- **Projects**: where we will apply what we have learned to build something useful.

## What do you need?

To follow this course, you will need:

- A **computer** with an internet connection.
- A **text editor** to write code. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
