2025-08-25 13:19:39,677 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-101 - INFO - Final Response: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.

## 1.2. What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.

## 1.3. What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

## 1.4. What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## 1.5. What is a bytecode?

Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

## 1.6. What is a token?

A token is a single element of a programming language. For example, the following line of code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

contains the following tokens:

- `print`
- `(`
- `"Hello, World!"`
- `)`

## 1.7. What is a lexer?

A lexer is a program that converts a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. The lexer is also known as a scanner.

## 1.8. What is a parser?

A parser is a program that converts a sequence of tokens into a parse tree. The parser is also known as a syntax analyzer.

## 1.9. What is a parse tree?

A parse tree is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The parse tree for the expression `1 + 2 * 3` is:

```
    +
   / \
  1   *
     / \
    2   3
```

## 1.10. What is an abstract syntax tree?

An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The AST for the expression `1 + 2 * 3` is:

```
    +
   / \
  1   *
     / \
    2   3
```

## 1.11. What is a symbol table?

A symbol table is a data structure used by a language translator such as a compiler or interpreter, where each identifier in a program's source code is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the source, such as its type, scope level, and sometimes its location.

## 1.12. What is a type system?

A type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components.

## 1.13. What is a type checker?

A type checker is a program that verifies that the types of expressions in a program are consistent with the type system of the programming language.

## 1.14. What is a code generator?

A code generator is a program that converts an intermediate representation of a program into a form that can be readily executed by a machine. The code generator may produce assembly language, object code, or another intermediate representation.

## 1.15. What is an optimizer?

An optimizer is a program that improves the efficiency of code without changing its meaning. The optimizer may perform transformations such as constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop unrolling.

## 1.16. What is a linker?

A linker is a program that combines object files into a single executable file. The linker resolves references between object files and libraries.

## 1.17. What is a loader?

A loader is a program that loads an executable file into memory and starts its execution.

## 1.18. What is a runtime system?

A runtime system is a software that provides services for a program while it is running. The runtime system may provide services such as memory management, garbage collection, and exception handling.

## 1.19. What is a garbage collector?

A garbage collector is a program that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the program.

## 1.20. What is a just-in-time compiler?

A just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that compiles code at runtime. The JIT compiler may compile code to native machine code to improve performance.

## 1.21. What is a transpiler?

A transpiler is a program that converts source code from one programming language to another. The transpiler may convert code from a high-level language to another high-level language, or from a high-level language to a low-level language.

## 1.22. What is a domain-specific language?

A domain-specific language (DSL) is a programming language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.

## 1.23. What is a general-purpose language?

A general-purpose language (GPL) is a programming language that is broadly applicable across domains. This is in contrast to a domain-specific language (DSL), which is specialized to a particular application domain.

## 1.24. What is a scripting language?

A scripting language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.

## 1.25. What is a systems programming language?

A systems programming language is a programming language used for system programming. System programming requires a great degree of hardware awareness and is often used to write operating systems, device drivers, and other low-level software.

## 1.26. What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or be more portable across platforms.

## 1.27. What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture. Low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware".

## 1.28. What is an assembly language?

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## 1.29. What is a machine language?

A machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.

## 1.30. What is a imperative programming language?

An imperative programming language is a programming language that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.

## 1.31. What is a declarative programming language?

A declarative programming language is a programming language that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program should accomplish, rather than how to go about accomplishing it.

## 1.32. What is a functional programming language?

A functional programming language is a programming language that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

## 1.33. What is a object-oriented programming language?

An object-oriented programming language is a programming language that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.

## 1.34. What is a procedural programming language?

A procedural programming language is a programming language that follows the procedural programming paradigm. The procedural programming paradigm is derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.

## 1.35. What is a logic programming language?

A logic programming language is a programming language that is based on formal logic. A program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.

## 1.36. What is a concurrent programming language?

A concurrent programming language is a programming language that has language constructs for concurrency. These constructs may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources, and futures and promises.

## 1.37. What is a parallel programming language?

A parallel programming language is a programming language that has language constructs for parallelism. These constructs may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources, and futures and promises.

## 1.38. What is a distributed programming language?

A distributed programming language is a programming language that has language constructs for distributed computing. These constructs may involve message passing, remote procedure calls, and distributed shared memory.

## 1.39. What is a embedded programming language?

An embedded programming language is a programming language that is designed for use in embedded systems. Embedded systems are computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints.

## 1.40. What is a real-time programming language?

A real-time programming language is a programming language that is designed for use in real-time computing. Real-time computing is the study of hardware and software systems that are subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from event to system response.
