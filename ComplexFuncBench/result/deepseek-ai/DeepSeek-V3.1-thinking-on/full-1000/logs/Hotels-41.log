2025-08-25 12:46:41,071 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-41 - INFO - Final Response: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># 1. Introduction

This document describes the design of a new API for the `java.util.regex`
package. The goal of this API is to provide a more modern and flexible API for
regular expressions that is better suited to the needs of modern Java
applications.

The new API is designed to be a replacement for the existing `java.util.regex`
API. It is not intended to be a complete rewrite of the existing API, but rather
a modernization of the existing API that provides a more flexible and powerful
API for regular expressions.

The new API is designed to be compatible with the existing API to the extent
possible. However, there are some changes that are necessary to provide a more
modern and flexible API. These changes are described in this document.

# 2. Motivation

The existing `java.util.regex` API has been largely unchanged since it was
introduced in Java 1.4. While it has served the Java community well, it has
some limitations that make it difficult to use in modern Java applications.

The existing API is based on the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes. The `Pattern`
class represents a compiled regular expression, and the `Matcher` class
represents the result of matching a regular expression against a character
sequence. The `Matcher` class provides methods for finding matches, replacing
matches, and splitting strings.

The existing API has several limitations:

- The `Matcher` class is stateful and not thread-safe. This makes it difficult
  to use in concurrent applications.
- The `Matcher` class is designed to be used with a single input string. This
  makes it difficult to use with streams or other sources of input.
- The `Matcher` class provides a limited set of operations. For example, it does
  not provide a way to iterate over all matches in a string.
- The `Matcher` class does not provide a way to access the groups of a match in
  a type-safe way.
- The `Matcher` class does not provide a way to access the start and end
  positions of groups in a match.
- The `Matcher` class does not provide a way to access the input string that was
  matched.
- The `Matcher` class does not provide a way to access the pattern that was
  used to match the input string.

The new API is designed to address these limitations by providing a more modern
and flexible API for regular expressions.

# 3. Description

The new API is based on the `Pattern` and `MatchResult` interfaces. The
`Pattern` interface represents a compiled regular expression, and the
`MatchResult` interface represents the result of matching a regular expression
against a character sequence.

The `Pattern` interface provides methods for compiling regular expressions and
for matching regular expressions against character sequences. The `MatchResult`
interface provides methods for accessing the groups of a match, the start and
end positions of groups, and the input string that was matched.

The new API also provides a `Matcher` class that implements the `MatchResult`
interface. The `Matcher` class is designed to be used with a single input
string, similar to the existing `Matcher` class. However, the new `Matcher`
class is immutable and thread-safe, and it provides a more flexible set of
operations.

The new API also provides a `Match` class that implements the `MatchResult`
interface. The `Match` class is designed to represent a single match in a
string. The `Match` class is immutable and thread-safe, and it provides a more
flexible set of operations.

The new API also provides a `MatchIterator` class that implements the
`Iterator<Match>` interface. The `MatchIterator` class is designed to iterate
over all matches in a string. The `MatchIterator` class is immutable and
thread-safe, and it provides a more flexible set of operations.

The new API also provides a `MatchStream` class that implements the
`Stream<Match>` interface. The `MatchStream` class is designed to stream over
all matches in a string. The `MatchStream` class is immutable and thread-safe,
and it provides a more flexible set of operations.

The new API also provides a `Group` class that represents a group in a match.
The `Group` class is immutable and thread-safe, and it provides methods for
accessing the group name, the group value, and the start and end positions of
the group.

The new API also provides a `Groups` class that represents the groups of a
match. The `Groups` class is immutable and thread-safe, and it provides methods
for accessing the groups by index or by name.

The new API also provides a `Regex` class that provides static methods for
compiling regular expressions and for matching regular expressions against
character sequences. The `Regex` class is designed to be a convenient entry
point for the new API.

The new API is designed to be compatible with the existing API to the extent
possible. However, there are some changes that are necessary to provide a more
modern and flexible API. These changes are described in the following sections.

## 3.1. Pattern Interface

The `Pattern` interface represents a compiled regular expression. The `Pattern`
interface provides methods for compiling regular expressions and for matching
regular expressions against character sequences.

The `Pattern` interface is defined as follows:

```java
public interface Pattern {
    static Pattern compile(String regex);
    static Pattern compile(String regex, int flags);
    static Pattern compile(String regex, Set<Flag> flags);
    
    String pattern();
    Set<Flag> flags();
    
    Matcher matcher(CharSequence input);
    Match match(CharSequence input);
    MatchIterator matchAll(CharSequence input);
    MatchStream matches(CharSequence input);
    
    String[] split(CharSequence input);
    String[] split(CharSequence input, int limit);
    
    String quote(String s);
    
    enum Flag {
        UNIX_LINES,
        CASE_INSENSITIVE,
        COMMENTS,
        MULTILINE,
        LITERAL,
        DOTALL,
        UNICODE_CASE,
        CANON_EQ,
        UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS
    }
}
```

The `Pattern` interface provides static methods for compiling regular
expressions. The `compile` methods take a regular expression string and an
optional set of flags, and return a `Pattern` object.

The `pattern` method returns the regular expression string that was used to
compile the pattern.

The `flags` method returns the set of flags that were used to compile the
pattern.

The `matcher` method returns a `Matcher` object that can be used to match the
pattern against a character sequence. The `Matcher` object is designed to be
used with a single input string.

The `match` method returns a `Match` object that represents the first match of
the pattern in the input string. If there is no match, the method returns
`null`.

The `matchAll` method returns a `MatchIterator` object that can be used to
iterate over all matches of the pattern in the input string.

The `matches` method returns a `MatchStream` object that can be used to stream
over all matches of the pattern in the input string.

The `split` method splits the input string around matches of the pattern. The
`split` method returns an array of strings. The `split` method with a limit
parameter limits the number of times the pattern is applied.

The `quote` method returns a literal pattern string for the specified string.

The `Flag` enum represents the flags that can be used to compile a regular
expression. The flags are the same as the flags in the existing `Pattern` class.

## 3.2. MatchResult Interface

The `MatchResult` interface represents the result of matching a regular
expression against a character sequence. The `MatchResult` interface provides
methods for accessing the groups of a match, the start and end positions of
groups, and the input string that was matched.

    int start(int group);
    int end(int group);
    String group(int group);
    
    int start(String group);
    int end(String group);
    String group(String group);
    
    Groups groups();
}
```

The `pattern` method returns the pattern that was used to match the input
string.

specified replacement string. The `replaceFirst` method with a function
parameter replaces the first match with the result of applying the function to
the match.

The `replaceAll` method replaces all matches in the input string with the
specified replacement string. The `replaceAll` method with a function parameter
replaces all matches with the result of applying the function to each match.
