# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose

This document is the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the project "The Game of Life" by Team 2. It describes the requirements for the implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of the project requirements for the development team and to serve as a reference for the testing team. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, user interface specifications, and other relevant details necessary for the successful implementation of the project.

## 1.2. Scope

The project involves developing a desktop application that simulates Conway's Game of Life. The application will allow users to:

- Create and edit initial configurations of cells
- Run the simulation with adjustable speed
- Pause and reset the simulation
- Save and load configurations
- View statistics about the current simulation

The application will be implemented in C++ using the Qt framework for the graphical user interface.

## 1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **Game of Life**: A cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.
- **Cell**: The basic unit of the Game of Life grid, which can be either alive or dead.
- **Generation**: A single iteration of the Game of Life rules applied to all cells in the grid.
- **Grid**: The two-dimensional array of cells that make up the Game of Life universe.
- **Pattern**: A specific configuration of alive and dead cells.
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification.

4. **Speed Adjustment**: Control the speed of the simulation through a slider or similar control.
5. **Pattern Management**: Save and load cell patterns from files.
6. **Statistics Display**: Show information about the current simulation, such as generation count and population.

**FR10: Speed Control**
- The system shall provide a control to adjust the simulation speed (generations per second).

### 3.1.4. Pattern Management

**FR11: Pattern Saving**
- The system shall allow users to save the current grid state to a file.

**FR12: Pattern Loading**
- The system shall allow users to load a previously saved pattern from a file.

**FR13: Predefined Patterns**
- The system shall include a library of common Game of Life patterns for quick insertion.

### 3.1.5. Statistics and Display

**FR14: Generation Counter**
- The system shall display the current generation number.

**FR15: Population Counter**
- The system shall display the current number of alive cells.

**FR16: Grid Display**
- The system shall display the grid with clear visual distinction between alive and dead cells.

**FR17: Visual Customization**
- The system shall allow users to customize the appearance of the grid (cell size, colors, etc.).

## 3.2. External Interface Requirements
