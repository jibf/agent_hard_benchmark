## 1.1. What is a component?

A component is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software. The component can be a single object, or a group of objects that work together. The component can be used by other components, or by an application.

## 1.2. What is a component model?

A component model is a set of rules that define how components are built and how they interact with each other. The component model defines the interface of the component, and how the component is packaged and deployed.

## 1.3. What is a component framework?

A component framework is a set of tools that help you build components that follow a component model. The framework provides the infrastructure that components need to run, and it provides tools to help you build and deploy components.

## 1.4. What is a component container?

A component container is a runtime environment that hosts components. The container provides the services that components need to run, such as security, transaction management, and persistence. The container also manages the lifecycle of components.

## 1.5. What is a component server?

A component server is a server that hosts components. The server provides the container that hosts the components, and it provides the services that components need to run.

## 1.6. What is a component client?

A component client is a program that uses components. The client can be a standalone program, or it can be a component itself.

## 1.7. What is a component assembly?

A component assembly is a set of components that are deployed together. The assembly can be a single component, or it can be a group of components that work together.

## 1.8. What is a component deployment?

A component deployment is the process of installing a component assembly into a component server. The deployment process includes installing the component assembly into the server, and configuring the server to host the components.

## 1.9. What is a component configuration?

A component configuration is a set of properties that define how a component behaves. The configuration can be set at deployment time, or it can be changed at runtime.

## 1.10. What is a component lifecycle?

A component lifecycle is the set of states that a component goes through from the time it is created to the time it is destroyed. The lifecycle includes states such as created, initialized, active, and destroyed.

## 1.11. What is a component transaction?

A component transaction is a set of operations that are performed as a single unit of work. The transaction is either committed or rolled back as a single unit.

## 1.12. What is a component security?

A component persistence is the ability of a component to store its state in a persistent store. The persistent store can be a database, a file system, or some other storage mechanism.

## 1.14. What is a component concurrency?

A component concurrency is the ability of a component to handle multiple requests at the same time. The component can be designed to handle multiple requests concurrently, or it can be designed to handle one request at a time.

## 1.15. What is a component scalability?

A component scalability is the ability of a component to handle an increasing number of requests. The component can be designed to handle more requests by adding more instances of the component, or by adding more resources to the component.

## 1.16. What is a component reliability?

A component reliability is the ability of a component to continue to function correctly in the face of failures. The component can be designed to handle failures by retrying operations, or by using redundant components.
