## 1.1. What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## 1.2. Why data structures?

Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. They are essential to the design of efficient algorithms. They are also used to store and organize data in a way that enables efficient access and modification.

## 1.3. Efficiency

The efficiency of a data structure is measured by the time and space complexity of its operations. Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. Space complexity is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

## 1.4. Cost of operations

The cost of an operation is the amount of time and space it requires. The cost of an operation depends on the data structure and the implementation of the operation.
