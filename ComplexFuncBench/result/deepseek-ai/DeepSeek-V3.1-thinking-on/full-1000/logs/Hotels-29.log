# 1. Introduction

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Neural Network-based Virtual Sensors with Confidence Bounds for HVAC System Variables". The paper is currently under review.

The paper proposes a method for estimating variables in HVAC systems using neural network-based virtual sensors. The method provides confidence bounds for the estimates, which are important for ensuring the reliability of the estimates.

The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for implementing the neural networks. The code also uses the scikit-learn library for data preprocessing and the matplotlib library for plotting the results.

# 2. Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your computer. The code was developed using Python 3.8.5. You also need to install the following Python libraries:

- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install torch scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas
```

# 3. Usage

The code is organized into several Python files:

- `data_loader.py`: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- `model.py`: Contains the definition of the neural network model.
- `train.py`: Contains functions for training the model.
- `test.py`: Contains functions for testing the model and generating the confidence bounds.
- `main.py`: The main script that ties everything together.

To run the code, you need to execute the `main.py` script. The script takes several command-line arguments:

- `--data_path`: The path to the data file. The data file should be a CSV file.
- `--output_path`: The path where the output plots will be saved.
- `--num_epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model (default: 100).
- `--batch_size`: The batch size for training (default: 32).
- `--learning_rate`: The learning rate for the optimizer (default: 0.001).

For example, to run the code with the default parameters, you can use the following command:

```
python main.py --data_path data.csv --output_path output/
```

# 4. Data Format

The data file should be a CSV file with the following columns:

- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the data point.
- `variable1`, `variable2`, ...: The variables that will be used as inputs to the virtual sensor.
- `target`: The variable that will be estimated by the virtual sensor.

The code assumes that the first column is the timestamp and the last column is the target variable. All other columns are used as input variables.

# 5. Output

The code will generate several plots in the output directory:

- `training_loss.png`: A plot of the training loss over epochs.
- `test_predictions.png`: A plot of the actual vs. predicted values for the test set.
- `confidence_bounds.png`: A plot of the confidence bounds for the estimates.

The code will also print the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions on the test set.

# 11. Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: The main script that loads the data, trains the model, and tests the model.
- `data_loader.py`: Contains the `DataLoader` class that handles loading and preprocessing the data.
- `model.py`: Contains the `NeuralNetwork` class that defines the neural network model.
- `train.py`: Contains the `Trainer` class that handles training the model.
- `test.py`: Contains the `Tester` class that handles testing the model and generating the confidence bounds.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for plotting and saving the results.

# 12. Detailed Description of the Code

## 12.1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The `DataLoader` class in `data_loader.py` is responsible for loading the data from the CSV file and preprocessing it. The preprocessing steps include:

- Normalizing the input and target variables to have zero mean and unit variance.
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Creating PyTorch datasets and data loaders for each set.

## 12.2. Neural Network Model

The `NeuralNetwork` class in `model.py` defines the neural network model. The model is a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers. The number of input neurons is equal to the number of input variables, and the number of output neurons is 1 (for estimating the target variable). The hidden layers have 64 and 32 neurons, respectively. The activation function used is the ReLU function.

## 12.3. Training

The `Trainer` class in `train.py` handles training the model. The training process uses the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training loop runs for a specified number of epochs, and the model with the lowest validation loss is saved.

## 12.4. Testing and Confidence Bounds

The `Tester` class in `test.py` handles testing the model and generating the confidence bounds. The confidence bounds are generated using a method called Monte Carlo dropout. During testing, dropout is enabled, and multiple forward passes are made for each input. The mean and standard deviation of the outputs are used to compute the confidence bounds.

## 12.5. Main Script

The `main.py` script ties everything together. It parses the command-line arguments, loads the data, trains the model, tests the model, and generates the plots.

# 13. Example

Here is an example of how to run the code with a sample data file:

```
python main.py --data_path sample_data.csv --output_path results/ --num_epochs 200 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 0.0005
```

This command will train the model for 200 epochs with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 0.0005. The results will be saved in the `results/` directory.

# 14. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the code, please check the following:

- Make sure that the data file exists and is in the correct format.
- Make sure that all required libraries are installed.
- Make sure that you have write permissions for the output directory.

If the problem persists, please contact the authors.

# 15. Future Work

The code can be extended in several ways:

- Support for different neural network architectures.
- Support for different methods for generating confidence bounds.
- Support for time-series data using recurrent neural networks.

We welcome contributions from the community.

# 16. Conclusion

This code provides a implementation of neural network-based virtual sensors with confidence bounds for HVAC system variables. We hope that this code will be useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of HVAC systems and virtual sensing.

Thank you for using our code!


# Neural Network-based Virtual Sensors with Confidence Bounds for HVAC System Variables

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Neural Network-based Virtual Sensors with Confidence Bounds for HVAC System Variables". The paper is currently under review.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your computer. The code was developed using Python 3.8.5. You also need to install the following Python libraries:

- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install torch scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas
```

## Usage

The code is organized into several Python files:

- `data_loader.py`: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- `model.py`: Contains the definition of the neural network model.
- `train.py`: Contains functions for training the model.
- `test.py`: Contains functions for testing the model and generating the confidence bounds.
- `main.py`: The main script that ties everything together.

To run the code, you need to execute the `main.py` script. The script takes several command-line arguments:

- `--data_path`: The path to the data file. The data file should be a CSV file.
- `--output_path`: The path where the output plots will be saved.
- `--num_epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model (default: 100).
- `--batch_size`: The batch size for training (default: 32).
- `--learning_rate`: The learning rate for the optimizer (default: 0.001).

For example, to run the code with the default parameters, you can use the following command:

```
python main.py --data_path data.csv --output_path output/
```

## Data Format

The data file should be a CSV file with the following columns:

- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the data point.
- `variable1`, `variable2`, ...: The variables that will be used as inputs to the virtual sensor.
- `target`: The variable that will be estimated by the virtual sensor.

The code assumes that the first column is the timestamp and the last column is the target variable. All other columns are used as input variables.

## Output

The code will generate several plots in the output directory:

- `training_loss.png`: A plot of the training loss over epochs.
- `test_predictions.png`: A plot of the actual vs. predicted values for the test set.
- `confidence_bounds.png`: A plot of the confidence bounds for the estimates.

The code will also print the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions on the test set.
