2025-08-25 11:36:46,668 - evaluation_logger_Cross-1 - INFO - Final Response: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># 1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

# A function is a block of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

# A method is a block of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:

# A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
# A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

# 2. How do you create a nested hash?

# A nested hash is a hash within a hash. You can create a nested hash by setting a key within a hash equal to another hash.

# 3. What is an example of a hash that you would use in a real program?

# A hash could be used to store a list of students and their grades. For example:

# grades = {
#   "John" => "A",
#   "Jane" => "B",
#   "Jim" => "C"
# }

# 4. What is the difference between a class and a module?

# A class is a blueprint for an object. It defines the attributes and methods that an object will have. A module is a collection of methods and constants. You can include a module in a class to give the class access to the methods and constants in the module.

# 5. Why do we use classes?

# We use classes to create objects. Objects are instances of a class. Classes allow us to create multiple objects that have the same attributes and methods.

# 6. What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?

# A local variable is a variable that is defined within a method and is only accessible within that method. An instance variable is a variable that is defined within a class and is accessible to all methods within that class.

# 7. What is an example of a class that you would use in a real program?

# A class could be used to represent a car. For example:

# class Car
#   def initialize(make, model, year)
#     @make = make
#     @model = model
#     @year = year
#   end

#   def start
#     puts "The car is starting."
#   end

#   def stop
#     puts "The car is stopping."
#   end
# end

# 8. What is the difference between an array and a hash?

# An array is an ordered list of elements. A hash is a collection of key-value pairs.

# 9. What is an example of an array that you would use in a real program?

# An array could be used to store a list of names. For example:

# names = ["John", "Jane", "Jim"]

# 10. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

# A symbol is a lightweight string. Symbols are immutable and are often used as keys in hashes. Strings are mutable and are often used to represent text.

# 11. What is an example of a symbol that you would use in a real program?

# A symbol could be used as a key in a hash. For example:

# person = {
#   :name => "John",
#   :age => 30
# }

# 12. What is the difference between a range and an array?

# A range is a sequence of values. An array is an ordered list of elements.

# 13. What is an example of a range that you would use in a real program?

# A range could be used to represent a range of numbers. For example:

# numbers = 1..10

# 14. What is the difference between a block and a method?

# A block is a piece of code that is passed to a method. A method is a block of code that is called by name.

# 15. What is an example of a block that you would use in a real program?

# A block could be used with the each method to iterate over an array. For example:

# [1, 2, 3].each do |number|
#   puts number
# end

# 16. What is the difference between a proc and a lambda?

# A proc is an object that contains a block of code. A lambda is a type of proc that has strict argument checking.

# 17. What is an example of a proc that you would use in a real program?

# A proc could be used to store a block of code that can be called later. For example:

# my_proc = Proc.new { |x| puts x }
# my_proc.call(5)

# 18. What is the difference between a module and a class?

# A module is a collection of methods and constants. A class is a blueprint for an object.

# 19. What is an example of a module that you would use in a real program?

# A module could be used to group together related methods. For example:

# module Math
#   def self.square(x)
#     x * x
#   end
# end

# 20. What is the difference between a public method and a private method?

# A public method is a method that can be called from outside the class. A private method is a method that can only be called from within the class.

# 21. What is an example of a public method that you would use in a real program?

# A public method could be used to provide access to an object's attributes. For example:

# class Person
#   attr_accessor :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end

# person = Person.new("John")
# puts person.name

# 22. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method?

# A class method is a method that is called on the class itself. An instance method is a method that is called on an instance of the class.

# 23. What is an example of a class method that you would use in a real program?

# A class method could be used to create a new instance of the class. For example:

# class Person
#   def self.create
#     new
#   end
# end

# person = Person.create

# 24. What is the difference between a constant and a variable?

# A constant is a value that cannot be changed. A variable is a value that can be changed.

# 25. What is an example of a constant that you would use in a real program?

# A constant could be used to store a value that should not change. For example:

# PI = 3.14159

# 26. What is the difference between a global variable and a local variable?

# A global variable is a variable that is accessible from anywhere in the program. A local variable is a variable that is only accessible within the scope in which it is defined.

# 27. What is an example of a global variable that you would use in a real program?

# A global variable could be used to store a value that needs to be accessed from multiple parts of the program. For example:

# $global_variable = 10

# 28. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?

# A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.

# 29. What is an example of a class variable that you would use in a real program?

# A class variable could be used to keep track of the number of instances of a class that have been created. For example:

# class Person
#   @@count = 0

#   def initialize
#     @@count += 1
#   end

#   def self.count
#     @@count
#   end
# end

# 30. What is the difference between a module and a mixin?

# A module is a collection of methods and constants. A mixin is a module that is included in a class to add functionality to the class.

# 31. What is an example of a mixin that you would use in a real program?

# A mixin could be used to add logging functionality to a class. For example:

# module Logging
#   def log(message)
#     puts message
#   end
# end

# class MyClass
#   include Logging
# end

# my_object = MyClass.new
# my_object.log("Hello, world!")

# 32. What is the difference between a getter and a setter?

# A getter is a method that returns the value of an instance variable. A setter is a method that sets the value of an instance variable.

# 33. What is an example of a getter that you would use in a real program?

# A getter could be used to provide access to an object's attributes. For example:

# class Person
#   attr_reader :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end

# person = Person.new("John")
# puts person.name

# 34. What is the difference between a class and an object?

# A class is a blueprint for an object. An object is an instance of a class.

# 35. What is an example of an object that you would use in a real program?

# An object could be used to represent a person. For example:

# class Person
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end
# end

# person = Person.new("John")

# 36. What is the difference between a method and a function?

# A method is a block of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. A function is a block of code that is called by name.

# 37. What is an example of a method that you would use in a real program?

# A method could be used to perform a specific task. For example:

# def greet(name)
#   puts "Hello, #{name}!"
# end

# greet("John")

# 38. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

# A parameter is a variable in a method definition. An argument is the value that is passed to the method when it is called.

# 39. What is an example of a parameter that you would use in a real program?

# A parameter could be used to pass data to a method. For example:

# def greet(name)
#   puts "Hello, #{name}!"
# end

# greet("John")

# 40. What is the difference between a return value and a side effect?

# A return value is the value that is returned by a method. A side effect is any change that a method makes to the state of the program.

# 41. What is an example of a return value that you would use in a real program?

# A return value could be used to return the result of a calculation. For example:

# def add(a, b)
#   a + b
# end

# result = add(2, 3)
# puts result

# 42. What is the difference between a loop and an iterator?

# A loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code. An iterator is a method that repeatedly yields values to a block.

# 43. What is an example of a loop that you would use in a real program?

# A loop could be used to iterate over an array. For example:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# for number in numbers
#   puts number
# end

# 44. What is the difference between a conditional and a case statement?

# A conditional is a control structure that executes a block of code if a condition is true. A case statement is a control structure that executes a block of code based on the value of an expression.

# 45. What is an example of a conditional that you would use in a real program?

# A conditional could be used to check if a number is even. For example:

# number = 4
# if number.even?
#   puts "The number is even."
# end

# 46. What is the difference between a while loop and an until loop?

# A while loop executes a block of code while a condition is true. An until loop executes a block of code until a condition is true.

# 47. What is an example of a while loop that you would use in a real program?

# A while loop could be used to count down from 10. For example:

# count = 10
# while count > 0
#   puts count
#   count -= 1
# end

# 48. What is the difference between a for loop and an each iterator?

# A for loop is a control structure that iterates over a range or array. An each iterator is a method that yields each element of a collection to a block.

# 49. What is an example of a for loop that you would use in a real program?

# A for loop could be used to iterate over an array. For example:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# for number in numbers
#   puts number
# end

# 50. What is the difference between a break and a next statement?

# A break statement exits a loop. A next statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

# 51. What is an example of a break statement that you would use in a real program?

# A break statement could be used to exit a loop when a condition is met. For example:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for number in numbers
#   break if number == 3
#   puts number
# end

# 52. What is the difference between a redo and a retry statement?

# A redo statement restarts the current iteration of a loop. A retry statement restarts the entire loop.

# 53. What is an example of a redo statement that you would use in a real program?

# A redo statement could be used to restart the current iteration if a condition is not met. For example:

# count = 0
# while count < 5
#   count += 1
#   redo if count == 3
#   puts count
# end

# 54. What is the difference between a raise and a rescue statement?

# A raise statement raises an exception. A rescue statement handles an exception.

# 55. What is an example of a raise statement that you would use in a real program?

# A raise statement could be used to raise an exception if an error occurs. For example:

# def divide(a, b)
#   raise "Division by zero" if b == 0
#   a / b
# end

# 56. What is the difference between a begin and an end block?

# A begin block is used to define a block of code that may raise an exception. An end block is used to end a begin block.

# 57. What is an example of a begin block that you would use in a real program?

# A begin block could be used to handle exceptions. For example:

# begin
#   result = divide(10, 0)
# rescue => e
#   puts e.message
# end

# 58. What is the difference between a ensure and a else clause?

# An ensure clause is executed whether or not an exception is raised. An else clause is executed if no exception is raised.

# 59. What is an example of an ensure clause that you would use in a real program?

# An ensure clause could be used to clean up resources. For example:

# begin
#   file = File.open("file.txt")
#   # do something with the file
# rescue => e
#   puts e.message
# ensure
#   file.close if file
# end

# 60. What is the difference between a throw and a catch statement?

# A throw statement transfers control to a catch statement. A catch statement catches a throw statement.

# 61. What is an example of a throw statement that you would use in a real program?

# A throw statement could be used to break out of nested loops. For example:

# catch :done do
#   while true
#     while true
#       throw :done
#     end
#   end
# end

# 62. What is the difference between a yield and a block_given? method?

# A yield statement yields control to a block. A block_given? method checks if a block was given to the method.

# 63. What is an example of a yield statement that you would use in a real program?

# A yield statement could be used to call a block. For example:

# def greet
#   yield
# end

# greet { puts "Hello, world!" }

# 64. What is the difference between a proc and a block?

# A proc is an object that contains a block of code. A block is a piece of code that is passed to a method.

# 65. What is an example of a proc that you would use in a real program?

# A proc could be used to store a block of code that can be called later. For example:

# my_proc = Proc.new { |x| puts x }
# my_proc.call(5)

# 66. What is the difference between a lambda and a proc?

# A lambda is a type of proc that has strict argument checking.

# 67. What is an example of a lambda that you would use in a real program?

# A lambda could be used to create a function that can be passed around. For example:

# my_lambda = lambda { |x| puts x }
# my_lambda.call(5)

# 68. What is the difference between a method and a proc?

# A method is a block of code that is called by name. A proc is an object that contains a block of code.

# 69. What is an example of a method that you would use in a real program?

# A method could be used to perform a specific task. For example:

# def greet(name)
#   puts "Hello, #{name}!"
# end

# greet("John")

# 70. What is the difference between a class and a module?

# A class is a blueprint for an object. A module is a collection of methods and constants.

# 71. What is an example of a class that you would use in a real program?

# A class could be used to represent a car. For example:

# class Car
#   def initialize(make, model, year)
#     @make = make
#     @model = model
#     @year = year
#   end

#   def start
#     puts "The car is starting."
#   end

#   def stop
#     puts "The car is stopping."
#   end
# end

# 72. What is the difference between a public method and a private method
