Abstract We utilise 3D design and 3D printing techniques to fabricate a number of miniaturised fluidic ‘reactionware’ devices for chemical syntheses in just a few hours, using inexpensive materials producing reliable and robust reactors. Both two and three inlet reactors could be assembled, as well as one-inlet devices with reactant ‘silos’ allowing the introduction of reactants during the fabrication process of the device. To demonstrate the utility of the devices we show the generation of the commonly used longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles and we compare the results with those obtained from the conventional batch synthesis. The 3D printed devices were also used to synthesise gold nanoparticles, producing a series of spherical gold nanoparticles with control over the size and size distribution.

1 Introduction  

The synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) has been a major area of research for many years, with a wide range of applications in fields such as catalysis, medicine, and electronics (Daniel and Astruc 2004; Burda et al. 2005; Xia et al. 2009). The synthesis of metallic NPs is often performed by the reduction of metal salts in the presence of a stabilising agent (e.g. citrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) (Turkevich et al. 1951; Frens 1973; Jana et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2006; Bastús et al. 2011). The use of microfluidic devices for the synthesis of NPs has been shown to have many advantages over traditional batch synthesis, including better control over the reaction conditions, and the ability to perform multiple reactions in parallel (Song et al. 2006; Marre and Jensen 2010; Nightingale and de Mello 2010; Nightingale et al. 2013). The use of microfluidic devices for the synthesis of silver and gold NPs has been demonstrated by a number of groups (Wagner and Köhler 2005; Duraiswamy and Khan 2009; Sebastian et al. 2010; Abou-Hassan et al. 2011; Song et al. 2011; Vasilescu et al. 2011). The majority of these devices are fabricated by soft lithography, which involves the fabrication of a master mould, followed by the casting of the device in a polymer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Xia and Whitesides 1998). This process is time consuming and requires access to clean room facilities, which can be expensive.  

We have recently demonstrated the use of 3D printing for the fabrication of reactionware devices for chemical synthesis (Symes et al. 2012; Kitson et al. 2012, 2013). The use of 3D printing allows the rapid fabrication of devices in a matter of hours, with no specialist facilities required. The devices are fabricated from polypropylene (PP), which is chemically resistant to a wide range of solvents and reagents, and the devices are robust and reusable. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of 3D printed microfluidic devices for the synthesis of silver and gold NPs. We show that the devices can be used to synthesise NPs with control over the size and size distribution, and that the devices can be used to perform multiple reactions in parallel.

2 Experimental

2.1 Materials

Silver nitrate (AgNO₃, 99 %), sodium borohydride (NaBH₄, 99 %), trisodium citrate (Na₃C₆H₅O₇, 99 %), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 10,000), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl₄·3H₂O, 99.9 %), and L-ascorbic acid (C₆H₈O₆, 99 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All solutions were prepared using deionised water (18.2 MΩ cm).

2.2 Device fabrication

The devices were designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional 2013 and fabricated using a ProJet HD 3000 3D printer (3D Systems) using VisiJet® EX200 plastic. The devices were printed with a layer thickness of 32 μm and a resolution of 750 × 750 × 890 DPI (x, y, z). The devices were printed with a support material (VisiJet® S300) which was removed by soaking in a 2 % (w/v) sodium hydroxide solution for 2 h, followed by rinsing with water and drying with compressed air. The devices were then sealed with a polypropylene (PP) film (Goodfellow, 0.05 mm thick) using a thermal laminator (GBC Creative Pro 35) at 120 °C. The devices were then connected to syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus PHD 2000) using PTFE tubing (0.8 mm ID, 1.6 mm OD) and luer lock fittings.

2.3 Synthesis of silver nanoparticles

The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was performed using a two-inlet device (Fig. 1a). The device has two inlets (A and B) and one outlet. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to two syringe pumps, one containing a solution of AgNO₃ (1 mM) and Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (1 mM) in water, and the other containing a solution of NaBH₄ (2 mM) in water. The flow rates were set to 50 μL min⁻¹ for both syringes, giving a total flow rate of 100 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-1800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-1200EX). For comparison, a batch synthesis was performed by adding 5 mL of NaBH₄ (2 mM) to 5 mL of AgNO₃ (1 mM) and Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (1 mM) in a vial with vigorous stirring. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before analysis.

2.4 Synthesis of gold nanoparticles

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was performed using a three-inlet device (Fig. 1b). The device has three inlets (A, B, and C) and one outlet. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to three syringe pumps, one containing a solution of HAuCl₄ (0.25 mM) and PVP (0.25 mM) in water, one containing a solution of Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (2.5 mM) in water, and one containing a solution of ascorbic acid (0.25 mM) in water. The flow rates were set to 50 μL min⁻¹ for all three syringes, giving a total flow rate of 150 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM. To investigate the effect of flow rate on the size of the gold nanoparticles, the flow rates were varied from 10 to 100 μL min⁻¹ for each syringe, giving total flow rates of 30–300 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet.

2.5 Synthesis of gold nanoparticles using a ‘silo’ device

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was also performed using a one-inlet device with a reactant ‘silo’ (Fig. 1c). The device has one inlet (A) and one outlet, with a ‘silo’ containing a solid reactant (ascorbic acid) incorporated into the device during the printing process. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to a syringe pump containing a solution of HAuCl₄ (0.25 mM) and PVP (0.25 mM) in water. The flow rate was set to 50 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM.

3.2 Synthesis of silver nanoparticles

The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was performed using a two-inlet device (Fig. 1a). The device has two inlets (A and B) and one outlet. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to two syringe pumps, one containing a solution of AgNO₃ (1 mM) and Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (1 mM) in water, and the other containing a solution of NaBH₄ (2 mM) in water. The flow rates were set to 50 μL min⁻¹ for both syringes, giving a total flow rate of 100 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM. For comparison, a batch synthesis was performed by adding 5 mL of NaBH₄ (2 mM) to 5 mL of AgNO₃ (1 mM) and Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (1 mM) in a vial with vigorous stirring. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before analysis.

The UV–Vis spectra of the products from the microfluidic and batch syntheses are shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum of the product from the microfluidic synthesis shows a peak at 395 nm, which is characteristic of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles (Evanoff and Chumanov 2005). The spectrum of the product from the batch synthesis shows a peak at 395 nm, but with a broader full width at half maximum (FWHM) than the microfluidic product, indicating a larger size distribution. The TEM images of the products are shown in Fig. 3. The microfluidic product consists of spherical nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 10.2 ± 2.1 nm (Fig. 3a), while the batch product consists of spherical nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 11.3 ± 3.5 nm (Fig. 3b). The size distributions are shown in Fig. 3c, d. The microfluidic product has a narrower size distribution than the batch product, which is consistent with the UV–Vis spectra.

3.3 Synthesis of gold nanoparticles

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was performed using a three-inlet device (Fig. 1b). The device has three inlets (A, B, and C) and one outlet. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to three syringe pumps, one containing a solution of HAuCl₄ (0.25 mM) and PVP (0.25 mM) in water, one containing a solution of Na₃C₆H₅O₇ (2.5 mM) in water, and one containing a solution of ascorbic acid (0.25 mM) in water. The flow rates were set to 50 μL min⁻¹ for all three syringes, giving a total flow rate of 150 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM. To investigate the effect of flow rate on the size of the gold nanoparticles, the flow rates were varied from 10 to 100 μL min⁻¹ for each syringe, giving total flow rates of 30–300 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet.

The UV–Vis spectra of the products from the microfluidic synthesis at different flow rates are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra show a peak at 520–530 nm, which is characteristic of the LSPR of gold nanoparticles (Jain et al. 2006). The peak position shifts to longer wavelengths as the flow rate decreases, indicating an increase in the size of the nanoparticles. The TEM images of the products are shown in Fig. 5. The nanoparticles are spherical, and the mean diameter increases from 9.2 ± 1.8 nm at 300 μL min⁻¹ to 16.3 ± 2.5 nm at 30 μL min⁻¹. The size distributions are shown in Fig. 5e. The size distribution becomes narrower as the flow rate increases, which is consistent with the UV–Vis spectra.

3.4 Synthesis of gold nanoparticles using a ‘silo’ device

The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was also performed using a one-inlet device with a reactant ‘silo’ (Fig. 1c). The device has one inlet (A) and one outlet, with a ‘silo’ containing a solid reactant (ascorbic acid) incorporated into the device during the printing process. The channel dimensions are 1 mm wide × 1 mm deep, and the total length of the channel is 100 mm. The device was connected to a syringe pump containing a solution of HAuCl₄ (0.25 mM) and PVP (0.25 mM) in water. The flow rate was set to 50 μL min⁻¹. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min before collecting the product at the outlet. The product was collected in a vial and analysed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM.

The UV–Vis spectrum of the product from the ‘silo’ device is shown in Fig. 6. The spectrum shows a peak at 530 nm, which is characteristic of the LSPR of gold nanoparticles. The TEM image of the product is shown in Fig. 6b. The nanoparticles are spherical with a mean diameter of 15
