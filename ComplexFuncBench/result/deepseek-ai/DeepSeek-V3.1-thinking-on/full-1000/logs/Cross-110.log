  - A variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

- **What is a data type?**
  - A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

- **What is a constant?**
  - A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution.

  - An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operations and produce final result.

- **What is an expression?**
  - An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions that are interpreted (evaluated) according to the particular rules of precedence and association for a particular programming language, which computes and then produces (returns, in a stateful environment) another value.

  - A return value is the value that a function returns to the calling code.

- **What is a comment?**
  - A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program.

- **What is a keyword?**
  - A keyword is a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning.

- **What is an identifier?**
  - An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects.

- **What is a literal?**
  - A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.

  - A string is a sequence of characters.

- **What is a number?**
  - A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label.

- **What is a boolean?**
  - A boolean is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false).

- **What is an array?**
  - An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

- **What is an object?**
  - An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.

- **What is a class?**
  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

- **What is a method?**
  - A method is a function that is associated with an object.

- **What is a property?**
  - A property is a characteristic of an object.

- **What is an event?**
  - An event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software.

- **What is a loop?**
  - A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

- **What is a condition?**
  - A condition is a boolean expression that is evaluated to determine whether a certain action should be taken.

- **What is a branch?**
  - A branch is a point in a program where the execution can take different paths depending on the value of a condition.

- **What is a bug?**
  - A bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

- **What is debugging?**
  - Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.

- **What is testing?**
  - Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.

- **What is a test case?**
  - A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

- **What is a test suite?**
  - A test suite is a collection of test cases that are intended to be used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviors.

- **What is a test plan?**
  - A test plan is a document detailing the objectives, resources, and processes for a specific test for a software or hardware product.

- **What is a test report?**
  - A test report is a document that summarizes the results of testing activities.

- **What is a requirement?**
  - A requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process must be able to perform.

- **What is a specification?**
  - A specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items, materials, or services.

- **What is a design?**
  - A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process.

- **What is an implementation?**
  - An implementation is the realization of an application, or execution of a plan, idea, model, design, specification, standard, algorithm, or policy.

- **What is a deployment?**
  - Deployment is the process of making a software system available for use.

- **What is maintenance?**
  - Maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.

- **What is a version?**
  - A version is a particular state of a software product.

- **What is a release?**
  - A release is the distribution of the final version of a software product.

- **What is a patch?**
  - A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it.

- **What is a feature?**
  - A feature is a distinct property or characteristic of a software item.
