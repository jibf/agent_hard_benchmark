## 1.1. What is a database?

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of information, and they are an essential component of many modern applications and systems.

There are many different types of databases, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are the most common type of database and are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.

Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including e-commerce websites, social media platforms, financial systems, and healthcare systems. They are also used in scientific research, government agencies, and many other fields.

In summary, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for efficient access and manipulation of that data.

## 1.2. What is a database management system?

A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that is used to manage and organize data in a database. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a structured and efficient manner.

A DBMS typically includes a set of tools and interfaces that allow users to interact with the database, such as a query language for retrieving data, a data definition language for defining the structure of the database, and a data manipulation language for modifying data.

Some common examples of DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and MongoDB. Each of these systems has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of applications and use cases.

Overall, a DBMS is an essential component of many modern applications and systems, as it provides a way to store and manage large amounts of data in a structured and efficient manner.

## 1.3. What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, each of which has a unique name and consists of rows and columns. The tables are related to each other through common fields, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

In a relational database, data is stored in a structured way, with each table representing a specific entity or concept, and each row representing a specific instance of that entity. The columns in the table represent the attributes or properties of the entity.

Relational databases are based on the relational model, which was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. The relational model is based on mathematical set theory and provides a way to represent data in a way that is both flexible and efficient.

Some of the key features of relational databases include:

- Data integrity: Relational databases enforce rules to ensure that data is accurate and consistent.
- Flexibility: Relational databases can be easily modified to accommodate changing requirements.
- Scalability: Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and can be scaled up or down as needed.
- Security: Relational databases provide mechanisms to control access to data and ensure that it is protected from unauthorized access.

Overall, relational databases are widely used in a variety of applications, from small personal databases to large enterprise systems. They are known for their reliability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## 1.4. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is a standard language for interacting with databases and is used by many database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

SQL allows users to perform a variety of operations on databases, including:

- Creating and modifying database structures, such as tables, indexes, and views.
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables.
- Querying data from one or more tables using SELECT statements.
- Controlling access to data by granting and revoking permissions.

SQL is a declarative language, which means that users specify what they want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. The database management system then determines the most efficient way to execute the query.

SQL is a powerful and flexible language that is essential for working with relational databases. It is used by developers, database administrators, and data analysts to manage and analyze data in a wide variety of applications.

## 1.5. What is a table?

In a relational database, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Each table has a unique name and represents a specific entity or concept, such as customers, orders, or products.

The columns in a table represent the attributes or properties of the entity, such as name, address, or price. Each column has a data type that defines the kind of data that can be stored in it, such as integer, string, or date.

The rows in a table represent individual instances of the entity, such as a specific customer or order. Each row has a unique identifier, called a primary key, that distinguishes it from other rows in the table.

Tables can be related to each other through common fields, such as a customer ID that appears in both the customers table and the orders table. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data across multiple tables.

Overall, tables are the fundamental building blocks of relational databases, and they provide a structured way to store and organize data.

## 1.6. What is a column?

In a relational database, a column is a vertical set of data values within a table that represents a specific attribute or property of the entity being stored. Each column has a name and a data type that defines the kind of data that can be stored in it.

For example, in a table of customers, there might be columns for customer ID, name, address, and phone number. The customer ID column might be an integer data type, while the name and address columns might be string data types.

Columns are used to define the structure of a table and to enforce data integrity rules. For example, a column might be defined as not null, which means that every row in the table must have a value for that column. Or, a column might be defined as unique, which means that no two rows can have the same value for that column.

Columns can also be used to create indexes, which can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort data based on that column.

Overall, columns are an essential part of relational databases, as they provide a way to define the structure of data and to enforce rules that ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## 1.7. What is a row?

In a relational database, a row is a horizontal set of data values within a table that represents a single instance of the entity being stored. Each row has a unique identifier, called a primary key, that distinguishes it from other rows in the table.

For example, in a table of customers, each row might represent a specific customer, with columns for customer ID, name, address, and phone number. The customer ID column would be the primary key, ensuring that each row has a unique identifier.

Rows are used to store actual data in the table. When data is inserted into a table, a new row is created with the values for each column. When data is updated, the values in the row are modified. When data is deleted, the row is removed from the table.

Rows can be related to rows in other tables through foreign keys, which are columns that reference the primary key of another table. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data across multiple tables.

Overall, rows are the fundamental unit of data storage in relational databases, and they provide a way to store and organize individual instances of entities.

## 1.8. What is a primary key?

In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and for establishing relationships between tables.

A primary key must satisfy the following conditions:

- It must contain unique values for each row in the table.
- It cannot contain null values.
- It must be stable, meaning that its value should not change over time.

Typically, a primary key is a single column, such as an auto-incrementing integer or a GUID. However, it can also be a combination of columns, known as a composite key, if no single column can uniquely identify each row.

Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity, which ensures that each row in the table represents a distinct entity. They are also used as the target of foreign key constraints, which establish relationships between tables.

For example, in a table of customers, the customer ID column might be the primary key. In a table of orders, there might be a foreign key column that references the customer ID column in the customers table, establishing a relationship between orders and customers.

Overall, primary keys are a critical component of relational databases, as they provide a way to uniquely identify rows and to establish relationships between tables.

## 1.9. What is a foreign key?

In a relational database, a foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing data to be linked across tables.

The table that contains the foreign key is called the child table, and the table that contains the primary key is called the parent table. The foreign key in the child table must match the primary key in the parent table, ensuring that each row in the child table corresponds to a row in the parent table.

Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that relationships between tables are maintained. For example, if a row in the parent table is deleted, any rows in the child table that reference that row must also be deleted or updated to reference a different row.

Foreign keys can also be used to create cascading updates and deletes, which automatically update or delete related rows in the child table when the corresponding row in the parent table is updated or deleted.

For example, in a database of customers and orders, the orders table might have a foreign key column that references the customer ID column in the customers table. This establishes a relationship between orders and customers, allowing you to retrieve all orders for a specific customer.

Overall, foreign keys are a powerful tool for establishing relationships between tables and for maintaining data integrity in relational databases.

## 1.10. What is a query?

In the context of databases, a query is a request for data or information from a database. Queries are used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data in a database.

The most common type of query is a SELECT statement, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. A SELECT statement specifies which columns to retrieve, which tables to retrieve them from, and any conditions that must be met for the data to be included in the result set.

For example, the following SQL query retrieves the names and email addresses of all customers who live in California:

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA';
```

Other types of queries include:

- INSERT statements, which are used to add new rows to a table.
- UPDATE statements, which are used to modify existing rows in a table.
- DELETE statements, which are used to remove rows from a table.

Queries can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements. They can involve multiple tables, complex conditions, and aggregations of data.

Overall, queries are a fundamental part of working with databases, as they provide a way to interact with the data and to retrieve the information that is needed.

## 1.11. What is a join?

In relational databases, a join is an operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, allowing you to combine information from different sources.

There are several types of joins, including:

- INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result will contain NULL values for the right table columns.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result will contain NULL values for the left table columns.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there is no match.

Joins are typically performed using the ON clause, which specifies the condition for matching rows between the tables. For example, the following SQL query uses an INNER JOIN to retrieve the names of customers and their orders:

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

This query combines data from the customers and orders tables based on the customer_id column, which is common to both tables.

Joins are a powerful feature of relational databases, as they allow you to combine data from multiple tables and to retrieve complex information in a single query.

## 1.12. What is a transaction?

In the context of databases, a transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must satisfy the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data integrity and reliability.

The ACID properties are:

- Atomicity: A transaction is atomic, meaning that it is either completed in its entirety or not at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged.
- Consistency: A transaction must leave the database in a consistent state. This means that all constraints, rules, and relationships must be maintained after the transaction is completed.
- Isolation: Transactions must be isolated from each other, meaning that the intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed.
- Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures.

Transactions are used to ensure that multiple operations are performed as a single unit, which is essential for maintaining data integrity in multi-user environments. For example, when transferring money between two bank accounts, both the debit and credit operations must be performed as a single transaction to ensure that the accounts remain balanced.

In SQL, transactions are typically started with the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement and ended with either COMMIT (to save the changes) or ROLLBACK (to undo the changes). For example:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

This transaction transfers $100 from account 1 to account 2. If either update fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and neither account is changed.

Overall, transactions are a critical feature of databases, as they ensure that data remains consistent and reliable even in the face of errors or system failures.

## 1.13. What is a view?

In relational databases, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. A view does not store data itself, but rather provides a way to present data from one or more tables in a specific way.

Views are useful for several reasons:

- Simplifying complex queries: Views can encapsulate complex joins, filters, and calculations, making it easier to work with the data.
- Restricting access to data: Views can be used to expose only certain columns or rows of a table, providing a level of security and privacy.
- Providing a consistent interface: Views can present data in a consistent format, even if the underlying table structure changes.

Views are created using the CREATE VIEW statement, which specifies the query that defines the view. For example, the following SQL statement creates a view that shows the names and email addresses of customers who live in California:

```sql
CREATE VIEW california_customers AS
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA';
```

Once created, a view can be queried like a regular table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM california_customers;
```

Views can also be updated, inserted into, or deleted from, depending on the complexity of the underlying query and the database management system.

Overall, views are a powerful tool for working with databases, as they provide a way to simplify complex queries, restrict access to data, and present data in a consistent format.

## 1.14. What is an index?

In relational databases, an index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. An index is created on one or more columns of a table, and it contains a sorted copy of the data in those columns, along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table.

Indexes are used to quickly locate and access specific rows in a table, without having to scan the entire table. This can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter, sort, or join data based on the indexed columns.

There are several types of indexes, including:

- B-tree indexes: The most common type of index, which stores data in a balanced tree structure. B-tree indexes are efficient for equality and range queries.
- Hash indexes: Indexes that use a hash function to map keys to specific locations. Hash indexes are very fast for equality queries but are not suitable for range queries.
- Bitmap indexes: Indexes that use bitmaps to represent the presence or absence of values. Bitmap indexes are efficient for low-cardinality columns (columns with few distinct values).

Indexes are created using the CREATE INDEX statement. For example, the following SQL statement creates an index on the email column of the customers table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email ON customers (email);
```

While indexes can improve query performance, they also have some drawbacks:

- They consume additional storage space.
- They slow down data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must be updated along with the table.
- They require maintenance to ensure that they remain efficient over time.

Therefore, indexes should be created judiciously, based on the specific query patterns and performance requirements of the application.

Overall, indexes are a critical tool for optimizing database performance, as they allow for fast data retrieval without having to scan entire tables.

## 1.15. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal of normalization is to minimize data duplication and ensure that data is stored in a logical and consistent manner.

Normalization is typically achieved by applying a series of rules, called normal forms, to the database design. The most common normal forms are:

- First Normal Form (1NF): Requires that each column contain atomic (indivisible) values, and that each row be uniquely identifiable.
- Second Normal Form (2NF): Requires that the table be in 1NF and that all non-key columns be fully dependent on the entire primary key.
- Third Normal Form (3NF): Requires that the table be in 2NF and that all non-key columns be independent of each other (i.e., there are no transitive dependencies).

There are also higher normal forms, such as Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and Fourth Normal Form (4NF), which address more complex dependency issues.

The benefits of normalization include:

- Reduced data redundancy: Data is stored in only one place, which saves storage space and reduces the risk of inconsistencies.
- Improved data integrity: With less redundancy, there is less chance of update anomalies (insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies).
- Simplified queries: Normalized tables are typically easier to query and maintain.

However, normalization can also have some drawbacks:

- Increased complexity: Normalized databases often have more tables and require more joins to retrieve data
