## 1.1. What is a database?

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of information, and they are an essential component of many software applications.

There are many different types of databases, but they can generally be categorized into two main types: relational databases and non-relational databases.

Relational databases are the most common type of database. They store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field within that record. Relational databases use a structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data.

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They do not use tables and rows like relational databases, but instead use other data models such as key-value pairs, document stores, or graph databases.

Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including e-commerce websites, social media platforms, financial systems, and more. They allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they provide a way to ensure data integrity and security.

## 1.2. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is a standard language used by most relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

SQL allows users to create, modify, and query databases. It provides a set of commands that can be used to perform various operations on the data stored in the database, such as inserting new records, updating existing records, deleting records, and retrieving data based on specific criteria.

SQL is a declarative language, which means that users specify what they want to do with the data, rather than how to do it. The database management system then takes care of the details of how to execute the query.

SQL is a powerful tool for working with databases, and it is widely used in the industry. It is an essential skill for anyone working with data, including data analysts, database administrators, and software developers.

## 1.3. What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and each row in the table represents a single instance of that entity. The columns in the table represent the attributes or properties of the entity.

Relational databases are based on the relational model, which was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. The relational model is based on the concept of relations, which are sets of tuples (rows) that have the same attributes (columns).

One of the key features of relational databases is that they allow for the establishment of relationships between tables. These relationships are defined by foreign keys, which are columns in one table that refer to the primary key of another table. This allows for data to be organized in a way that minimizes redundancy and ensures data integrity.

Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data. SQL provides a set of commands that can be used to create, modify, and query the database.

Relational databases are widely used in a variety of applications, including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and more. They are known for their reliability, scalability, and ability to handle complex queries.

## 1.4. What is a table?

In a relational database, a table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and each row in the table represents a single instance of that entity. The columns in the table represent the attributes or properties of the entity.

For example, consider a database for a library. One table might be called "Books", and it could have columns such as "Title", "Author", "ISBN", and "Publication Date". Each row in the table would represent a single book, with values for each of the columns.

Tables are the fundamental building blocks of relational databases. They allow for data to be organized in a structured way, which makes it easier to store, retrieve, and manipulate the data.

Tables can be related to each other through foreign keys, which are columns in one table that refer to the primary key of another table. This allows for data to be organized in a way that minimizes redundancy and ensures data integrity.

In SQL, tables are created using the CREATE TABLE statement, and data is inserted into tables using the INSERT statement. Tables can be queried using the SELECT statement, and they can be updated using the UPDATE statement.

## 1.5. What is a column?

In a relational database, a column is a set of data values of a particular type, one for each row in the table. Columns represent the attributes or properties of the entity that the table represents.

For example, in a table called "Employees", there might be columns such as "EmployeeID", "FirstName", "LastName", "Email", and "Salary". Each column has a specific data type, such as integer, string, or date, which defines the kind of data that can be stored in that column.

Columns are defined when a table is created, and they can be modified using ALTER TABLE statements. Each column has a name and a data type, and it may also have constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, or PRIMARY KEY.

Columns are used to organize and structure the data in a table. They allow for efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they provide a way to enforce data integrity by ensuring that only valid data is stored in the database.

In SQL, columns are referenced by their names when querying or updating data. For example, to retrieve the first names of all employees, you would use a SELECT statement that specifies the "FirstName" column.

## 1.6. What is a row?

In a relational database, a row (also known as a record or tuple) is a single entry in a table. Each row represents a complete set of data for the entity that the table represents, with values for each of the columns.

For example, in a table called "Employees", each row would represent a single employee. The row would contain values for each of the columns, such as the employee's ID, first name, last name, email, and salary.

Rows are the fundamental unit of data storage in a relational database. They allow for data to be organized in a structured way, with each row representing a distinct instance of the entity.

Rows can be inserted, updated, and deleted using SQL statements. When querying data, rows are returned as the result of a SELECT statement, with each row containing the values for the specified columns.

The number of rows in a table can vary over time as data is added, updated, or deleted. The primary key of a table is used to uniquely identify each row, ensuring that no two rows have the same values for the primary key columns.

## 1.7. What is a primary key?

A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key must contain unique values, and it cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key.

The primary key is used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table. It ensures that each row is uniquely identifiable, which is essential for establishing relationships between tables.

For example, in a table called "Employees", the "EmployeeID" column might be designated as the primary key. This means that each employee must have a unique ID, and no two employees can have the same ID.

Primary keys are often used as foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships. For example, a table called "Orders" might have a column called "EmployeeID" that references the "EmployeeID" column in the "Employees" table. This creates a relationship between the two tables, allowing you to associate orders with the employees who placed them.

In SQL, primary keys are defined when a table is created using the PRIMARY KEY constraint. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Primary keys can also be defined on multiple columns, known as a composite primary key. In this case, the combination of values in the columns must be unique.

## 1.8. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table. This creates a relationship between the two tables, allowing you to associate data across tables.

The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column of the referenced table. This prevents orphaned records and maintains consistency between related tables.

For example, consider two tables: "Orders" and "Customers". The "Orders" table has a column called "CustomerID" that is a foreign key referencing the "CustomerID" primary key in the "Customers" table. This relationship ensures that every order is associated with a valid customer.

In SQL, foreign keys are defined using the FOREIGN KEY constraint. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATE,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

Foreign keys can also be defined on multiple columns, known as a composite foreign key. In this case, the combination of values in the foreign key columns must match the combination of values in the primary key columns of the referenced table.

Foreign keys are essential for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables in a relational database.

## 1.9. What is a query?

A query is a request for data or information from a database. In SQL, queries are written using the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables. Queries can also be used to insert, update, or delete data.

The SELECT statement is the most commonly used SQL command for querying data. It allows you to specify which columns to retrieve, which tables to query, and any conditions for filtering the data.

For example, to retrieve all columns from a table called "Employees", you would write:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

To retrieve specific columns, you would list them after the SELECT keyword:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
```

You can also add conditions to filter the results using the WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

Queries can also involve joining multiple tables to combine data from different sources:

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
```

Queries are essential for interacting with databases, as they allow you to retrieve and manipulate data based on specific criteria.

## 1.10. What is a join?

A join is an SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, allowing you to combine information from different sources.

There are several types of joins:

1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
5. **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.

For example, to retrieve employee names along with their department names, you might use an INNER JOIN:

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
```

Joins are powerful tools for querying relational databases, as they allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on relationships.

## 1.11. What is a subquery?

A subquery (also known as an inner query or nested query) is a query within another SQL query. Subqueries are used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.

Subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, including the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses. They are enclosed in parentheses and can be correlated or non-correlated.

- **Non-correlated subquery**: The inner query is independent of the outer query and can be executed on its own.
- **Correlated subquery**: The inner query depends on the outer query for its values. It is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

For example, to find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary, you can use a subquery in the WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

Another example is using a subquery in the SELECT clause to include additional calculated data:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary, 
       (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees;
```

Subqueries can also be used in the FROM clause to create a derived table:

```sql
SELECT DeptID, AvgSalary
FROM (SELECT DepartmentID AS DeptID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
      FROM Employees
      GROUP BY DepartmentID) AS DeptAvg;
```

Subqueries are a powerful feature of SQL that allow for complex queries and data manipulation.

## 1.12. What is a view?

A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query. Unlike a physical table, a view does not store data itself; instead, it dynamically retrieves data from the underlying tables when queried. Views can simplify complex queries, provide a level of abstraction, and enhance security by restricting access to specific columns or rows.

Views are created using the CREATE VIEW statement and can be queried just like regular tables. For example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

Once created, you can query the view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeView;
```

Views can be used to:
- Simplify complex queries by encapsulating them in a view.
- Provide a consistent, simplified interface to users.
- Restrict access to sensitive data by exposing only necessary columns.
- Present aggregated or calculated data without storing it.

Views can be updated if they meet certain conditions (e.g., they must be based on a single table, not contain aggregates, etc.). However, updates to the view are reflected in the underlying tables.

For example, to update a view:

```sql
UPDATE EmployeeView SET LastName = 'Smith' WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

This update would modify the underlying "Employees" table.

Views are a valuable tool for managing and securing data in a database.

## 1.13. What is an index?

An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. Indexes are created on one or more columns of a table and provide a quick way to look up data without scanning the entire table. However, indexes also consume storage space and can slow down data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must be updated accordingly.

Indexes are particularly useful for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, or ORDER BY clauses. They work similarly to an index in a book, allowing the database to find data quickly without reading every page.

For example, to create an index on the "LastName" column of the "Employees" table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
```

You can also create composite indexes on multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_department ON Employees (LastName, DepartmentID);
```

Indexes can be unique, ensuring that all values in the indexed column(s) are distinct:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON Employees (Email);
```

While indexes improve query performance, they should be used judiciously. Over-indexing can lead to increased storage requirements and slower write operations. It's important to analyze query patterns and create indexes only on columns that are frequently searched or sorted.

In SQL, indexes are managed using CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, and ALTER INDEX statements.

## 1.14. What is a transaction?

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that all operations within the unit are completed successfully; otherwise, none of the operations are applied. This maintains the consistency and integrity of the database.

Transactions follow the ACID properties:
- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none are.
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent.

In SQL, transactions are managed using the following commands:
- **BEGIN TRANSACTION** or **START TRANSACTION**: Marks the start of a transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes all changes made during the transaction if an error occurs.

For example, transferring money between two accounts:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;

COMMIT;
```

If any operation fails, you can roll back the entire transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
-- If an error occurs here:
ROLLBACK;
```

Transactions are essential for ensuring data integrity, especially in applications involving financial operations, inventory management, or any scenario where multiple related changes must be atomic.

## 1.15. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to minimize duplicate data and ensure that data is stored logically.

Normalization is typically done through a series of normal forms (NF), each with specific rules:
1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values and that each row is unique.
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Builds on 1NF by ensuring that all non-key columns are fully dependent on the entire primary key.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Builds on 2NF by ensuring that all non-key columns are independent of each other (no transitive dependencies).
4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stronger version of 3NF that addresses certain anomalies not covered by 3NF.
