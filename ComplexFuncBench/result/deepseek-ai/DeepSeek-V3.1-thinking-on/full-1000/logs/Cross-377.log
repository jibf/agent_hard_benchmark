# Abstract

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanovesicles that are shed by cells into the extracellular space and have been found to be potential biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, the isolation of EVs from whole blood remains a major challenge due to their small size and low abundance. Here, we present a 3D-printed microfluidic device for automated, point-of-care extraction of EVs from whole blood. The device consists of two modules: a blood filtration module for the separation of blood cells and a EV capture module for the isolation of EVs. The blood filtration module is composed of a 3D-printed housing and a commercially available polyethersulfone (PES) membrane, which can effectively separate blood cells from plasma. The EV capture module is composed of a 3D-printed chaotic mixer and a ZnO nanowire (NW) array-coated substrate, which can efficiently capture EVs from plasma. The device is automated by a programmable syringe pump, which can control the flow rate and volume of the sample and buffer. The device can process 500 µL of whole blood in 30 min and achieve a recovery rate of 80% for EVs. The isolated EVs are of high purity and integrity, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blotting. The device is simple, low-cost, and easy to use, making it suitable for point-of-care testing (POCT) of EVs.

# Introduction

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanovesicles that are shed by cells into the extracellular space and have been found to be potential biomarkers for a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease\(^1\). EVs are typically 30–1000 nm in diameter and contain a variety of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can be used to diagnose and monitor disease progression\(^2\). However, the isolation of EVs from whole blood remains a major challenge due to their small size and low abundance. Current methods for EV isolation include ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture\(^3\). These methods are time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and are not suitable for point-of-care testing (POCT).

Microfluidic devices have emerged as a promising platform for EV isolation due to their ability to handle small volumes of sample, high surface-to-volume ratio, and precise control of fluid flow\(^4\). Several microfluidic devices have been developed for EV isolation, including those based on size-based separation\(^5\), immunoaffinity capture\(^6\), and acoustophoresis\(^7\). However, these devices are typically fabricated using soft lithography, which is a time-consuming and expensive process. Furthermore, these devices are not automated and require manual operation, which limits their use in POCT.

3D printing is an emerging technology that has been used to fabricate microfluidic devices with complex geometries and integrated functionalities\(^8\). 3D printing offers several advantages over traditional fabrication methods, including rapid prototyping, low cost, and the ability to integrate multiple components into a single device\(^9\). Several 3D-printed microfluidic devices have been developed for EV isolation, including those based on size-based separation\(^10\), immunoaffinity capture\(^11\), and acoustophoresis\(^12\). However, these devices are typically not automated and require manual operation, which limits their use in POCT.

## Results

### Design and fabrication of the 3D-printed microfluidic device

The 3D-printed microfluidic device for automated, point-of-care extraction of EVs from whole blood is shown in Fig. 1. The device consists of two modules: a blood filtration module and a EV capture module. The blood filtration module is composed of a 3D-printed housing and a commercially available polyethersulfone (PES) membrane (Fig. 1a). The housing is designed to hold the PES membrane in place and to provide a seal between the membrane and the housing. The housing is printed using a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer (Form 2, Formlabs) with a clear resin (Formlabs Clear Resin). The PES membrane (Sterlitech) has a pore size of 0.2 µm and a diameter of 13 mm. The blood filtration module is connected to the EV capture module via a 3D-printed connector (Fig. 1b). The connector is printed using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer (Ultimaker 3) with polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The EV capture module is composed of a 3D-printed chaotic mixer and a ZnO nanowire (NW) array-coated substrate (Fig. 1c). The chaotic mixer is designed to enhance the mixing of the sample and buffer, which improves the efficiency of EV capture. The chaotic mixer is printed using a SLA 3D printer with a clear resin. The ZnO NW array-coated substrate is fabricated by growing ZnO NWs on a glass substrate using a hydrothermal method\(^{13}\). The ZnO NW array has a high surface-to-volume ratio and a high affinity for EVs, which enables efficient capture of EVs from plasma\(^{14}\). The EV capture module is connected to the syringe pump via a 3D-printed connector (Fig. 1d). The connector is printed using a FDM 3D printer with PLA filament. The entire device is automated by a programmable syringe pump (NE-1000, New Era Pump Systems), which can control the flow rate and volume of the sample and buffer.

### Performance of the blood filtration module

The performance of the blood filtration module was evaluated by filtering whole blood through the PES membrane. Whole blood was collected from healthy donors and anticoagulated with EDTA. 500 µL of whole blood was loaded into the blood filtration module and filtered at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The filtrate was collected and analyzed for the presence of blood cells using a hemocytometer. The results showed that the

Page 3/25

blood filtration module effectively separated blood cells from plasma, with a recovery rate of 95% for plasma (Fig. 2a). The filtrate was also analyzed for the presence of EVs using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The results showed that the filtrate contained EVs with a size distribution of 30–200 nm (Fig. 2b), which is consistent with the size range of EVs\(^{15}\). The concentration of EVs in the filtrate was \(1.2 \times 10^9\) particles/mL, which is similar to the concentration of EVs in plasma reported in the literature\(^{16}\).

## Performance of the EV capture module

The performance of the EV capture module was evaluated by capturing EVs from plasma using the ZnO NW array-coated substrate. Plasma was collected from healthy donors and spiked with fluorescently labeled EVs. The spiked plasma was loaded into the EV capture module and flowed through the chaotic mixer and the ZnO NW array-coated substrate at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The captured EVs were then eluted from the substrate using a low-pH buffer and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that the EV capture module efficiently captured EVs from plasma, with a capture efficiency of 80% (Fig. 3a). The captured EVs were also analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the captured EVs were intact and had a size distribution of 30–200 nm (Fig. 3b), which is consistent with the size range of EVs\(^{15}\). The captured EVs were also analyzed using western blotting for the presence of EV markers, including CD63, CD81, and TSG101. The results showed that the captured EVs expressed these markers (Fig. 3c), confirming that the captured vesicles are indeed EVs.

## Performance of the integrated device

The performance of the integrated device was evaluated by extracting EVs from whole blood. Whole blood was collected from healthy donors and anticoagulated with EDTA. 500 µL of whole blood was loaded into the blood filtration module and filtered at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The filtrate was then loaded into the EV capture module and flowed through the chaotic mixer and the ZnO NW array-coated substrate at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The captured EVs were then eluted from the substrate using a low-pH buffer and analyzed using NTA. The results showed that the integrated device efficiently extracted EVs from whole blood, with a recovery rate of 80% for EVs (Fig. 4a). The extracted EVs were also analyzed using TEM. The results showed that the extracted EVs were intact and had a size distribution of 30–200 nm (Fig. 4b), which is consistent with the size range of EVs\(^{15}\). The extracted EVs were also analyzed using western blotting for the presence of EV markers, including CD63, CD81, and TSG101. The results showed that the extracted EVs expressed these markers (Fig. 4c), confirming that the extracted vesicles are indeed EVs.

## Discussion

We have developed a 3D-printed microfluidic device for automated, point-of-care extraction of EVs from whole blood. The device consists of two modules: a blood filtration module for the separation of blood cells and a EV capture module for the isolation of EVs. The blood filtration module is composed of a 3D-printed housing and a commercially available PES membrane, which can effectively separate blood cells from plasma. The EV capture module is composed of a 3D-printed chaotic mixer and a ZnO NW array-coated

substrate, which can efficiently capture EVs from plasma. The device is automated by a programmable syringe pump, which can control the flow rate and volume of the sample and buffer. The device can process 500 µL of whole blood in 30 min and achieve a recovery rate of 80% for EVs. The isolated EVs are of high purity and integrity, as confirmed by TEM, NTA, and western blotting.

The blood filtration module is designed to separate blood cells from plasma. The PES membrane has a pore size of 0.2 µm, which is small enough to retain blood cells but large enough to allow EVs to pass through. The blood filtration module is simple and low-cost, and it can be easily integrated with the EV capture module. The EV capture module is designed to capture EVs from plasma. The chaotic mixer enhances the mixing of the sample and buffer, which improves the efficiency of EV capture. The ZnO NW array-coated substrate has a high surface-to-volume ratio and a high affinity for EVs, which enables efficient capture of EVs from plasma. The EV capture module is also simple and low-cost, and it can be easily integrated with the blood filtration module.

The device is automated by a programmable syringe pump, which can control the flow rate and volume of the sample and buffer. The automation of the device makes it easy to use and suitable for POCT. The device can process 500 µL of whole blood in 30 min, which is faster than traditional methods for EV isolation, such as ultracentrifugation, which can take several hours\(^3\). The device also achieves a recovery rate of 80% for EVs, which is higher than that of traditional methods, such as ultracentrifugation, which typically has a recovery rate of 5–25%\(^3\).

The isolated EVs are of high purity and integrity, as confirmed by TEM, NTA, and western blotting. TEM showed that the isolated EVs are intact and have a size distribution of 30–200 nm, which is consistent with the size range of EVs\(^15\). NTA showed that the concentration of isolated EVs is \(1.2 \times 10^9\) particles/mL, which is similar to the concentration of EVs in plasma reported in the literature\(^16\). Western blotting showed that the isolated EVs express EV markers, including CD63, CD81, and TSG101, confirming that the isolated vesicles are indeed EVs.

In conclusion, we have developed a 3D-printed microfluidic device for automated, point-of-care extraction of EVs from whole blood. The device is simple, low-cost, and easy to use, making it suitable for POCT of EVs. The device can process 500 µL of whole blood in 30 min and achieve a recovery rate of 80% for EVs. The isolated EVs are of high purity and integrity, as confirmed by TEM, NTA, and western blotting. The device has the potential to be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease.

## Methods

### Fabrication of the 3D-printed microfluidic device

The 3D-printed microfluidic device was designed using SolidWorks (Dassault Systèmes) and fabricated using a combination of SLA and FDM 3D printing. The blood filtration module was printed using a SLA 3D

Page 5/25

printer (Form 2, Formlabs) with a clear resin (Formlabs Clear Resin). The EV capture module was printed using a SLA 3D printer with a clear resin. The connectors were printed using a FDM 3D printer (Ultimaker 3) with PLA filament. The PES membrane (Sterlitech) was cut to size and inserted into the blood filtration module. The ZnO NW array-coated substrate was fabricated by growing ZnO NWs on a glass substrate using a hydrothermal method\(^{13}\). The substrate was then inserted into the EV capture module.

## Preparation of whole blood and plasma

Whole blood was collected from healthy donors and anticoagulated with EDTA. Plasma was prepared by centrifuging whole blood at 2000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C until use.

## Preparation of fluorescently labeled EVs

EVs were isolated from plasma using ultracentrifugation\(^{17}\). Briefly, plasma was centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells and debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove larger vesicles. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 70 min at 4°C to pellet EVs. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at -80°C until use. EVs were labeled with a fluorescent dye (PKH67, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## Performance evaluation of the blood filtration module

500 µL of whole blood was loaded into the blood filtration module and filtered at a flow rate of 10 µL/min using a syringe pump (NE-1000, New Era Pump Systems). The filtrate was collected and analyzed for the presence of blood cells using a hemocytometer. The filtrate was also analyzed for the presence of EVs using NTA (NanoSight NS300, Malvern Panalytical).

## Performance evaluation of the EV capture module

Plasma was spiked with fluorescently labeled EVs and loaded into the EV capture module. The sample was flowed through the chaotic mixer and the ZnO NW array-coated substrate at a flow rate of 10 µL/min using a syringe pump. The captured EVs were then eluted from the substrate using a low-pH buffer (0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5) and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon). The capture efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the number of captured EVs to the number of input EVs. The captured EVs were also analyzed using TEM (JEM-1400, JEOL) and western blotting.

## Performance evaluation of the integrated device

500 µL of whole blood was loaded into the blood filtration module and filtered at a flow rate of 10 µL/min using a syringe pump. The filtrate was then loaded into the EV capture module and flowed through the chaotic mixer and the ZnO NW array-coated substrate at a flow rate of 10 µL/min using a syringe pump.

The captured EVs were then eluted from the substrate using a low-pH buffer and analyzed using NTA. The recovery rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of extracted EVs to the number of EVs in the filtrate. The extracted EVs were also analyzed using TEM and western blotting.

## Western blotting

EVs were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with antibodies against CD63 (Abcam), CD81 (Abcam), and TSG101 (Abcam). The membrane was then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

## Statistical analysis

All experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
