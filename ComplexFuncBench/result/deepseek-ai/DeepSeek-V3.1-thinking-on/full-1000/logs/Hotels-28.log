2025-08-25 12:42:53,785 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-28 - INFO - Final Response: <｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># 1. Introduction

This document describes the design and implementation of a program that
simulates a simple computer system. The system consists of a CPU and a
memory. The CPU has a set of registers and an ALU. The memory is a
linear array of bytes. The CPU can execute instructions that are stored
in memory. The instructions are encoded as bytes. The CPU can also
access memory to read and write data.

The program is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework for the GUI.
The GUI displays the state of the CPU and memory, and allows the user
to step through the execution of the program.

# 2. Design

## 2.1. CPU

The CPU has the following registers:

- `PC`: program counter, points to the next instruction to execute
- `SP`: stack pointer, points to the top of the stack
- `A`: accumulator, used for arithmetic operations
- `B`: general purpose register
- `C`: general purpose register
- `D`: general purpose register

The CPU also has an ALU that can perform the following operations:

- `ADD`: add two numbers
- `SUB`: subtract two numbers
- `MUL`: multiply two numbers
- `DIV`: divide two numbers
- `AND`: bitwise and
- `OR`: bitwise or
- `XOR`: bitwise xor
- `NOT`: bitwise not
- `SHL`: shift left
- `SHR`: shift right

The CPU can execute the following instructions:

- `NOP`: no operation
- `HALT`: halt the CPU
- `LOAD`: load a value from memory into a register
- `STORE`: store a value from a register into memory
- `PUSH`: push a value onto the stack
- `POP`: pop a value from the stack
- `JMP`: jump to an address
- `JZ`: jump if zero
- `JNZ`: jump if not zero
- `CALL`: call a subroutine
- `RET`: return from subroutine
- `INC`: increment a register
- `DEC`: decrement a register
- `ADD`: add two registers
- `SUB`: subtract two registers
- `MUL`: multiply two registers
- `DIV`: divide two registers
- `AND`: bitwise and two registers
- `OR`: bitwise or two registers
- `XOR`: bitwise xor two registers
- `NOT`: bitwise not a register
- `SHL`: shift left a register
- `SHR`: shift right a register

The instructions are encoded as bytes. The first byte of an instruction
is the opcode. The opcode is followed by zero or more operands. The
operands are either registers or immediate values.

## 2.2. Memory

The memory is a linear array of bytes. The memory is divided into two
sections: code and data. The code section starts at address 0 and
contains the instructions to execute. The data section starts at
address 0x1000 and contains the data. The stack starts at address
0x2000 and grows downwards.

## 2.3. GUI

The GUI displays the state of the CPU and memory. The CPU state is
displayed as a table of registers. The memory is displayed as a hex
dump. The user can step through the execution of the program by
clicking a button. The user can also set breakpoints by clicking on
memory addresses.

# 3. Implementation

## 3.1. CPU

The CPU is implemented as a class. The class has member variables for
the registers and the ALU. The class also has a member variable for the
memory. The class has a method to execute one instruction. The method
reads the opcode from memory at the address pointed to by the PC
register. It then decodes the opcode and executes the instruction.

## 3.2. Memory

The memory is implemented as a class. The class has a member variable
for the memory array. The class has methods to read and write bytes,
words, and double words. The class also has a method to load a program
from a file.

## 3.3. GUI

The GUI is implemented using Qt. The main window has a table widget for
the CPU registers, a text edit for the memory hex dump, and a button to
step through the program. The memory hex dump is updated after each
instruction is executed. The user can set breakpoints by clicking on
memory addresses in the hex dump. When a breakpoint is hit, the program
stops and the user can inspect the state of the CPU and memory.

# 4. Conclusion

The program simulates a simple computer system. The system consists of
a CPU and a memory. The CPU can execute instructions that are stored in
memory. The program is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework for the
GUI. The GUI displays the state of the CPU and memory, and allows the
user to step through the execution of the program.

# 5. Future Work

The program could be extended to support more instructions and more
complex addressing modes. The GUI could be improved to allow the user
to edit the memory and registers. The program could also be extended to
support interrupts and I/O devices.

## 7.1. Instruction Set

| Opcode | Instruction | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 0x00   | NOP         | No operation |
| 0x01   | HALT        | Halt the CPU |
| 0x02   | LOAD        | Load a value from memory into a register |
| 0x03   | STORE       | Store a value from a register into memory |
| 0x04   | PUSH        | Push a value onto the stack |
| 0x05   | POP         | Pop a value from the stack |
| 0x06   | JMP         | Jump to an address |
| 0x07   | JZ          | Jump if zero |
| 0x08   | JNZ         | Jump if not zero |
| 0x09   | CALL        | Call a subroutine |
| 0x0A   | RET         | Return from subroutine |

| 0x10   | DIV         | Divide two registers |
| 0x11   | AND         | Bitwise and two registers |
| 0x12   | OR          | Bitwise or two registers |
| 0x13   | XOR         | Bitwise xor two registers |
| 0x14   | NOT         | Bitwise not a register |
| 0x15   | SHL         | Shift left a register |
| 0x16   | SHR         | Shift right a register |

## 7.2. Instruction Encoding

The instructions are encoded as bytes. The first byte is the opcode.
The opcode is followed by zero or more operands. The operands are
either registers or immediate values.

The registers are encoded as follows:

| Register | Encoding |
|----------|----------|
| A        | 0x00     |
| B        | 0x01     |
| C        | 0x02     |
| D        | 0x03     |
| PC       | 0x04     |
| SP       | 0x05     |

Immediate values are encoded as little-endian bytes. For example, the
value 0x1234 is encoded as 0x34 0x12.

## 7.3. Example Program

The following program adds two numbers and stores the result in memory.

```
LOAD A, 0x1000   ; load first number from memory
LOAD B, 0x1001   ; load second number from memory
ADD A, B         ; add the numbers
STORE A, 0x1002  ; store the result in memory
HALT             ; halt the CPU
```

The program is encoded as:

```
0x02 0x00 0x00 0x10 0x00   ; LOAD A, 0x1000
0x02 0x01 0x01 0x10 0x00   ; LOAD B, 0x1001
0x0D 0x00 0x01             ; ADD A, B
0x03 0x00 0x02 0x10 0x00   ; STORE A, 0x1002
0x01                       ; HALT
```
