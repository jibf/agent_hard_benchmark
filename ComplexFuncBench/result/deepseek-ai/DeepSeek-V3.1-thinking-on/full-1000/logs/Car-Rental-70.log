## 1.1. What is the purpose of this document?

This document is a guide to the use of the **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)** for the C++ programming language. It is intended to be a reference for the C++ programmer who wants to use GCC to compile C++ programs. It is not a tutorial on C++ programming, nor is it a reference for the C++ language itself.

## 1.2. What is GCC?

GCC is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most Unix-like operating systems. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.

## 1.3. What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.

## 1.4. What is the relationship between GCC and C++?

GCC supports C++ as one of its languages. The C++ compiler in GCC is called `g++`. It is a front-end to GCC that compiles C++ source code into assembly language, which is then assembled into object code by the GNU assembler, and then linked into an executable by the GNU linker.

## 1.5. What is the relationship between GCC and the C++ standard?

GCC supports the C++ standard. The C++ standard is a set of rules that define the C++ language. The current C++ standard is C++17, which was published in 2017. GCC supports C++17, as well as previous standards such as C++14, C++11, and C++98. GCC also supports some features of the upcoming C++20 standard.

## 1.6. What is the relationship between GCC and the C++ standard library?
