We also do not tolerate any rude behavior towards staff members, especially when it is a reaction to a mistake made on the guest's part. Lastly, we offer an emergency line that is clearly advertised throughout the hostel so that you can call with any issues outside our operating hours.

## 1.1. What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data structures as:

- Mathematical/logical models or abstract data types (ADTs)
- Implementation

## 1.2. What is an abstract data type (ADT)?

An ADT is a mathematical model of a data structure that specifies:

- The type of data stored
- The operations supported on them
- The types of parameters of the operations

An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it.

An ADT is a language-independent and implementation-independent.

## 1.3. What is data structure implementation?

We need to implement an ADT in a programming language.

We need to choose:

- How to store the data
- Algorithms to support the operations

## 1.4. Why are there so many data structures?

Each data structure is designed to support some operations efficiently.

No data structure supports all operations efficiently.

We need to choose the data structure that is efficient for the operations we need.

## 1.5. What are the most common data structures?

- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Heaps
- Hash tables
- Graphs

## 1.6. What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

An algorithm is a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem.

## 1.7. What is a computational problem?

A computational problem specifies an input-output relationship.

Example: Sorting problem

- Input: A sequence of n numbers
- Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence such that a1' <= a2' <= ... <= an'

## 1.8. What is an instance of a problem?

An instance of a problem is the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

Example: Sorting problem instance

- Input: <31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58>
- Output: <26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59>

## 1.9. Why study data structures and algorithms?

- They are essential for writing efficient programs.
- They are fundamental to computer science.
- They are fun!

## 1.10. What is the goal of this course?

- Basic knowledge of mathematics (discrete math, calculus, probability).

## 1.12. What is the textbook for this course?

## 1.17. What is the course schedule?

- The course schedule is on the course website.

## 1.18. What is the course outline?

- Introduction
- Asymptotic notation

- Heaps
- Hash tables
- Binary search trees
- Red-black trees
- B-trees
- Graphs
- Minimum spanning trees
- Shortest paths
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithms

- NP-completeness

## 1.19. What is the first topic?

- Asymptotic notation

## 1.20. What is asymptotic notation?

- Asymptotic notation is used to describe the running time of an algorithm.
- It is used to compare the efficiency of algorithms.
- It is used to ignore constant factors and lower-order terms.

## 1.21. What are the common asymptotic notations?

- O-notation (big-oh)
- Ω-notation (big-omega)
- Θ-notation (big-theta)
- o-notation (little-oh)
- ω-notation (little-omega)

## 1.22. What is O-notation?

- O(g(n)) = { f(n) : there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 <= f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0 }

## 1.23. What is Ω-notation?

- Ω(g(n)) = { f(n) : there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 <= c*g(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0 }

## 1.24. What is Θ-notation?

- Θ(g(n)) = { f(n) : there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that 0 <= c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n) for all n >= n0 }

## 1.25. What is o-notation?

- o(g(n)) = { f(n) : for any positive constant c, there exists a constant n0 such that 0 <= f(n) < c*g(n) for all n >= n0 }

## 1.26. What is ω-notation?

- ω(g(n)) = { f(n) : for any positive constant c, there exists a constant n0 such that 0 <= c*g(n) < f(n) for all n >= n0 }

## 1.27. What is the relationship between these notations?

- f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(f(n)) iff f(n) = Θ(g(n))
- f(n) = O(g(n)) iff g(n) = Ω(f(n))
- f(n) = o(g(n)) iff g(n) = ω(f(n))

## 1.28. What is the running time of an algorithm?

- The running time of an algorithm is the number of primitive operations executed.
- It is a function of the input size.

## 1.29. What is the input size?

- The input size depends on the problem.
- For sorting, the input size is the number of elements to be sorted.
- For multiplying two matrices, the input size is the dimensions of the matrices.

## 1.30. What is the best-case running time?

- The best-case running time is the running time for the best-case input of size n.

## 1.31. What is the worst-case running time?

- The worst-case running time is the running time for the worst-case input of size n.

## 1.32. What is the average-case running time?

- The average-case running time is the running time for a random input of size n.

## 1.33. Why do we usually care about the worst-case running time?

- The worst-case running time is an upper bound on the running time.
- It is often easier to analyze.
- The average-case running time is often as bad as the worst-case running time.

## 1.34. What is the running time of insertion sort?

- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
- It works by building a sorted array one element at a time.
- The running time of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst case.

## 1.35. What is the running time of merge sort?

- Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- It works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves.
- The running time of merge sort is O(n log n) in the worst case.

## 1.36. Which is faster, insertion sort or merge sort?

- For large n, merge sort is faster than insertion sort.
- For small n, insertion sort may be faster.

## 1.37. What is the running time of binary search?

- Binary search is a search algorithm that works on sorted arrays.
- It works by comparing the target value to the middle element of the array.
- The running time of binary search is O(log n) in the worst case.

## 1.38. What is the running time of linear search?

- Linear search is a search algorithm that works on any array.
- It works by scanning the array from left to right.
- The running time of linear search is O(n) in the worst case.

## 1.39. Which is faster, binary search or linear search?

- For large n, binary search is faster than linear search.
- For small n, linear search may be faster.

## 1.40. What is the running time of the naive algorithm for multiplying two n-digit numbers?

## 1.41. What is the running time of the Karatsuba algorithm for multiplying two n-digit numbers?

## 1.62. What is the substitution method?

## 1.64. What is the master method?

- The master method provides a cookbook solution for recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).

## 1.65. What are the cases of the master method?

- Case 1: f(n) = O(n^{log_b a - ε}) for some ε > 0 ⇒ T(n) = Θ(n^{log_b a})
- Case 2: f(n) = Θ(n^{log_b a}) ⇒ T(n) = Θ(n^{log_b a} log n)
- Case 3: f(n) = Ω(n^{log_b a + ε}) for some ε > 0 and af(n/b) <= cf(n) for some c < 1 and all sufficiently large n ⇒ T(n) = Θ(f(n))

## 1.66. What is the solution to the recurrence for merge sort?

- T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)
- a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = Θ(n)
- log_b a = log_2 2 = 1
- f(n) = Θ(n) = Θ(n^1) = Θ(n^{log_b a})
- This is case 2 ⇒ T(n) = Θ(n log n)

## 1.67. What is the recurrence for binary search?

- T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)

## 1.68. What is the solution to the recurrence for binary search?

- T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)
- a = 1, b = 2, f(n) = Θ(1)
- log_b a = log_2 1 = 0
- f(n) = Θ(1) = Θ(n^0) = Θ(n^{log_b a})
- This is case 2 ⇒ T(n) = Θ(log n)

## 1.72. What is the solution to the recurrence for the Karatsuba algorithm?

- T(n) = 3T(n/2) + Θ(n)
- a = 3, b = 2, f(n) = Θ(n)
- log_b a = log_2 3 ≈ 1.585
- f(n) = Θ(n) = O(n^{1.585 - ε}) for some ε > 0? Actually, n = O(n^{1.585 - ε}) for ε = 0.085? But we need to be careful.
- Actually, we can use case 1: f(n) = O(n^{log_2 3 - ε}) for ε = 0.1? But n is not O(n^{1.485})? Actually, n = O(n^{1.485}) is false.
- Wait, let's check: n^{log_2 3} ≈ n^1.585. We want to see if f(n) = O(n^{1.585 - ε}) for some ε > 0. But n is not O(n^{1.485}) because n grows faster than n^{1.485}? Actually, no: n = O(n^{1.485}) is true because 1 < 1.485. So we can take ε = 0.1, then n^{1.585 - 0.1} = n^{1.485}, and n = O(n^{1.485}) is true.
- So case 1 applies: T(n) = Θ(n^{log_2 3}) ≈ Θ(n^1.585)

## 1.73. What is the recurrence for Strassen's algorithm?

- T(n) = 7T(n/2) + Θ(n^2)
- a = 7, b = 2, f(n) = Θ(n^2)
- log_b a = log_2 7 ≈ 2.807
- f(n) = Θ(n^2) = O(n^{2.807 - ε}) for some ε > 0? For example, ε = 0.5, then n^{2.807 - 0.5} = n^{2.307}, and n^2 = O(n^{2.307}) is true.
- So case 1 applies: T(n) = Θ(n^{log_2 7}) ≈ Θ(n^2.
