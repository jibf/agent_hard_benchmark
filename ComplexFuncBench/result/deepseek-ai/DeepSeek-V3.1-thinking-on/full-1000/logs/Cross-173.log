This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Draw detection when the board is full
- Restart option after a game ends
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pygame using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.

2. Run the game by executing the following command:
   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player X's turn.

2. Click on an empty cell to place your mark.

3. Players alternate turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

4. After the game ends, click anywhere on the screen to restart.

## Game Controls

- **Mouse**: Click on cells to place your mark
- **Mouse**: Click anywhere to restart after game ends

## Code Structure

- `main()`: Main game loop
- `draw_lines()`: Draws the game board grid
- `draw_figures()`: Draws X and O marks on the board
- `mark_square()`: Marks a square with the current player's mark
- `available_square()`: Checks if a square is empty
- `board_is_full()`: Checks if the board is completely filled
- `check_win()`: Checks if the current player has won
- `draw_vertical_winning_line()`: Draws a vertical line through winning squares
- `draw_horizontal_winning_line()`: Draws a horizontal line through winning squares
- `draw_diagonal_winning_line()`: Draws a diagonal line through winning squares
- `restart()`: Resets the game state

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following constants at the top of the code:

- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Window dimensions
- `LINE_WIDTH`: Width of grid lines
- `BOARD_ROWS`, `BOARD_COLS`: Number of rows and columns in the board
- `SQUARE_SIZE`: Size of each cell
- `CIRCLE_RADIUS`, `CIRCLE_WIDTH`: Properties of O marks
- `CROSS_WIDTH`, `SPACE`: Properties of X marks
- Colors: `BG_COLOR`, `LINE_COLOR`, `CIRCLE_COLOR`, `CROSS_COLOR`
