2025-08-13 23:29:26,293 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Milan for a four-day business trip on December 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Prague directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-13 23:32:55,092 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Final Response: I need a bit more information to help you find the best multi-stop flights:

1. **Where are you flying from to Milan?** (e.g., your departure city)
2. **Which nearby city do you plan to visit after Milan?** (e.g., Venice, Florence, Turin, etc.)

Once you provide these details, I'll search for multi-stop flights that fit your itinerary!
