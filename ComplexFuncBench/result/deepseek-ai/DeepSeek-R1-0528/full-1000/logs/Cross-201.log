2025-08-13 23:25:31,632 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Madrid for a seven-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Rome directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-13 23:27:35,641 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Final Response: To find multi-stop flights for your trip, I need a few more details:

1. **Your departure city (where you'll start from)**: You mentioned flying back to Rome, but I need to know where you're departing from initially.
2. **The nearby city you plan to visit after Madrid**: Could you specify which city you'd like to go to for your vacation? For example, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, etc.

Once you provide these details, I can look up the airports and find the best flight options for your itinerary!
