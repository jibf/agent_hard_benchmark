2025-08-14 22:24:21,630 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Orlando for a three-day business trip on October 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Toronto directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 22:24:28,717 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Final Response: To assist you with finding multi-stop flights, I'll need to gather some information first:

1. **Departure City/Airport**: Where will you be flying from to Orlando?
2. **Nearby City**: Which nearby city would you like to visit after your business trip in Orlando?
3. **Return Date**: When would you like to return to Toronto after your vacation?

Once I have this information, I can proceed with searching for the flights.
