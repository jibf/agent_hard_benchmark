2025-08-14 21:37:01,406 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-98 - INFO - Query: My friends and I are planning to go on vacation to New York in US in November 2024. We hope to find two accessible hotels that are suitable for wheelchair users throughout the month. Could you compare the policies of these two hotels?
2025-08-14 21:37:13,483 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-98 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find accessible hotels in New York for your November 2024 trip! To search for hotels and compare their policies, I need a few more details:

1. **Specific dates**: You mentioned "throughout the month" - could you provide specific check-in and check-out dates? For example, are you looking at the entire month (November 1-30, 2024) or specific dates within November?

2. **Number of guests**: How many adults will be staying, and do you need multiple rooms?

3. **Any children**: Will there be any guests under 18?

Once I have these details, I can:
- Search for hotels in New York
- Find options that would work for your group
- Retrieve the specific policies for wheelchair accessibility and other accommodations for comparison

Please provide the specific dates and guest information so I can help you find the best accessible hotel options!
