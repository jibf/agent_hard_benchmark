2025-08-14 20:51:54,192 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to San Francisco for a four-day business trip on November 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Seattle directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:02,540 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the right flights, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure date from Seattle to San Francisco**: You mentioned November 15, 2024 - is this correct?

2. **Travel date from San Francisco to the nearby city**: Since you're staying 4 days for business, would this be November 19, 2024?

3. **Which nearby city** would you like to visit for your 5-day vacation? (For example: Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, etc.)

4. **Return date from the vacation city to Seattle**: Based on 5 days of vacation, would this be around November 24, 2024?

5. **Number of passengers**: Just yourself (1 adult)?

6. **Cabin class preference**: Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First Class?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary!
