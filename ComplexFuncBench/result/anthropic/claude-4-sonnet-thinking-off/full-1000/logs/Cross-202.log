2025-08-14 20:51:50,353 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Los Angeles for a five-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Vancouver directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:51:59,354 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the best flights, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Vancouver - is Vancouver also where you'll be departing from initially?

2. **Nearby city destination**: Which nearby city are you planning to visit after Los Angeles for your vacation? (For example: San Diego, San Francisco, Las Vegas, etc.)

3. **Return date**: When do you plan to fly back to Vancouver from your vacation destination?

4. **Travel preferences**: 
   - How many passengers?
   - Any preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?
   - Any children traveling with you?

Once I have these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that will take you from your departure city → Los Angeles → nearby city → back to Vancouver with the right timing for your trip!
