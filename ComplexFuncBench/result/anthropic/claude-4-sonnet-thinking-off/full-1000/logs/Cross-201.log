2025-08-14 20:51:45,335 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Madrid for a seven-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Rome directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:51:57,641 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the best options, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Rome, but where are you departing from initially? Is Rome your starting point?

2. **Return date**: You mentioned:
   - 7 days in Madrid for business (starting Dec 5, 2024)
   - 4 days in a nearby city for vacation
   - Then flying back to Rome
   
   So your return date would be around December 16, 2024 (Dec 5 + 7 + 4 days)? Please confirm the exact return date.

3. **Nearby city**: Which city near Madrid would you like to visit for your vacation? Some popular options include:
   - Barcelona
   - Seville
   - Valencia
   - Lisbon, Portugal
   - Or another specific city you have in mind?

4. **Travel preferences** (optional):
   - Number of passengers?
   - Cabin class preference (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?
   - Any preference for flight sorting (Best, Cheapest, or Fastest)?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary!
