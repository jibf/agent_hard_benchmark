We hope to find three accessible hotels that are suitable for wheelchair users throughout the month. Could you compare the policies of these three hotels?
2025-08-14 21:37:18,753 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-99 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find accessible hotels in London for December 2024 and compare their policies. However, I need a few more details to search for hotels:

1. **Specific dates**: Could you provide the exact check-in and check-out dates in December 2024? (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **Number of guests**: How many adults will be staying? Are there any children under 18, and if so, what are their ages?

3. **Number of rooms**: How many rooms do you need?

Once you provide these details, I can:
1. Search for hotels in London
2. Filter for accessible/wheelchair-friendly options
3. Find three suitable hotels
4. Retrieve and compare their specific policies regarding accessibility and other important terms

Please share these details so I can help you find the best accessible accommodations for your group!
