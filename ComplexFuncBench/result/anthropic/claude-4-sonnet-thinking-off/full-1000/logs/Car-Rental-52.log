2025-08-14 20:24:51,603 - evaluation_logger_Car-Rental-52 - INFO - Query: I'm at the Mission District, San Francisco. My friends and I are planning to rent a car near the hotel for Thanksgiving in 2024. We'll set off at 8 AM and return the car at the same place at 8 AM the next day. Could you help me check the price of the rental package including extra protection insurance?
2025-08-14 20:25:07,169 - evaluation_logger_Car-Rental-52 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find car rental options in the Mission District, San Francisco for Thanksgiving 2024! However, I need a couple more details to search for the best options:

1. **Specific date**: Which day in Thanksgiving week 2024 would you like to pick up the car? Thanksgiving Day 2024 is November 28th - would you prefer that day or another day during that week?

2. **Exact pickup location**: You mentioned "near the hotel" - could you provide the specific hotel name or address? This will help me find the most convenient car rental locations.

Once you provide these details, I can:
- Find car rental locations near your hotel
- Search for available vehicles for your 24-hour rental period (8 AM pickup to 8 AM return the next day)
- Get pricing information including protection insurance packages

Please let me know the specific date and hotel location, and I'll get you the rental and insurance pricing information right away!
