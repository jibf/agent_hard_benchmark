2025-08-14 21:36:56,273 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-96 - INFO - Query: My friends and I are planning to go on vacation to Tokyo in December 2024. We hope to find three accessible hotels that are suitable for wheelchair users throughout the month. Could you compare the policies of these three hotels?
2025-08-14 21:37:05,400 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-96 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find accessible hotels in Tokyo for December 2024! To search for hotels and compare their policies, I need a few more details:

1. **Specific check-in and check-out dates** - You mentioned "throughout the month" but I need exact dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-12-01 to 2024-12-31)

2. **Number of adults** in your group

3. **Number of rooms** you'll need

4. **Any children** in your group and their ages

Once I have these details, I can:
1. Search for hotels in Tokyo
2. Filter for accessible/wheelchair-friendly options
3. Get the detailed policies for three suitable hotels to compare their accessibility features

Could you please provide these details so I can help you find the best accessible accommodations for your Tokyo vacation?
