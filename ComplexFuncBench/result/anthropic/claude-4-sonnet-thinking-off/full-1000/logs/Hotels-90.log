2025-08-14 21:36:35,426 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-90 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find accessible hotels in Paris for November 2024 and compare their policies. To search for hotels, I need a few more details:

1. **Specific dates**: What are your check-in and check-out dates in November 2024? (I need the exact dates in YYYY-MM-DD format)

2. **Number of guests**: How many adults will be staying, and do you need multiple rooms?

3. **Children**: Will there be any children under 18, and if so, what are their ages?

Once you provide these details, I can:
- Search for hotels in Paris
- Look for properties with accessibility features
- Get the detailed policies for two suitable hotels
- Compare their wheelchair accessibility and other relevant policies for you

Please share these details and I'll get started on finding the perfect accessible accommodations for your group!
