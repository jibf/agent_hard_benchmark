2025-08-14 20:52:11,219 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Vienna for a five-day business trip on November 30, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Hamburg directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:21,508 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! However, I need a few more details to search for the right flights:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Hamburg, but where are you departing from initially? Is it Hamburg as well, or another city?

2. **Nearby city destination**: You mentioned traveling to "a nearby city" after Vienna for vacation. Which specific city would you like to visit? 

3. **Return date**: When do you plan to fly back to Hamburg? You mentioned 5 days in Vienna + 5 days vacation, so would that be around December 10th, 2024?

4. **Travel preferences**: 
   - How many passengers?
   - Any preferred cabin class?
   - Any children traveling with you?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that would take you from your origin → Vienna (Nov 30) → nearby vacation city → Hamburg.
