2025-08-14 21:19:17,814 - evaluation_logger_Cross-389 - INFO - Query: I'm going to have a meeting at the Madison Square Garden in New York on November 18, 2024. After the meeting ends at 1 PM, I will fly from New York to Los Angeles for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Los Angeles after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 50 kilometers of the airport in Los Angeles and check what fun places there are around the hotel.
