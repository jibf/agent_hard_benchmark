2025-08-14 20:52:04,782 - evaluation_logger_Cross-207 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Ottawa for a five-day business trip on November 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Calgary directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:15,811 - evaluation_logger_Cross-207 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the best options, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Calgary, but where are you departing from initially? Is it Calgary as well?

2. **Nearby city for vacation**: Which city near Ottawa would you like to visit for your 3-day vacation? Some popular options near Ottawa include:
   - Toronto
   - Montreal  
   - Quebec City
   - Kingston

3. **Return date**: When would you like to fly back to Calgary? Based on your timeline:
   - November 20: Arrive in Ottawa
   - 5 days business (Nov 20-24)
   - 3 days vacation in nearby city (Nov 25-27)
   - So return flight around November 28?

4. **Flight preferences**: 
   - How many passengers?
   - Preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary!
