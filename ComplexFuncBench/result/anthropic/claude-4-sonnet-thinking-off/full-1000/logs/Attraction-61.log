## **Opera Concert Ticket in Rome with Dinner** - $86.62 USD ✅

This is a fantastic option that's under $100! Here's what's included:
- **Opera concert** in the historic Waldensian Church by Opera da Camera di Roma
- Performance by **incredible tenor and soprano soloists** accompanied by grand piano
- **VIP sector ticket** for the concert
- **Dinner** at Enoteca Corsi (a cozy, family Italian restaurant)
- Free cancellation available

The Opera da Camera di Roma has even been awarded the Travelers' Choice certificate for 2022 by TripAdvisor!

**Note:** The first option I checked was "Opera Serenades in Palazzo Doria Pamphilj" at $103.95, which was over your $100 budget, so I moved to the next one and found this great alternative.

There are also three other opera attractions available in Rome if you'd like me to check their prices:
- Italian Opera & Romantic Piano Concert in Rome
- Rooftop Bar Opera Show: The Great Beauty of Rome  
- Open-Air Opera Concert with Terrace Aperitif in the Heart of Rome

Would you like me to check the details and pricing for any of these other options as well?
