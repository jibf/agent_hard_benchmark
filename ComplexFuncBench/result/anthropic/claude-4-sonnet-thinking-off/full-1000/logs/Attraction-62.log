2025-08-14 21:57:39,925 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-62 - INFO - Final Response: Great news! I found some Harry Potter-themed attractions in London, and one of them is well under your budget of 100!

**Perfect Option Under Budget:**
**Harry Potter's London: A Self-Guided Audio Tour** - £7.57 per person

This is an excellent and affordable option for your Harry Potter fan! Here's what it includes:

- A self-guided walking tour through London's magical streets
- Licensed tour guide narration by Ian Grover
- Sites from multiple movies (The Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, Order of the Phoenix, and Deathly Hallows Part 1)
- Notable locations include:
  - Muggle Prime Minister's home on Downing Street
  - Where Harry, Ron, and Hermione broke into the Ministry of Magic
  - Great Scotland Yard (where Harry and Mr. Weasley enter the Ministry via red telephone box)
  - Piccadilly Circus locations from the films

**Features:**
- Lifetime access to the tour
- Works offline with GPS
- Available on both Android and iOS
- Explore at your own pace
- Wheelchair accessible
- Free cancellation

This is a fantastic deal at under £8 and gives you the flexibility to explore Harry Potter filming locations at your own pace with professional commentary. It covers multiple movie locations and provides a comprehensive Harry Potter experience in London.

For comparison, the first tour I checked (Harry Potter's London Experience Tour) was £395, so this self-guided option is much more budget-friendly while still offering a great Harry Potter experience!
