2025-08-14 20:51:36,429 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to London for a three-day business trip on November 18, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Berlin directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:51:47,836 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! However, I need a few more details to search for the right flights:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Berlin, but where are you departing from initially? (I assume Berlin, but want to confirm)

2. **Nearby city destination**: Which nearby city to London are you planning to visit for your vacation? Some popular options include:
   - Paris, France
   - Amsterdam, Netherlands
   - Brussels, Belgium
   - Edinburgh, Scotland
   - Dublin, Ireland

3. **Return date**: When do you want to fly back to Berlin after your 2-day vacation?

4. **Flight preferences** (optional):
   - Number of passengers?
   - Preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?
   - Any preference for sorting results (Best, Cheapest, or Fastest)?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that will take you from your departure city → London → nearby city → back to Berlin with the right timing for your trip!
