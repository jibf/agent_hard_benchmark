2025-08-14 20:51:53,322 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Orlando for a three-day business trip on October 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Toronto directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:03,489 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the best options, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Toronto, but where are you departing from initially? (I assume Toronto, but want to confirm)

2. **Nearby city for vacation**: You mentioned traveling to a nearby city after Orlando for fun - which city would you like to visit? If you're not sure, I could help you find cities near Orlando first.

3. **Specific dates**: 
   - Departure date: October 20, 2024 (confirmed)
   - Orlando to vacation city: October 23, 2024? (after 3 days of business)
   - Return to Toronto: October 27, 2024? (after 4 days of vacation)

4. **Travel preferences**:
   - Number of passengers (adults/children)?
   - Preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?

Once I have these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary perfectly!
