2025-08-14 20:52:11,080 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Miami for a two-day business trip on December 10, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Boston directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:22,154 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! To search for the best flights, I need a few more details:

1. **Departure city**: You mentioned flying back to Boston, so I assume you're departing from Boston initially - is that correct?

2. **Nearby city destination**: You mentioned traveling to a "nearby city" after Miami for vacation. Which specific city would you like to visit? (For example: Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Key West, etc.)

3. **Return date**: You mentioned:
   - December 10, 2024: Arrival in Miami
   - 2 days business in Miami 
   - 4 days vacation in the nearby city
   - Then fly back to Boston

   So would you be returning to Boston on December 16, 2024 (10th + 2 + 4 days)?

4. **Departure date from Boston**: When would you like to depart Boston to arrive in Miami on December 10th?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that will take you Boston → Miami → [nearby city] → Boston.
