2025-08-14 20:52:01,731 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Milan for a four-day business trip on December 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Prague directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 20:52:14,886 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip to Milan and vacation extension! However, I need a few more details to search for the best options:

1. **Departure date from Prague to Milan**: You mentioned arriving December 15, 2024 - is this your departure date or arrival date?

2. **Departure date from Milan to nearby city**: This would be after your 4-day business trip ends.

3. **Return date to Prague**: This would be after your 2-day vacation in the nearby city.

4. **Which nearby city**: Do you have a preference for which city near Milan you'd like to visit? (e.g., Venice, Florence, Rome, Zurich, Nice, etc.)

5. **Number of passengers**: How many adults and any children?

6. **Cabin class preference**: Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First class?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that will take you Prague → Milan → [nearby city] → Prague with the right timing for your business and leisure travel!
