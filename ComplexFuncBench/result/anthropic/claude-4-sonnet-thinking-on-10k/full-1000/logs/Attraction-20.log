2025-08-16 03:11:06,175 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: Awesome! The Stone Forest you saw on social media is likely the famous **Stone Forest (Shilin) near Kunming, China** - and it's absolutely incredible! Here's the detailed information:

## About the Stone Forest

The Stone Forest is a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** featuring spectacular limestone formations that create an otherworldly landscape. This specific tour focuses on the **Naigu Stone Forest (乃古石林)**, which is:

- **AAAAA-class scenic area** (highest tourism rating in China)
- **Much less touristy** than the main Major and Minor Stone Forest areas
- Features unique limestone formations you can walk through on stone-paved trails
- Offers opportunities to trek to peaks for **bird's-eye views** of the entire site

## What Makes It Special

🏔️ **Geological Wonder**: Ancient limestone formations creating natural stone "pillars" and "forests"
🌿 **Cultural Experience**: Visit to Suogeyi Sani village, part of the UNESCO heritage site
🥾 **Adventure**: Stone-paved trails winding through unique rock formations
📸 **Instagram-worthy**: Absolutely stunning photo opportunities that explain why it's viral on social media

## Tour Details
- **Location**: Near Kunming, Yunnan Province, China
- **Price**: Around $105 USD for a private day tour
- **Includes**: English-speaking guide, hotel pickup/drop-off, air-conditioned vehicle, driver, and lunch at a local Yi restaurant
- **Additional Costs**: Entrance fees (~$9), fuel surcharge (~$15-23), and tolls (~$10)

## Important Note
⚠️ I should mention that this particular tour operator has had some service issues based on recent reviews, so if you're planning to visit, I'd recommend researching alternative tour companies or visiting independently.

The Stone Forest itself is absolutely worth visiting - it's one of China's most spectacular natural wonders and totally deserves its social media fame! Have you been thinking about planning a trip there?
