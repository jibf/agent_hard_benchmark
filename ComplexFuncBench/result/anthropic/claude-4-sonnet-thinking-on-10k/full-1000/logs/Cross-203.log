2025-08-16 02:16:16,801 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Orlando for a three-day business trip on October 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Toronto directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?

2025-08-16 02:16:39,946 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Final Response: Great! I found the airport information for Toronto and Orlando. Now I need a couple more details to search for your multi-stop flights:

1. **Which nearby city** would you like to visit for your 4-day vacation after Orlando? (For example: Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, etc.)

2. Let me confirm the dates based on your itinerary:
   - **October 20, 2024**: Toronto → Orlando (for 3-day business trip)
   - **October 23, 2024**: Orlando → [nearby city] (for 4-day vacation) 
   - **October 27, 2024**: [nearby city] → Toronto (return home)

Are these dates correct?

Once you let me know the nearby city you'd like to visit, I can search for multi-stop flights that fit your complete itinerary!
