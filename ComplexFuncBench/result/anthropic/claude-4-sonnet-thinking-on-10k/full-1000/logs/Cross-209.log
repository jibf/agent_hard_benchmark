2025-08-16 02:16:31,719 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Vienna for a five-day business trip on November 30, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Hamburg directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-16 02:16:44,505 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you search for multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! 

Based on your itinerary, I understand you want:
1. Hamburg → Vienna (November 30, 2024)
2. Vienna → nearby city (December 5, 2024, after 5 days of business)
3. Nearby city → Hamburg (December 10, 2024, after 5 days of vacation)

However, I need to know which nearby city you'd like to visit for your vacation portion. Could you please specify which city near Vienna you're planning to visit? This will allow me to search for the appropriate multi-stop flights for your trip.

Once you provide the destination city, I'll be able to search for flights that match your travel dates and route.
