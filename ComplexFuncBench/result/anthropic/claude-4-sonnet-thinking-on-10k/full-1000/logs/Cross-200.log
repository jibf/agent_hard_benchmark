2025-08-16 02:15:50,265 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to London for a three-day business trip on November 18, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Berlin directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-16 02:16:06,871 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! However, I need a few more details to search for the right flights:

1. **Departure city**: I assume you're starting from Berlin based on your mention of flying back there - is that correct?

2. **Nearby city destination**: Which city near London would you like to visit for your 2-day vacation? Some popular options might be Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, etc.

3. **Specific dates**: You mentioned November 18, 2024 for the first leg, but I need the exact dates for all three flights:
   - Berlin → London: November 18, 2024
   - London → [nearby city]: November ? (after 3 days of business)
   - [nearby city] → Berlin: November ? (after 2 days of vacation)

4. **Preferences**: Any preference for cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) or how you'd like the results sorted (Best, Cheapest, Fastest)?

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that fit your itinerary perfectly!
