2025-08-16 02:16:08,415 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Los Angeles for a five-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Vancouver directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-16 02:16:23,708 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you search for multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! However, I need a few more details to search for the right flights:

1. **Which nearby city** would you like to visit after Los Angeles? (For example: San Diego, Las Vegas, San Francisco, etc.)

2. **Specific dates** for each leg:
   - Vancouver to Los Angeles: December 5, 2024 âœ“
   - Los Angeles to [nearby city]: What date? (December 10th after your 5-day business trip?)
   - [Nearby city] to Vancouver: What date? (December 12th after your 2-day vacation?)

3. **Number of passengers** and any **cabin class preference**?

Once you provide the nearby city and confirm the dates, I can search for the airport locations and find multi-stop flight options that fit your itinerary perfectly!
