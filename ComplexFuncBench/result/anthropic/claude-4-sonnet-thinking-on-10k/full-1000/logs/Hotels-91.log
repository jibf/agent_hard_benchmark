2025-08-16 02:59:54,443 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-91 - INFO - Query: My friends and I are planning to go on vacation to Berlin in May 2025. We hope to find three accessible hotels that are suitable for wheelchair users throughout the month. Could you compare the policies of these three hotels?
2025-08-16 03:00:08,966 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-91 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find accessible hotels in Berlin and compare their policies! However, I need a few more details to search for hotels effectively:

1. **Specific dates**: Could you provide the exact check-in and check-out dates in May 2025? The search requires specific dates.

2. **Number of guests**: How many adults will be staying, and do you need multiple rooms?

3. **Any children**: Will there be any children under 18 in your group?

Once I have these details, I can:
- Search for hotels in Berlin for your dates
- Identify options that would be suitable for wheelchair users
- Retrieve and compare the policies of three hotels for you

Please provide the specific dates and guest information, and I'll get started on finding those accessible hotels for your Berlin vacation!
