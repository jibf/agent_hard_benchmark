2025-08-16 02:16:20,388 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to San Francisco for a four-day business trip on November 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Seattle directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-16 02:16:35,653 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation! However, I need a few clarifications to search for the right flights:

1. **Departure city**: I assume you're departing from Seattle (since you mentioned flying back there), but could you confirm this?

2. **Nearby city for vacation**: Which specific nearby city to San Francisco would you like to visit for your 5-day vacation? Some popular options include Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, or Portland.

3. **Specific dates**: Based on your timeline:
   - Seattle → San Francisco: November 15, 2024
   - San Francisco → [Nearby city]: November 19, 2024 (after 4 days)
   - [Nearby city] → Seattle: November 24, 2024 (after 5 days)
   
   Are these dates correct?

Once you provide the specific nearby city and confirm these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary perfectly!
