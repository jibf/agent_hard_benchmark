2025-08-16 03:00:21,972 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-99 - INFO - Query: My friends and I are planning to go on vacation to London in December 2024. We hope to find three accessible hotels that are suitable for wheelchair users throughout the month. Could you compare the policies of these three hotels?
2025-08-16 03:00:36,837 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-99 - INFO - Final Response: I'd be happy to help you find wheelchair-accessible hotels in London and compare their policies! To search for the best options, I need a few more details:

1. **Specific dates**: You mentioned December 2024, but I need exact check-in and check-out dates (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. **Number of guests**: How many adults will be staying?
3. **Number of rooms**: How many rooms do you need?
4. **Children**: Will there be any children under 18? If so, what are their ages?

Once I have these details, I can:
1. Search for London hotels with accessibility filters
2. Find hotels that are wheelchair accessible
3. Retrieve and compare the policies of 3 suitable hotels for you

Could you please provide these details so I can help you find the perfect accessible accommodations?
