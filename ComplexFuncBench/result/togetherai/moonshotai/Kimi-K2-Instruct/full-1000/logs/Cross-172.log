**Distance from hotel:** Only 0.78 km away - perfect for a morning walk!

**Rating:** 9.1/10 from 76 reviews

This is the closest major attraction to your hotel and one of Hokkaido's most important Shinto shrines. It's particularly beautiful during cherry blossom season and offers a peaceful escape from the city.

- **Showa Shinzan** - An active volcano where you can visit a bear farm with 100 purebred Hokkaido brown bears (you can even feed them!)
- **Lake Toyako Observatory** - Panoramic views of the volcanic landscape
- **Otaru** - Charming port town featuring the famous Kitaichi Glass workshop and Otaru Music Box Museum

### **Tour Details:**

- **Price:** Around $92 USD
- **Includes:** Air-conditioned transportation, pickup/drop-off, driver-guide, and service fees
- **Languages:** Available in English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese
