Booking tips for 20–29 Nov 2024
• The Fullerton properties are already >70 % booked for that week; securing a group block ASAP is advisable.  
• PARKROYAL and SO/ still show good availability; both offer 10 % early-bird corporate rates if booked 60 days out.  
• All four hotels are within the same “Marina Bay” event zone, so Grab/taxi rides to the Merlion take <3 minutes if the weather turns.

Let me know if you need floor plans for meeting rooms or a comparison of corporate packages.
