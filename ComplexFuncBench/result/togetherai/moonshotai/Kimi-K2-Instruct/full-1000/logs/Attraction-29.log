2025-08-14 02:33:01,874 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-29 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s the scoop on the Times Square experience that’s trending:

**Times Square Photoshoot**  
A professional, high-quality photo session right in the heart of Times Square, New York City. Instead of relying on selfies, you’ll get expertly framed shots from a local photographer who knows the best angles and hidden spots.

**What’s included**  
- High-resolution digital photos delivered in a private, secure gallery  
- Guidance from a local expert who doubles as your photographer and mini-tour guide  
- Wheelchair-accessible route and transport options nearby  
- Service animals welcome; infants can ride in strollers  

**Logistics & policies**  
- **Price:** From US $107.49 per group (not per person)  
- **Duration:** Roughly 30–45 minutes of shooting time (exact timing confirmed after booking)  
- **Meeting point:** Near the TKTS red steps in Times Square (exact details sent after booking)  
- **Cancellation:** Free cancellation up to 24 hours before the start time  
- **Age requirement:** Bookers must be 18+; anyone can be in the photos  

**Pro tip**  
Evening slots just after sunset give you that iconic neon glow in the background, but early-morning sessions are almost empty if you want the streets to yourselves.
