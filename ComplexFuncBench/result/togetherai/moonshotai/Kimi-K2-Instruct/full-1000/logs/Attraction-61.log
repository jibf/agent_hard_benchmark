**"Opera Concert Ticket in Rome with Dinner"** - **$86.62 USD**

This experience includes:
- A fantastic opera concert at the historic Waldensian Church featuring incredible tenor and soprano soloists accompanied by grand piano
- The concert is presented by Opera da Camera di Roma, which has been awarded the Travelers' Choice certificate for 2022 by Trip Advisor
- A lovely dinner at Enoteca Corsi, a cozy family Italian restaurant after the concert
- VIP sector seating for the concert

The experience is suitable for all fitness levels and has free cancellation available. Since your child is a huge fan of the Opera series, this would be a perfect cultural experience combining beautiful music in a historic setting with authentic Italian dining.

Would you like me to check any of the other Opera attractions as well, or does this one sound perfect for your needs?
