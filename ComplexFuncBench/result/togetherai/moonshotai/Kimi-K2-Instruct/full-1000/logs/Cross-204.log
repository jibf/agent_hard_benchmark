2025-08-14 00:59:57,355 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to San Francisco for a four-day business trip on November 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Seattle directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 01:02:57,655 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Final Response: I'll help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation. Let me break this down into the flight legs you need:

1. From your departure city to San Francisco on November 15, 2024
2. From San Francisco to a nearby vacation city (after your 4-day business trip)
3. From the vacation city back to Seattle

However, I need a bit more information to search for the perfect flights:

1. **Where are you flying from initially?** (your departure city)
2. **Which nearby city would you like to visit for your 5 days of fun?** (Popular options near San Francisco include Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Portland, etc.)
3. **What cabin class would you prefer?** (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)
4. **How many adults will be traveling?**

Once you provide these details, I can search for the multi-stop flights that match your itinerary!
