2025-08-14 00:59:57,357 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Miami for a two-day business trip on December 10, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Boston directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 01:04:25,732 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Final Response: I'll help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation. Let me break this down into the three legs of your journey:

1. **Leg 1**: From Boston to Miami on December 10, 2024 (for business)
2. **Leg 2**: From Miami to a nearby city (for vacation - I need to know which city)
3. **Leg 3**: From that nearby city back to Boston

To search for these flights, I need to know which nearby city you'd like to visit for your 4 days of fun after your business meetings in Miami. Some popular nearby destinations from Miami include:

- **Orlando** (theme parks, entertainment)
- **Fort Lauderdale** (beaches, nightlife)
- **Key West** (tropical paradise)
- **Tampa** (Gulf Coast beaches)
- **Naples** (upscale Gulf Coast)

Which nearby city would you like to visit for your vacation portion? Once you let me know, I can search for all three flight legs together.
