2025-08-14 01:05:40,610 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Final Response: Great! I have the airport codes for both Hamburg (HAM.AIRPORT) and Vienna (VIE.AIRPORT). Now I need to determine which nearby city you'd like to visit for your 5 days of fun after your business trip in Vienna. 

Since you mentioned a "nearby city" for vacation, let me suggest some popular options close to Vienna that would work well for your itinerary:

**Popular nearby cities for leisure after Vienna:**
- **Prague, Czech Republic** (~4 hours drive/train from Vienna)
- **Budapest, Hungary** (~2.5 hours drive/train from Vienna) 
- **Salzburg, Austria** (~2.5 hours drive/train from Vienna)
- **Bratislava, Slovakia** (~1 hour drive/train from Vienna)

Could you let me know which city you'd prefer for your vacation portion? Once you decide, I can search for the multi-stop flights with this routing:

1. **Hamburg → Vienna** (November 30, 2024)
2. **[Vienna nearby city] → Hamburg** (December 10, 2024 - 5 days Vienna + 5 days vacation)

Which nearby city would you like to explore for your fun days?
