2025-08-14 00:59:57,071 - evaluation_logger_Cross-205 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Chicago for a two-day business trip on December 1, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to New York directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 01:04:16,076 - evaluation_logger_Cross-205 - INFO - Final Response: I'll help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip. Let me break this down into the legs you need:

1. From your departure city to Chicago on December 1, 2024
2. From Chicago to a nearby city for your 3-day vacation
3. From that nearby city back to New York

However, I need a few details to search for the perfect flights:

1. **Where are you flying from initially?** (your departure city for the first flight to Chicago)
2. **Which nearby city would you like to visit for your 3-day vacation?** (Chicago has great options like Milwaukee, Indianapolis, St. Louis, etc.)
3. **What date would you fly from the nearby city back to New York?** (This would be 3 days after you arrive there from Chicago)

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary perfectly!
