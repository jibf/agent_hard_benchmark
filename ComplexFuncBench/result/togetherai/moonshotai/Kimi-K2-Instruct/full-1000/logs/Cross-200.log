After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Berlin directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?

2025-08-14 01:05:07,398 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Final Response: I have the flight location IDs for London (LON.CITY) and Berlin (BER.AIRPORT). However, to search for multi-stop flights, I need to know which nearby city you'd like to visit for your two days of fun after your business meetings in London. 

Could you please specify which city you'd like to travel to for your vacation portion? For example, are you thinking of cities like:
- Paris
- Amsterdam  
- Edinburgh
- Dublin
- Or another specific city?

Once you let me know the destination city, I can search for multi-stop flights with the following routing:
1. **November 18, 2024**: From Berlin to London (for your 3-day business trip)
2. **November 21, 2024**: From London to your chosen vacation city (for 2 days of fun)
3. **November 23, 2024**: From your vacation city back to Berlin
