2025-08-14 00:59:57,678 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Los Angeles for a five-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Vancouver directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 01:04:17,958 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Final Response: I'll help you find multi-stop flights for your business trip and vacation. Let me break this down into the flight legs you need:

1. From your departure city to Los Angeles on December 5, 2024
2. From Los Angeles to a nearby city for your vacation (after your 5-day business trip, so around December 10, 2024)
3. From that nearby city back to Vancouver

However, I need a bit more information to search for the perfect flights:

1. **Where are you flying from to Los Angeles?** (Your departure city)
2. **Which nearby city would you like to visit for your 2-day vacation?** (Popular options near LA include San Diego, Las Vegas, San Francisco, etc.)
3. **How many adults will be traveling?** (I'll assume 1 unless you specify otherwise)

Once you provide these details, I can search for multi-stop flights that match your itinerary perfectly!
