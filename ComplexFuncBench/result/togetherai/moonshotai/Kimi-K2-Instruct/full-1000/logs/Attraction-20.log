2025-08-14 02:32:16,560 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: Here‚Äôs the lowdown on the **Stone Forest Day Tour** that‚Äôs been trending on your feed:

### üåÑ **What It Is**
The tour focuses on **Naigu Stone Forest** (‰πÉÂè§Áü≥Êûó), a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** and **AAAAA-class scenic area** in **Kunming, China**. Unlike the more crowded Major/Minor Stone Forest zones, Naigu offers a quieter, more immersive experience. You‚Äôll trek limestone trails, explore unique karst formations, and climb to a panoramic viewpoint. The tour also includes **Suogeyi Sani Village**, a UNESCO-listed ethnic settlement where you‚Äôll experience local **Yi culture** and enjoy an authentic lunch.

### üöó **What‚Äôs Included**
- **Private guide** (English-speaking)  
- **Hotel pickup/drop-off** in Kunming  
- **Air-conditioned vehicle** + driver  
- **Lunch** at a local Yi restaurant  
- **Fuel/tolls** (paid separately to driver: ~100‚Äì150 RMB for 5‚Äì7-seat car)  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads-Up**
- **Entrance fee**: 60 RMB (Naigu Stone Forest)  
- **Group size**: 2‚Äì9 people max  
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair-friendly, suitable for all fitness levels  
- **Cancellation**: Free up to 24 hours  

### üö® **Reality Check**
A recent review flagged that the operator (**51 Adventures**) **no-showed** and was unreachable. While this might be an isolated case, it‚Äôs worth double-checking availability and reviews before booking.

### üìç **Location**
Kunming, Yunnan Province, China (about 1.5 hours from the city center).
