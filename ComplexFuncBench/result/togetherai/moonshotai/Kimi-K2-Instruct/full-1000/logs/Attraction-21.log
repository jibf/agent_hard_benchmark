2025-08-14 02:32:11,786 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-21 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s the scoop on the Arc de Triomphe experience that’s currently bookable:

**What you get**  
- A private, 2-hour guided tour of the Arc de Triomphe with an expert guide.  
- Skip-the-line entrance ticket that takes you all the way up to the rooftop terrace (284 steps or an elevator if you need it).  
- Panoramic views over Paris—perfect for spotting the Eiffel Tower, the sweeping Champs-Élysées, and more.

**Logistics & fine print**  
- **Operator:** AKOPSO  
- **Price:** Around US $410 for the private tour (covers your group, not per person).  
- **Cancellation:** Free cancellation is available.  
- **Meeting point:** You’ll receive exact details after booking, but it’s right at the monument.  
- **Accessibility:** Not wheelchair-friendly overall; elevator to the top is only for those who truly need it.  
- **Age:** 18+ to book solo, otherwise an adult must accompany.

**What’s not included**  
Transport, food/drinks, tips—so plan accordingly.

If you’re looking for the classic “climb to the top for the sunset” moment, this private option gives you a guide to unpack all the history and symbolism while you soak in the 360° views.
