2025-08-14 02:32:32,340 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s the scoop on Westminster Abbey, straight from the tour that gets you inside:

What it is  
Westminster Abbey is a 700-year-old Gothic “royal peculiar” (that means it belongs directly to the monarch, not a bishop). Every English coronation—from William the Conqueror in 1066 to Queen Elizabeth II—has happened right here under its soaring vaults. It’s also the church where Prince William married Kate Middleton in 2011, and where seventeen other royal weddings have taken place.

Who’s buried there  
Walking the floor is like stepping on a giant history book. You’ll find:
- Monarchs: Elizabeth I and her half-sister Mary I (frenemies in life, neighbors in death)  
- Scientists: Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking  
- Writers: Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling  
- The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, commemorating fallen WWI troops

Tour highlights  
- The Coronation Chair – the 700-year-old oak throne used in every crowning ceremony  
- Henry VII’s Lady Chapel – fan-vaulted stone work so intricate it looks like lace turned to rock  
- The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Galleries – newly opened 13th-century triforium 52 ft above the nave, reached by a narrow hidden staircase; you’ll stand among flying buttresses and gargoyles while artifacts and interactive displays tell the abbey’s secrets  
- Modern Martyrs’ portraits – huge stained-glass figures celebrating 20th-century Christians killed for their faith

Practical stuff  
- Duration: private guided tour with an English-speaking local expert  
- Includes: pre-booked entry tickets, so you skip the public queue  
- Accessibility: wheelchair-friendly, service animals welcome, public transit nearby  
- Price: from about US $565 for the private tour (covers guide and entry; food, tips, hotel transfers extra)  
- Cancellation: free cancellation up to 24 hours in advance

If you just want to visit on your own, you can still buy a standard entry ticket at the door, but the private tour gets you into the upper galleries and gives you a storyteller who can decode every stone.
