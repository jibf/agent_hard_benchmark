2025-08-14 02:32:58,286 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-28 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s the scoop on the Tokyo Tower experience that’s been blowing up your feed:

**What it actually is**  
You’re looking at “Red Tokyo Tower Night Ticket,” a next-gen digital theme-park that lives inside the iconic Tokyo Tower. Think three whole floors packed with high-tech games and VR attractions—Japan’s largest playground of its kind.

**What you can do there**  
- Crush nearly 20 interactive attractions: AR bouldering, AR dodgeball, and even a real-life “Red Light, Green Light” course inspired by the viral Korean drama.  
- Brand-new 360° VR ride that just dropped in January 2024—expect screams.  
- Full-scale e-motor simulators if you want to feel like an F1 driver.  
- Retro digital games for a hit of nostalgia.  
- Bonus: a “robot fight” arena that opened April 24 (extra fee, but who doesn’t want to watch bots battle?).

**Practical stuff**  
- **Price:** Around $25 USD.  
- **What’s included:** Admission, unlimited rides on everything, Wi-Fi, restrooms on-site, all taxes.  
- **Accessibility:** Wheelchair-friendly, strollers welcome, service animals allowed.  
- **Health notes:** Moderate fitness level recommended; not ideal if you’re pregnant, have spinal issues, or serious heart problems.  
- **Cancellation:** Free cancellation up to the last minute.

So if you’re in Tokyo and want to level-up from just snapping pics of the tower, this is where you go to actually play inside it.
