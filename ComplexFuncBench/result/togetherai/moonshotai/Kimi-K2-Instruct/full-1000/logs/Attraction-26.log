2025-08-14 02:33:00,264 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-26 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s the low-down on the Forbidden City so you can plan like a pro:

What it is  
• UNESCO-listed palace complex in the heart of Beijing – 980 buildings, 600+ years of imperial history.  
• Ticket product I found is simply called “Forbidden City Ticket” (USD ≈ $9.90) and is run by Authentic China Tours.

What the ticket actually covers  
✅ Entrance ticket to the Forbidden City itself.  
❌ No tour guide, no transport, no add-on museums (Clock, Jewelry, Meridian Gate, etc.).  
❌ Not valid for Chinese ID holders – overseas passports only.

How it works  
1. Pre-book online (you’ll need to supply full name, passport front-page image, and a WhatsApp number).  
2. Show your passport at the gate – no physical ticket pick-up, so you skip the long cash queues.  
3. Choose morning or afternoon entry slot when you book.

Practical stuff  
• Free cancellation up to 24 h before.  
• Public transport nearby (subway lines 1 & 8 – Tiananmen East/West stops).  
• Not wheelchair accessible; lots of walking and stairs, so you need a decent level of fitness.  
• They can cancel last-minute for “unforeseen reasons,” so keep an eye on messages.  
• You must be 18+ to book or travel with an adult.

Recent traveler vibe  
42 reviews averaging 4.9/5 – people love the palace itself but mention the site can get crowded and the audio-guide route is a bit tricky to follow.

Bottom line  
Grab the ticket online, bring your passport, wear comfy shoes, and budget at least half a day to wander the vast courtyards and halls.
