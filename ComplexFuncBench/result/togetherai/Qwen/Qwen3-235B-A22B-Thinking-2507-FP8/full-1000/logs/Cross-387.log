2025-08-13 21:03:02,221 - evaluation_logger_Cross-387 - INFO - Query: I'm going to have a meeting at the FTX Arena in Miami on November 30, 2024. After the meeting ends at 5 PM, I will fly from Miami to Orlando for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Orlando after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 30 kilometers of the airport in Orlando and check what fun places there are around the hotel.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they have a meeting at FTX Arena in Miami on November 30, 2024, ending at 5 PM. They need the earliest flight to Orlando after that, a taxi to the airport, a hotel near Orlando airport within 30 km, and nearby attractions.

Starting with the flight. To find flights, I need departure and arrival airport IDs. The user is flying from Miami to Orlando. So first, I should use Search_Flight_Location for both cities to get the correct airport IDs. Let me check the tools available. The Search_Flight_Location function takes a query, so I'll call it for "Miami" and "Orlando" to get their respective airport IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned FTX Arena in Miami. Maybe the departure airport is Miami International (MIA), but I should confirm by searching. Similarly, Orlando's main airport is MCO. But the function will return the correct IDs based on the query.

Next, after getting the airport IDs, use Search_Flights with fromId (Miami's ID), toId (Orlando's ID), departDate as 2024-11-30. Since the meeting ends at 5 PM, the flight should be after that. The user wants the earliest flight after 5 PM, so maybe sort by FASTEST or CHEAPEST? Wait, the sort parameter can be BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST. But the user wants the earliest departure time after 5 PM, so maybe sort by departure time. However, the function's sort options don't include time directly. Maybe using BEST would prioritize earliest flights. Alternatively, the API might handle it, but the parameters require sort. Let's set sort to FASTEST to get the quickest flight, which might also be the earliest.

Wait, the user says "earliest flight to Orlando after the meeting", so departure time after 5 PM. The Search_Flights function requires departDate, which is 2024-11-30. The returnDate isn't needed since it's a one-way trip. So parameters: fromId, toId, departDate, sort=FASTEST (to get the earliest possible).

But first, need the airport IDs. So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for Miami and Orlando.

Then, once flight is found, need to book a taxi from FTX Arena to Miami airport. So need to get the googlePlaceId for FTX Arena and Miami airport. Wait, the taxi search requires pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. The pick-up is FTX Arena, drop-off is Miami airport.

So use Taxi_Search_Location for "FTX Arena, Miami" to get its googlePlaceId, and another for "Miami International Airport" to get the airport's googlePlaceId.

Then, Search_Taxi with those place IDs, pick-up time right after 5 PM, say 5:30 PM, and date 2024-11-30.

Next, for the hotel in Orlando near the airport (within 30 km). First, need the coordinates of Orlando airport. Use Search_Flight_Location for Orlando to get the airport's details, which might include coordinates? Wait, the Search_Flight_Location function's description says it returns airports by location, but the parameters for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates require latitude and longitude. Alternatively, maybe use Search_Hotel_Destination for Orlando to get coordinates, but the user wants near the airport. So better to get the airport's coordinates.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location response might have the airport's coordinates. Let me check the tool description: "Find airports by their location...". The endpoint is /api/v1/flights/searchDestination. Maybe the response includes latitude and longitude. If so, after getting Orlando airport's ID via Search_Flight_Location, perhaps the coordinates are available. But the tool parameters don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe use another tool like Location to Lat Long, but that's not listed here. Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires latitude and longitude, which can be retrieved from api/v1/meta/locationToLatLong, but that function isn't in the provided tools. Wait, looking back, the Search_Hotel_Destination function says: "This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So if I call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Orlando", it might return the city's coordinates, but the user wants near the airport. Hmm.

Alternatively, after getting the Orlando airport's ID via Search_Flight_Location, maybe the airport's coordinates are part of the response. Let's assume that when we search for "Orlando" using Search_Flight_Location, the result includes the main airport (MCO) with its coordinates. Then, use those coordinates for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 30 km.

Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates parameters require latitude and longitude. So steps:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get airport ID and possibly coordinates.
But the tool description for Search_Flight_Location doesn't mention returning coordinates. The Search_Hotel_Destination does return latitude and longitude. So maybe use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Orlando" to get the city's coordinates, but the user wants near the airport. Alternatively, the airport's location might be a specific query.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Use Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get the airport's ID (e.g., MCO).
- Then, perhaps there's another way to get the coordinates, but given the tools available, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination with "Orlando" gives coordinates of the city, but the airport is a bit outside. Alternatively, search for "Orlando International Airport" in Search_Hotel_Destination to get precise coordinates.

Wait, the user wants hotels within 30 km of the airport, so the coordinates of the airport are needed. Let's try:

Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Orlando International Airport" to get its latitude and longitude.

Then use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 30.

Once the hotel is found, get its ID and call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By to find nearby attractions.

So the steps are:

1. Find Miami airport ID using Search_Flight_Location("Miami")
2. Find Orlando airport ID using Search_Flight_Location("Orlando")
3. Search flights from Miami to Orlando on 2024-11-30, sort by FASTEST or CHEAPEST to get earliest after 5 PM
4. Find FTX Arena's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location("FTX Arena, Miami")
5. Find Miami airport's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location("Miami International Airport")
6. Search taxi from FTX Arena to Miami airport on 2024-11-30 at 5:30 PM
7. Find Orlando airport coordinates via Search_Hotel_Destination("Orlando International Airport")
8. Search hotels near those coordinates with radius 30 km
9. For the hotel found, get popular attractions nearby

But need to check which tools are available. Let's list the required function calls in order.

First, for flights:

- Call Search_Flight_Location for "Miami" to get fromId
- Call Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get toId
- Then Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-30, sort=FASTEST (to get earliest flight after 5 PM)

Wait, but the user wants the earliest flight after 5 PM. The Search_Flights function may return flights departing after 5 PM if the API handles it, but the parameters don't specify a time filter. So maybe the sort=FASTEST would prioritize the earliest departure time. Alternatively, the API might require additional parameters, but according to the tool description, the required parameters are toId, fromId, departDate. So we have to rely on the sort parameter. BEST might be a combination, but FASTEST would be the quickest flight, which might depart earliest.

Next, taxi:

- Taxi_Search_Location for "FTX Arena, Miami" to get pick_up_place_id
- Taxi_Search_Location for "Miami International Airport" to get drop_off_place_id
- Then Search_Taxi with those IDs, pick_up_date=2024-11-30, pick_up_time=17:30 (5:30 PM)

For hotel:

- Need coordinates of Orlando airport. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Orlando International Airport" to get latitude and longitude
- Then Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-11-30 (assuming they arrive same day), departure_date=next day or as per vacation, but user didn't specify. Wait, the user says "after the meeting ends at 5 PM, I will fly... for a vacation." So flight is on Nov 30, arrive in Orlando same day. Hotel check-in would be same day. So arrival_date=2024-11-30, departure_date=maybe next day, but user didn't specify duration. However, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires arrival_date and departure_date. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps assume one night, so departure_date=2024-12-01. But the user might not have specified, but the function requires it. So need to set those dates.

But the user's main point is to find a hotel near the airport upon arrival. So arrival_date is 2024-11-30, departure
