Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want their friend to fly from Chongqing to Boston with a layover in Singapore around December 15, 2024. The main goals are to find the cheapest multi-stop flight dates and get the seat map, avoiding overnight layovers.

First, I need to figure out the correct airports. Chongqing's airport code is CKG, but the user mentioned using location IDs from the Search_Flight_Location API. So I should call Search_Flight_Location with "Chongqing" to get the correct fromId. Similarly for Singapore and Boston.

Wait, the user said layover in Singapore, so the legs would be Chongqing -> Singapore -> Boston. So two legs: first leg from Chongqing to Singapore, second from Singapore to Boston. The date for the first leg is around December 15, but the API for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops looks 5 days before and after, so maybe the exact date isn't critical yet.

But first, I need the location IDs. Let me check the tools available. The Search_Flight_Location function takes a query. So I should call that for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston to get their respective IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned "Chongqing" and "Boston", but the API might need specific names. Let me make sure. For example, Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, Boston Logan International Airport.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the correct IDs.

Once I have the IDs, I can use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs: [Chongqing to Singapore on Dec 15, Singapore to Boston on Dec 15 + layover time]. But the user said no overnight layovers, so the layover must be same day. So the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's arrival date, but since it's a multi-stop, the dates for each leg need to be specified. Wait, the legs array requires each leg's date. So first leg date is Dec 15, second leg date would be Dec 15 plus the layover duration, but since it's same day, maybe same date? Wait, no. If the first flight arrives in Singapore on Dec 15, the second flight would depart Singapore on Dec 15 as well, same day. So both legs have date Dec 15? Or the second leg's date is the next day if the layover is overnight. But the user doesn't accept overnight, so both legs should be on the same day.

Wait, but the API for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops requires each leg's date. So for a multi-stop flight with a layover in Singapore, the first leg is Chongqing to Singapore on date X, the second leg is Singapore to Boston on date X (same day). So the dates for both legs are the same. But the user says "around December 15", so maybe the first leg is around Dec 15, and the second leg is the same day.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. So if we set the date as Dec 15 for both legs, the API will check from Dec 10 to Dec 20 for the first leg, and same for the second leg? Wait, no. The legs array has each leg's date. So for the first leg, date is Dec 15, and the API will look 5 days around that. But the second leg's date would need to be after the first leg's arrival. However, since it's a multi-stop flight, the dates are sequential. But the user says no overnight layovers, so the second leg must depart on the same day as the first leg arrives.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the first step is to get the location IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston.

Let me structure the tool calls:

1. Search_Flight_Location with query "Chongqing" to get fromId for first leg.
2. Search_Flight_Location with query "Singapore" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.
3. Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston" to get toId for second leg.

Once we have those IDs, we can construct the legs array for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

Assuming the dates for both legs are December 15, 2024. But since the user says "around" that date, the API will check 5 days before and after. However, the legs' dates are specified as December 15, so the API will look for flights departing Chongqing on dates from Dec 10 to Dec 20, and Singapore to Boston on dates from Dec 10 to Dec 20. But we need to ensure that the second leg's date is the same as the first leg's arrival date, which is same day. So maybe the second leg's date is the same as the first leg's date. But if the first flight arrives in Singapore on Dec 15, the second flight must depart Singapore on Dec 15. So both legs have date Dec 15.

But the user says "around December 15", so maybe the first leg's date is Dec 15, and the API will check 5 days around that, but the second leg's date would need to be adjusted based on the layover. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function probably handles the connection, so we just need to specify the dates for each leg as the intended departure dates. Since it's a multi-stop, the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's date plus the layover time, but since no overnight, same day.

So legs would be:

[
  { "fromId": "CKG.AIRPORT", "toId": "SIN.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-15" },
  { "fromId": "SIN.AIRPORT", "toId": "BOS.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-15" }
]

But need to confirm the correct IDs from the Search_Flight_Location.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with those IDs and dates.

Once we get the cheapest flight, we need the offerToken to call Get_Seat_Map.

But the user also says "get the seat map for the flight", so after finding the cheapest flight, we need to retrieve its offerToken, probably via Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, but the Get_Min_Price might not return the offerToken. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops description says it returns the lowest priced flights, but does it include offerToken? The tool description isn't clear. The Get_Seat_Map requires offerToken from Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

So perhaps the process is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, Boston.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates.
3. Then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs, cabin class, etc., to get the actual flights, including offerToken.
4. Then use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight, so maybe Get_Min_Price gives the dates, then Search_Flights to get the specific flight's offerToken.

But the user's main request is to "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map".

So first, get the min price to find the dates, then get the seat map for that flight.

But to get the seat map, we need the offerToken, which requires searching for the flights.

So steps:

- Get location IDs.
- Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest date(s).
- Then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same parameters to get the flight details, including offerToken.
- Then call Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user mentioned "he doesn't accept flights with overnight layovers", so during the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, we might need to filter, but the API parameters don't mention layover duration. So perhaps the Get_Min_Price and Search_Flights will return options, and we have to check the layover time, but the tool calls can't filter that. So maybe the initial Get_Min_Price will return the cheapest, but we have to assume that the API handles the layover constraint. However, the user's note is a constraint, so perhaps the assistant needs to ensure that when getting the flights, the layover is not overnight. But since the tools don't have a parameter for that, maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops returns multiple options, and the assistant would have to pick one with same-day layover. But as per the problem statement, the assistant should call the tools as needed.

Given that, the first step is to get the location IDs.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location for "Chongqing".
Second: Search_Flight_Location for "Singapore".
Third: Search_Flight_Location for "Boston".

Then, use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

Assuming the dates are both 2024-12-15.

Then, once we have the min price response, which should include the dates, but the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the lowest price within 5 days before
