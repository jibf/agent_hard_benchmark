Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the user reviews for the Element Edmonton West hotel from November 10 to 15, 2024.

First, I need to figure out which function to use. The available tools include Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-, which requires a hotel_id. But the user provided the hotel name, not the ID. So I need to get the hotel_id first.

Looking at the tools, there's Search_Hotel_Destination which can find hotels by location, but the user already specified the hotel name. Wait, maybe Search_Hotels is the right one here. The Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. But the user is asking for reviews, so maybe first I need to find the hotel ID using Search_Hotels.

Wait, the Search_Hotels function's description says it's for searching hotels, and it requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. But the user mentioned the specific hotel name: Element Edmonton West. So perhaps I should first use Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Element Edmonton West" to get the location details, but that might not directly give the hotel ID. Alternatively, maybe Search_Hotels can be used with the destination ID for Edmonton, but the user specified the exact hotel name.

Wait, the Search_Hotels function parameters include search_type, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. Hmm. Maybe the process is: first, use Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Element Edmonton West" to get the destination ID or hotel ID. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response contains latitude and longitude, but maybe the hotel ID is part of that? Or perhaps the Search_Hotels function can take the hotel name as part of the search.

Wait, looking at the Search_Hotels parameters: it requires dest_id, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. So maybe first, I need to search for the destination "Edmonton" to get the dest_id, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and the hotel name to find the specific hotel's ID.

But the user is asking specifically for Element Edmonton West. Let me check the parameters for Search_Hotels. The parameters include search_type, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. Wait, maybe the search_type is a type of location, but the hotel name might be part of the search.

Alternatively, perhaps the Search_Hotels function can be used with the destination ID for Edmonton, and then filter by hotel name. But the parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a hotel name field. The required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date.

Wait, maybe the dest_id is the key here. So first, I need to get the dest_id for Edmonton. Let's use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Edmonton" to get the dest_id. Then, use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-15, and maybe other parameters to find the specific hotel.

But the user is asking for reviews, so once we have the hotel_id from Search_Hotels, we can call Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- with that hotel_id.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" to get possible locations. Wait, but the function's description says it's for finding hotels by location, address, etc., and returns latitude and longitude. Maybe it's better to search for "Edmonton" first to get the dest_id.

Wait, the user mentioned "Element Edmonton West", which is a specific hotel. So perhaps using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" would return the specific hotel's details, including its ID.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says: "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So maybe if I search for "Element Edmonton West", it will return the hotel's location data, but does it include the hotel_id? The parameters for Search_Hotels require dest_id, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. But perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination response includes a hotel ID.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function is the one that returns the hotel_id. Let me check the parameters for Search_Hotels. It requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first, get dest_id by searching for Edmonton, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id to find the specific hotel.

Wait, but the user is asking for a specific hotel name. So perhaps the process is:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" to get the destination ID or hotel ID.

But the Search_Hotel_Destination's response might not directly give the hotel_id. Maybe it's better to use Search_Hotels with the destination ID for Edmonton and filter by hotel name.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function can take the hotel name as part of the search_type or other parameters. Wait, the parameters for Search_Hotels include search_type, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, looking at the Search_Hotels parameters: "search_type can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination endpoint". So perhaps first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" to get the search_type value, then use that in Search_Hotels.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function returns data that includes a 'type' which might be used as search_type in Search_Hotels. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, which is a numerical ID obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination. For example, if I search for "Edmonton" in Search_Hotel_Destination, it returns a dest_id like 12345, then use that in Search_Hotels.

But the user is asking for a specific hotel, so perhaps after getting the dest_id for Edmonton, use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and the dates to list hotels in Edmonton, then find the Element Edmonton West in the results to get its hotel_id.

So steps:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Edmonton" to get dest_id.
2. Use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-15 to get a list of hotels in Edmonton.
3. From the list, find Element Edmonton West and extract its hotel_id.
4. Then call Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- with that hotel_id.

But the user hasn't provided the dest_id, so the assistant needs to first get that. However, the user's query is about reviews, so the immediate need is to get the hotel_id for Element Edmonton West.

Wait, but the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function requires hotel_id, which the user doesn't have. So the assistant must first find the hotel_id.

Given that, the first step is to use Search_Hotels to find the hotel_id for Element Edmonton West. But to use Search_Hotels, we need dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination.

So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" to get the dest_id. Wait, but Search_Hotel_Destination is for location, not specific hotels. Maybe querying "Element Edmonton West" in Search_Hotel_Destination will return the specific hotel's details, including its ID.

Alternatively, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination returns a list of locations, and one of them is the hotel. Let's assume that.

So first tool call: Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West".

Then, from the response, get the dest_id or hotel_id. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response isn't specified here, but the parameters for Search_Hotels require dest_id from this endpoint.

Assuming that Search_Hotel_Destination returns a dest_id that can be used in Search_Hotels.

Wait, the Search_Hotels parameters say: "dest_id can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination endpoint".

So, first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" to get the dest_id.

Wait, but "Element Edmonton West" is a hotel name, not a location. Maybe the correct approach is to search for Edmonton as the location, get the dest_id for Edmonton, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and the hotel name.

But the Search_Hotels function doesn't have a parameter for hotel name. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function returns a list of hotels in the destination, and the hotel name is part of the response. So:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Edmonton" to get dest_id for Edmonton.
2. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date to get list of hotels in Edmonton.
3. Find Element Edmonton West in the list and get its hotel_id.
4. Call Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- with that hotel_id.

But the user specified the exact hotel name, so perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Element Edmonton West" would directly give the necessary dest_id or hotel_id.

Wait, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the hotel_id, so the assistant needs to find it. The available tools require hotel_id for reviews, so the assistant must first retrieve it.

Given the tools, the correct sequence is:

- Use Search_Hotel_Destination to get location
