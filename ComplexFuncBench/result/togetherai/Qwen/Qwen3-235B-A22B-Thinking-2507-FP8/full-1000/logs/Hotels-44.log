Okay, let's see. The user asked for two hotels within fifty kilometers of McCormick Place for their research group of five, needing three rooms from December 20th to 25th, 2024. They also wanted descriptions of each hotel.

First, I used Search_Hotel_Destination with "McCormick Place, Chicago" to get the coordinates. The response gave latitude and longitude, which I then used in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the dates, radius 50 km, 3 rooms, and 5 adults. That returned two hotels: SureStay Plus Hotel (28785) and Hyatt Place (882392).

Next, I called Get_Description_And_Info for both hotel IDs. The descriptions came back. Now I need to present the info clearly.

Check the details: Both hotels are in Lombard, which is near Chicago. The user's group has five people, so three rooms make sense (maybe two rooms with two people and one with one, but the user specified three rooms). The dates are correct. The radius is 50 km, which both hotels are within.

For SureStay Plus: It's 1 km from Yorktown Shopping Center, free WiFi, breakfast, 24-hour fitness, business center. Close to airports. The description mentions rooms with amenities, some have fridges and microwaves. The policy info includes a $50 deposit.

Hyatt Place has an indoor pool, dining options, free parking, and is near Yorktown too. Rooms have sofa beds, fridge, coffee maker. Also close to O'Hare.

I should structure the response with each hotel's name, key features, price, and description. Highlight proximity to McCormick Place (though the exact distance isn't given, but they're within 50 km), amenities relevant to a research group (WiFi, business center, breakfast), and any policies like deposits.

Make sure to mention the total price for the stay. The first hotel's total is $1301.25, the second $1804.50. Note that prices include taxes or not? The composite_price_breakdown shows excluded taxes, but the all_inclusive_amount is the total. Wait, the first hotel's all_inclusive_amount is $1444.39, but min_total_price is $1301.25. Wait, maybe the min_total_price is before taxes? The user might need to know the total cost.

Wait, looking at the tool response for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates, the first hotel's min_total_price is 1301.25, but the composite_price_breakdown's all_inclusive_amount is 1444.3875. So the total including taxes is around $1444. Similarly, the second hotel's min_total_price is 1804.5, all_inclusive is 2002.995. So the actual total would be higher. But the user might just need the base price or the total. The problem says "provide descriptions", but maybe include the price range.

Wait, the user didn't ask for prices, but since they're looking for hotels, including the price is helpful. The original query says "assist in finding two hotels... and provide descriptions". So descriptions should include key amenities, location relative to McCormick, and maybe price.

But the user's main need is location within 50 km, three rooms, dates, and descriptions. The response should list both hotels with their descriptions, mention they're within the radius, and key points for a research group (like business facilities, breakfast, WiFi).

Check if the hotels are actually within 50 km of McCormick Place. The coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination were latitude 41.850952, longitude -87.6168. The hotels' coordinates: SureStay is at 41.846373, -88.009323. Let me calculate the distance roughly. The longitude difference is about 0.3925 degrees, which at Chicago's latitude is roughly 0.3925 * 85 km ≈ 33.36 km. So about 33 km from McCormick, which is within 50. Hyatt is at 41.84346, -87.99545, similar longitude difference, so also around 33 km. So both are within 50 km.

So the answer should present both hotels with their names, key features from the descriptions, proximity, and maybe note the price range. Since the user is a research group, emphasize business amenities, breakfast, and convenience.
