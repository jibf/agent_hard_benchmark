Okay, let's see. The user wants to find a hotel near Etihad Stadium for November 10, 2024, and then book a taxi from that hotel to Old Trafford Stadium at 10 AM the next day.

First, I need to figure out the location of Etihad Stadium. So I should use the Search_Hotel_Destination function with the query "Etihad Stadium". That will give me the latitude and longitude, but more importantly, the dest_id needed for searching hotels.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says it returns latitude and longitude, but the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id. So maybe the dest_id comes from that endpoint. Let me check the parameters for Search_Hotels: dest_id is required and can be retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first step is to call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Etihad Stadium".

Once I have the dest_id, I can then call Search_Hotels with arrival_date as 2024-11-10, departure_date as 2024-11-11 (since the taxi is the next day), and the dest_id. But the user didn't specify departure date, but since they need the taxi the next day, departure from the hotel would be on the 11th. Wait, arrival is 10th, departure is 11th. So arrival_date is 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-11.

Then, after getting the hotel, need to book a taxi from the hotel to Old Trafford. So first, need the hotel's location (googlePlaceId) for pick-up. But the hotel search might not give the exact place ID. Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location function can be used to find the googlePlaceId for the hotel. Wait, but the user is staying at a hotel near Etihad, so maybe the hotel's address can be used to get its googlePlaceId.

Alternatively, once the hotel is found via Search_Hotels, perhaps the response includes the address, which can then be used in Taxi_Search_Location to get the pick-up place ID. But the user hasn't specified a particular hotel yet, so first need to find a hotel near Etihad.

So step 1: Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Etihad Stadium" to get dest_id.

Step 2: Use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-11.

Once hotels are found, pick one, then get its address. Then use Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel's address to get pick_up_place_id.

Then, need to get drop_off_place_id for Old Trafford Stadium. So call Taxi_Search_Location with "Old Trafford Stadium" to get its googlePlaceId.

Then, use Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id (from hotel), drop_off_place_id (Old Trafford), pick_up_date 2024-11-11, pick_up_time 10:00.

But the user hasn't specified which hotel, so maybe the assistant needs to first get the hotel destination, then search hotels, then for the taxi, get both locations.

So the first tool calls should be:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Etihad Stadium" to get dest_id.

2. Then Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival 2024-11-10, departure 2024-11-11.

But the user also needs the taxi, so after getting the hotel, need to find the hotel's location via Taxi_Search_Location (using the hotel's address from Search_Hotels response), and also Taxi_Search_Location for Old Trafford.

Wait, but the initial step is to find the hotel near Etihad, so first two tool calls are for the hotel search. Then, once the hotel is selected, get its place ID and Old Trafford's place ID for the taxi.

But since the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet, maybe the assistant should first get the dest_id for Etihad, then search hotels, then for the taxi part, get place IDs for both locations.

So the first tool call is Search_Hotel_Destination with "Etihad Stadium".

Then, once we have the dest_id, call Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-11.

After that, for the taxi, need to get pick-up place ID (the hotel's location) and drop-off place ID (Old Trafford). So call Taxi_Search_Location for "Old Trafford Stadium" to get its googlePlaceId.

But the hotel's exact address isn't known yet, so perhaps after getting the list of hotels from Search_Hotels, the user would pick one, and then we can use its address in Taxi_Search_Location. However, since the user hasn't specified which hotel, maybe the assistant should first get the place ID for Old Trafford, and then once the hotel is found, get its place ID.

But the problem is that the assistant needs to make the tool calls step by step. So the first step is to find the destination ID for Etihad Stadium via Search_Hotel_Destination.

Then, use that to search for hotels.

Then, for the taxi, need to find the place IDs for both the hotel (once selected) and Old Trafford.

But since the user's query is to assist with advance planning, the assistant should first get the necessary location IDs.

So the first tool call should be Search_Hotel_Destination with "Etihad Stadium".

Second tool call: Search_Hotel_Destination with "Old Trafford Stadium" to get its place ID for the taxi drop-off.

Wait, but Taxi_Search_Location is the function to get googlePlaceId for taxi locations. So for both the hotel (as pick-up) and Old Trafford (drop-off), we need to use Taxi_Search_Location.

But the hotel's address isn't known until we search for hotels near Etihad. So first, get the dest_id for Etihad via Search_Hotel_Destination, then search hotels, then from the hotel's address, get its googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.

But the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet, so maybe the assistant should first get the dest_id for Etihad, then search hotels, and then for the taxi part, get Old Trafford's place ID.

Wait, the user's request is to find a hotel near Etihad, then book a taxi from the hotel to Old Trafford. So the steps are:

1. Find hotels near Etihad Stadium (needs dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination for Etihad).

2. Once hotels are found, select one, then get its exact location (googlePlaceId) via Taxi_Search_Location.

3. Get Old Trafford's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.

4. Then call Search_Taxi with those place IDs, date 2024-11-11, time 10:00.

But since the user hasn't specified which hotel, the assistant can't proceed to step 2 without first getting the hotel list. So the initial tool calls should be:

- Search_Hotel_Destination for "Etihad Stadium" to get dest_id.

- Then Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival 2024-11-10, departure 2024-11-11.

- Then, for the taxi, need to get Old Trafford's place ID via Taxi_Search_Location "Old Trafford Stadium".

But the hotel's place ID isn't known yet, so maybe after getting the hotel list, the user would choose one, and then we can get its place ID. However, in the current step, the assistant needs to make the first tool calls.

So the first two tool calls would be:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination with "Etihad Stadium"

2. Taxi_Search_Location with "Old Trafford Stadium" (to get drop-off place ID)

Wait, but the taxi is from the hotel to Old Trafford, so drop-off is Old Trafford, pick-up is the hotel. So we need both place IDs. But the hotel's place ID depends on which hotel is chosen. So perhaps first get the dest_id for Etihad, search hotels, then for each hotel, get its place ID. But since the user hasn't selected a hotel yet, maybe the assistant should first get the dest_id for Etihad and the place ID for Old Trafford.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination is for hotels, while Taxi_Search_Location is for taxi locations. So Etihad Stadium's location for hotels might be different from taxi's googlePlaceId. Hmm, but probably the dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination is needed for the hotel search, and the googlePlaceId from Taxi_Search_Location is needed for the taxi.

So first, to search hotels near Etihad Stadium, use Search_Hotel_Destination with "Etihad Stadium" to get the dest_id.

Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

For the taxi, need to get the googlePlaceId for Old Trafford Stadium via Taxi_Search_Location.

But the pick-up location is the hotel, which we don't have yet. So after getting the hotel list, we can take one hotel's address and use Taxi_Search_Location to get its googlePlaceId.

But since the user hasn't specified which hotel, the assistant can't proceed further without first getting the hotel list.

Therefore, the first tool call should be Search_Hotel_Destination for "Etihad Stadium".

Second tool call: Taxi_Search_Location for "Old Trafford Stadium" to get its drop-off place ID.

Wait, but the user might not have the hotel selected yet, so maybe the assistant
