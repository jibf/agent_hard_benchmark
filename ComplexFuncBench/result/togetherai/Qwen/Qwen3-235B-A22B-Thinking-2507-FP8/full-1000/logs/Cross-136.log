I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in San Francisco and Los Angeles for two days each. Please provide hotels within 20 kilometers of the related airports in San Francisco and Los Angeles based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to check the fastest plane tickets for two separate trips: Toronto to San Francisco on Dec 10, 2024, and San Francisco to Los Angeles on Dec 12, 2024. They also need hotels near the airports in SF and LA within 20 km for their stays.

First, I need to find the airport IDs for Toronto, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The user mentioned "arrival airports of the flights," so for the first trip, the arrival airport is San Francisco, and for the second, it's Los Angeles. But to search flights, I need the departure and arrival location IDs.

So step 1: Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs. Let's start with Toronto. The query would be "Toronto". Then do the same for San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Wait, the user specified "arrival airports of the flights," so for the first flight, Toronto is departure (fromId), San Francisco is arrival (toId). For the second flight, San Francisco is departure (fromId), Los Angeles is arrival (toId).

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get its ID. Then for San Francisco, then Los Angeles.

Once I have the IDs, I can call Search_Flights for each route with sort=FASTEST.

But the user wants the fastest tickets, so sort parameter should be FASTEST.

For the first flight: fromId (Toronto's ID), toId (SF's ID), departDate 2024-12-10, sort=FASTEST.

Second flight: fromId (SF's ID), toId (LA's ID), departDate 2024-12-12, sort=FASTEST.

After getting the flight details, they need hotel info. For each arrival city (SF and LA), get the airport coordinates to search hotels within 20 km.

Wait, the hotels need to be within 20 km of the related airports. So for San Francisco, the arrival airport is SFO (assuming), so get SFO's coordinates. Similarly for Los Angeles (LAX).

But how to get the coordinates? The Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires latitude and longitude. To get those, maybe use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name? Or maybe the Search_Flight_Location returns coordinates?

Wait, looking at the tools: Search_Flight_Location's description says it returns airports by location, etc., and the ID can be used in Search_Flights. But does it return coordinates? The parameters for Search_Flight_Location don't mention coordinates, but maybe the response includes them. However, the user's tools don't specify the response structure, only the parameters.

Alternatively, for the hotels, the user says "based on the arrival airports of the flights." So once we have the flight details, maybe the arrival airport's coordinates are available. But the Get_Flight_Details function might provide that info. Wait, Get_Flight_Details is for flight details like baggage, price, etc., not sure about coordinates.

Alternatively, use Location_to_Lat_Long for the airport names. For example, query "San Francisco International Airport" to get its latitude and longitude.

So steps:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get fromId for first flight.
2. Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco to get toId for first flight and fromId for second flight.
3. Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles to get toId for second flight.

Then:

4. Search_Flights for Toronto to SF on Dec 10, sort=FASTEST.
5. Search_Flights for SF to LA on Dec 12, sort=FASTEST.

Then, for each arrival city (SF and LA), get the airport's coordinates:

6. Use Location_to_Lat_Long for "San Francisco International Airport" to get lat/long.
7. Similarly for "Los Angeles International Airport".

Then:

8. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for SF with arrival_date Dec 10, departure_date Dec 12 (since staying two days), radius 20 km.
Wait, the user says "stay in San Francisco and Los Angeles for two days each." So arrival in SF on Dec 10, stay two days, so departure on Dec 12. Then arrival in LA on Dec 12, stay two days, departure on Dec 14.

Wait, the flights are Toronto to SF on Dec 10 (arrive same day?), then SF to LA on Dec 12. So in SF from Dec 10 to Dec 12 (two days), then in LA from Dec 12 to Dec 14.

So for SF hotels: arrival_date 2024-12-10, departure_date 2024-12-12.

For LA hotels: arrival_date 2024-12-12, departure_date 2024-12-14.

But the user says "based on the arrival airports of the flights." So for SF, the arrival airport is SFO, so hotels near SFO. Similarly, LA's arrival airport is LAX.

So need coordinates for SFO and LAX.

But how to get those coordinates? The Location_to_Lat_Long function can take the airport name as query.

So first, call Location_to_Lat_Long for "San Francisco International Airport" and "Los Angeles International Airport".

Wait, but maybe the Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco returns the airport's coordinates? The tool description for Search_Flight_Location says it's for finding airports by location, etc., but the parameters only require a query, and the response isn't specified. However, the required parameters for other functions like Search_Flights need the ID from Search_Flight_Location.

Assuming that Search_Flight_Location returns the airport ID and possibly coordinates, but since the tool's response isn't detailed, maybe we need to use Location_to_Lat_Long for the airport names.

Alternatively, maybe the airport's location ID from Search_Flight_Location can be used in another endpoint to get coordinates, but the available tools don't have that. The only way to get coordinates is via Location_to_Lat_Long.

So steps:

- For each airport (Toronto, SF, LA), use Search_Flight_Location to get their IDs for flight searches.

- Then, for the hotel searches, use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names (e.g., "San Francisco International Airport") to get lat/long.

Wait, but the user said "hotels within 20 kilometers of the related airports". So the airports are the arrival points, which are SFO and LAX.

So first, get the coordinates of SFO and LAX using Location_to_Lat_Long.

But to do that, the query should be the airport name. So:

Call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "San Francisco International Airport" to get its coordinates.

Similarly for "Los Angeles International Airport".

Once we have those coordinates, we can call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius=20, arrival and departure dates as per the stay.

So the plan is:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto (to get fromId for first flight)
2. Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco (to get toId for first flight, fromId for second)
3. Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles (to get toId for second flight)
4. Search_Flights for Toronto->SF on 2024-12-10, sort=FASTEST
5. Search_Flights for SF->LA on 2024-12-12, sort=FASTEST
6. Location_to_Lat_Long for "San Francisco International Airport"
7. Location_to_Lat_Long for "Los Angeles International Airport"
8. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for SF coordinates, arrival 2024-12-10, departure 2024-12-12, radius=20
9. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for LA coordinates, arrival 2024-12-12, departure 2024-12-14, radius=20

But the user might not have specified the exact airport names, so maybe the Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco returns the main airport (SFO), and similarly for LA (LAX). So when using Location_to_Lat_Long, we can use the city name plus "International Airport" to get the coordinates.

Wait, but maybe the Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco returns the airport code or name, which can be used as the query for Location_to_Lat_Long.

Alternatively, perhaps the airport's location ID from Search_Flight_Location can be used in another way, but the tools don't specify that. So safest to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name.

So first, need to get the airport names from Search_Flight_Location. But since the tool responses aren't detailed, perhaps the assistant has to assume that Search_Flight_Location for "San Francisco" returns the main airport, which is SFO, and then use "San Francisco International Airport" as the query for Location_to_Lat_Long.

Therefore, the steps are as above.

Now, the user wants to book the tickets separately, so two separate flight searches.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Let's start with Toronto:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto".

Then San Francisco:

Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco".

Then Los Angeles:

Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles".

Once we have the IDs, call Search_Flights for each route.

Then, for hotels, get coordinates of SFO and
