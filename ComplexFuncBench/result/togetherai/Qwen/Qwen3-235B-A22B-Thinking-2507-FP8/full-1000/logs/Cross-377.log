Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want two main things: sightseeing routes near the Sheraton Ottawa Hotel for the day after tomorrow, and a taxi reservation from the hotel to the airport three and a half hours after the tour starts.

First, I need to figure out the date for "the day after tomorrow." Today is November 21, 2024. So tomorrow is the 22nd, and the day after is the 23rd. So the sightseeing is for November 23rd.

To get the attractions near the hotel, I need the hotel_id. The user mentioned Sheraton Ottawa Hotel. But the function Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires a hotel_id, which isn't provided. So I need to find the hotel_id first. How? The tools include Search_Hotel_Destination, which can search by location name. Wait, but Search_Hotel_Destination is for finding hotels by location, but maybe there's another way. Wait, looking at the tools, there's also Search_Hotels (mentioned in the description of Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By as being in the Hotels collection). However, the available tools don't list Search_Hotels as a function here. Wait, the user provided tools list includes functions like Search_Hotel_Destination, but not Search_Hotels. Wait, the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By's description says hotel_id can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchHotels or searchHotelsByCoordinates. But in the provided tools, those endpoints aren't listed as functions. Wait, the tools given are:

- Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By
- Search_Taxi
- Search_Flights
- Taxi_Search_Location
- Search_Hotel_Destination
- Get_Availability
- Search_Attraction_Location

So, to get the hotel_id for Sheraton Ottawa Hotel, maybe I need to use Search_Hotel_Destination? Wait, Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it's for finding hotels by location, address, etc., and returns latitude and longitude. But the user needs the hotel_id. Hmm. Wait, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination isn't the right tool here. Wait, the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id from SearchHotels or SearchHotelsByCoordinates, but those endpoints aren't in the provided tools. Wait, the user's tools list doesn't include SearchHotels as a function. Wait, looking back at the tools provided:

The first function's description says: "hotel_id can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchHotels**(Search Hotels)** or api/v1/hotels/searchHotelsByCoordinates**(Search Hotels By Coordinates)** endpoint in **Hotels** collection."

But in the tools list provided, those endpoints (Search Hotels and Search Hotels By Coordinates) are not listed as callable functions. The available tools under Hotels collection are Search_Hotel_Destination. Wait, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination is the one that can help find the hotel_id? Let me check the description of Search_Hotel_Destination: "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query."

Wait, but the user needs the hotel_id. If Search_Hotel_Destination returns latitude and longitude, maybe then we can use another function? Wait, but the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id. So perhaps there's a missing step here. Maybe the user expects that we first search for the hotel using Search_Hotel_Destination, but that might not give the hotel_id. Alternatively, maybe the Sheraton Ottawa Hotel's hotel_id is known or can be found via another method.

Wait, perhaps the user expects that we use Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" to get the location details, but the hotel_id might not be directly available. Hmm, this is a problem. Because without the hotel_id, we can't call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By.

Wait, maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination function actually returns hotel IDs? Let me check the description again: "This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." It doesn't mention hotel_id. So perhaps this is a gap. But the user's instruction says that the hotel_id can be retrieved from SearchHotels or SearchHotelsByCoordinates, which are not in the provided tools. So maybe in this scenario, we have to assume that the hotel_id is known or can be obtained through another means. But since the tools don't include those endpoints, perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed by first getting the hotel_id via Search_Hotel_Destination, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the Sheraton Ottawa Hotel's hotel_id is a standard value, but that's not realistic. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the user expects that we use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the coordinates, then use another function. Wait, but the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id, not coordinates.

This is a bit of a snag. Maybe the correct approach is to first call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" as the query to get the location details, but since the function's description says it returns latitude and longitude, perhaps that's not helpful for getting the hotel_id. Wait, but maybe the hotel_id is part of the response? The description isn't clear. The problem is that the tools provided don't include the SearchHotels function, which is mentioned in the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By's description as the way to get hotel_id.

Given that, perhaps the assistant is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the hotel_id can be obtained, but since it's not in the tools, maybe the user expects that we first call Search_Hotel_Destination to get the necessary info. Wait, but the Search_Hotel_Destination's purpose is to find hotels by location, but the user is asking for a specific hotel (Sheraton Ottawa). So perhaps querying "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" via Search_Hotel_Destination would return the hotel's details, including its ID.

Assuming that, the first step is to call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" to get the hotel_id. Wait, but the function's description says it returns latitude and longitude. Maybe the response includes the hotel_id? The problem is the tool's description isn't explicit. But given the constraints, perhaps that's the only way.

So step 1: Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" to get the hotel's details, possibly including hotel_id.

Once we have the hotel_id, we can call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with that hotel_id to get the attractions.

Then, for the taxi reservation: the user wants a taxi to pick up from the hotel three and a half hours after the tour starts, to the airport.

First, we need the pick-up place_id (hotel's googlePlaceId) and drop-off place_id (airport's googlePlaceId).

To get the hotel's googlePlaceId, perhaps after getting the hotel_id, but maybe we need to use Taxi_Search_Location. Wait, Taxi_Search_Location is for finding googlePlaceId for taxi locations.

So for the hotel, we can use Taxi_Search_Location with query "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" to get its googlePlaceId.

Similarly, for the airport, "Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport", use Taxi_Search_Location to get its googlePlaceId.

Then, the pick-up time is three and a half hours after the tour starts. But the tour start time isn't specified. Wait, the user says "three and a half hours after the tour starts". But the tour start time isn't given. Hmm. Wait, the user is asking to reserve a taxi that picks up three and a half hours after the tour starts. But without knowing when the tour starts, we can't determine the exact pick-up time. However, perhaps the tour start time is related to the attractions' availability. Wait, the user is checking sightseeing routes for the day after tomorrow (Nov 23), so maybe the tour starts at a typical time, like 9 AM? But the user hasn't specified. This is a problem.

Wait, the user says "Check the sightseeing routes for attractions near the Sheraton Ottawa Hotel for the day after tomorrow." So they want to know the available attractions on Nov 23. Then, reserve a taxi to pick up three and a half hours after the tour starts. But the tour start time isn't given. Maybe the assistant needs to assume a start time, but the problem is that the taxi reservation requires a specific pick-up time (HH:MM). Since the user hasn't specified when the tour starts, perhaps the assistant should proceed by first getting the attraction availability, which might include start times, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the "tour starts" refers to the time when the user begins visiting the attractions, which could be variable. But without specific info, the assistant might need to make an assumption or ask for clarification. However, since the task is to use the tools, perhaps the assistant should proceed by first getting the attractions, then determine a start time.

But given the instructions, the assistant must use the tools to fulfill the request. So let's outline the steps:

1. Find the hotel_id for Sheraton Ottawa Hotel. Since the tools don't have SearchHotels, but have Search_Hotel_Destination, perhaps use that. Wait, Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it's for finding hotels by location, but the user is looking for a specific hotel. So query "Sheraton Ottawa Hotel" via Search_Hotel_Destination. Maybe the response includes the hotel_id.

2. Use hotel_id to get popular attractions near
