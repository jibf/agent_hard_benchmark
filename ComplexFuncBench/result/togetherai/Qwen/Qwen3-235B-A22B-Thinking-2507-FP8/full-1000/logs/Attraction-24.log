Okay, let's see. The user asked about the Amsterdam Dungeon after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Amsterdam Dungeon" as the query. The response gave me a list of products, and the first one was the correct one for Amsterdam with the slug "prmyetjnodj8-amsterdam-dungeon-admission".

Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug. The response has a lot of info. Now I need to present this in a clear, user-friendly way. Let me check the key points.

The description mentions an underground tour through dark rooms, interactive performances about Dutch history. Highlights include the Flying Dutchman, a 17th-century bar owner story, torture room, East India Company ship, Rembrandt's secrets, witchcraft, and a mirror maze.

Additional info: kids 0-2 free, language preferences at entrance, no large bags, wheelchair accessible but not full tour, bring ticket, possible cancellations, age 18+ or with adult.

Cancellation policy is free. Price is $26.26 USD. Reviews are positive, average 4.6/5. Unique selling points are the historical stories, interactive shows, torture room, and mirror maze.

I should structure this into sections: Overview, Highlights, Practical Info, Pricing, Reviews. Make sure to mention the key attractions and important details like age requirement and accessibility. Avoid jargon, keep it conversational. Check if all necessary info is covered without being too verbose.
