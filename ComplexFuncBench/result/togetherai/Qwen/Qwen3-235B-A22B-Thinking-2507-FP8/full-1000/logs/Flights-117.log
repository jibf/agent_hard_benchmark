Okay, let's see. The user wants to find the cheapest multi-stop flight from Hangzhou to Dallas with a layover in Seoul around November 30, 2024. Also, no overnight layovers, and then get the seat map.

First, I need to figure out the airports for Hangzhou, Seoul, and Dallas. So I should use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the correct location IDs. Let me check the tools available. Yes, Search_Flight_Location takes a query and returns the IDs.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for Hangzhou. The query would be "Hangzhou". Then do the same for Seoul and Dallas. Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs for the multi-stop flight.

The legs should be Hangzhou to Seoul, then Seoul to Dallas. The date for the first leg is around November 30, but since the user says "around", maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function can help find the cheapest dates within 5 days before and after. Wait, the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight. So maybe first use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the flight details, including the offerToken needed for the seat map.

Wait, the user says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight". So first, find the cheapest dates using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. That API returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. The user's target date is November 30, 2024. So the legs would be from Hangzhou to Seoul on a date around Nov 30, then Seoul to Dallas on the next day (since no overnight layovers, the layover must be same day or very short). Wait, but the user says "don't accept flights with overnight layovers", so the layover in Seoul must be less than 24 hours, probably same day.

But first, need the location IDs. Let's start by getting the IDs for Hangzhou, Seoul, and Dallas.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location with query "Hangzhou".
Second: Search_Flight_Location with "Seoul".
Third: Search_Flight_Location with "Dallas".

Once we have the IDs, then use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs: [Hangzhou to Seoul on 2024-11-30, Seoul to Dallas on 2024-11-30 + 1 day? Wait, but the layover can't be overnight, so the second leg should depart on the same day as arrival from first leg. But flights take time, so maybe the second leg is the next day, but that would be an overnight layover. Wait, the user says no overnight layovers, so the layover must be within the same day. So the arrival in Seoul from Hangzhou must be on the same day as departure to Dallas. So the dates for the two legs would be the same? Or the second leg is the next day but within 24 hours? Hmm, but the user says "overnight layovers" are not accepted, so the layover should be less than, say, 12 hours, not spanning a night.

But maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will handle the dates. Let's proceed.

Assuming we have the location IDs, the legs array would be:

[
  { "fromId": "Hangzhou_ID", "toId": "Seoul_ID", "date": "2024-11-30" },
  { "fromId": "Seoul_ID", "toId": "Dallas_ID", "date": "2024-11-30" }
]

Wait, but the second leg's date would have to be after the first leg's arrival. If the first flight arrives in Seoul on Nov 30, the second flight must depart Seoul on Nov 30 as well. So both legs on the same date. But maybe the API allows that.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So for each leg, it checks dates around the specified date.

Wait, the legs array in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops requires each leg to have a date. So for the first leg (Hangzhou to Seoul), date is 2024-11-30, and the second leg (Seoul to Dallas) would be the next day, but the user doesn't want overnight layovers, so maybe the second leg's date is also 2024-11-30. But that might not be possible if the first flight arrives late. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the user means that the layover in Seoul should not require an overnight stay, so the total layover time is less than, say, 12 hours. So the second leg's date would be the same as the first leg's date if the first flight arrives early enough, or the next day but within 24 hours. But the user says "don't accept flights with overnight layovers", which probably means the layover is less than 24 hours, but not necessarily same day. Wait, an overnight layover would be staying overnight, so if the layover is 10 hours, that's not overnight. If it's 20 hours, maybe it's considered overnight. The user's exact requirement is "don't accept flights with overnight layovers", so we need to ensure that the layover time is less than, say, 12 hours, so that it's not overnight.

But the API parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops don't have a parameter for layover duration. So perhaps after getting the flight options, we have to filter them, but the user is asking to look for the cheapest flight with no overnight layovers, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will return the cheapest options, and then when we get the flight details via Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, we can check the layover duration.

But the user's main request is to first find the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight (so using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops), then get the seat map for that flight.

So steps:

1. Get location IDs for Hangzhou, Seoul, Dallas using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs: Hangzhou to Seoul on 2024-11-30, Seoul to Dallas on 2024-11-30 (or maybe the next day, but need to check).
3. From the response, get the cheapest flight's dates and offerToken.
4. Then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the offerToken (if not already available), then use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

Wait, but Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the minimum price, but does it return the offerToken? The description says "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." So maybe it returns the flight details including offerToken. Let me check the function definition.

Looking at Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops parameters: it requires legs, cabinClass. The response isn't specified, but assuming it returns flight options with offerTokens. Then, once we have the offerToken from that response, we can call Get_Seat_Map.

But the user wants the seat map for the flight, so we need the offerToken. So first, get the location IDs, then call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flight (which would give the offerToken), then use that offerToken in Get_Seat_Map.

But the user also says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight". So the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will return the dates (possibly adjusted within 5 days) that are cheapest.

So the plan is:

- Call Search_Flight_Location for Hangzhou, Seoul, Dallas to get their IDs.
- Use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs on 2024-11-30 (and possibly next day for second leg, but need to structure legs correctly).
- Then use the offerToken from the response to get the seat map.

Wait, but the legs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops need to have dates. The user says "depart from Hangzhou to Dallas around November 30, 2024, with a layover in Seoul". So the first leg (Hangzhou to Seoul) is around Nov 30, and the second leg (Seoul to Dallas) would be shortly after, same day or next day but not overnight.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's legs require each leg to have a date. So for the first leg, date is 2024-11-30, and the second leg's date would be 2024-11-30 or 2024-12-01. But since the user doesn't want overnight layovers, the second leg should depart on the same day as the first leg's arrival. So if the first flight arrives in Seoul on Nov 30, the second flight must depart Seoul on Nov 30. So both legs have the same date.

But maybe the API allows that. So legs would be:

[
  {"fromId": "Hangzhou_ID", "toId": "Seoul_ID", "date": "2024-11-30"},
  {"fromId": "Seoul_ID",
