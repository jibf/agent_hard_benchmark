2025-08-13 22:05:18,340 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-29 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about Times Square after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Times Square" as the query. That gave me a product called "Times Square Photoshoot" with a specific slug.

Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to get more info. The response has details like description, price, cancellation policy, etc. Now I need to present this info in a helpful way.

The user mentioned it's "dope" on social media, so they're probably interested in cool experiences there. The photoshoot is a tour offering professional photos. I should highlight key points: what it includes, price, cancellation, accessibility. Maybe mention it's bookable and the operator is Picster.

Check if there's anything else they might need. The user didn't ask for booking, just info, so focus on summarizing the details clearly. Make sure to mention the price in USD, free cancellation, and the included features like high-quality photos and local guide. Also note accessibility info since that's important for some travelers.

Avoid technical terms, keep it conversational. Maybe start with confirming it's a photoshoot experience, then list the main points. Make sure to answer their request for detailed info without overwhelming them.
