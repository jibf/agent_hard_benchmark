2025-08-13 22:05:04,855 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-27 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about the Taj Mahal after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Taj Mahal" as the query. The response gave me a product slug: prfifggbsxmu-glimpses-of-taj-mahal. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug.

Now, looking at the data from Get_Attraction_Details. The name is "Glimpses of Taj Mahal", which is a tour package. The description mentions a day trip including Taj Mahal and Agra Fort. It's operated by RAFAEL TOURS. The price is $9.71 USD, which seems low, maybe a starting price or a specific offer. There's free cancellation, which is good. The additional info lists accessibility details, like wheelchair access and fitness requirements. Also, pickup from Delhi airport and nearby areas.

The user probably wants key details: what the tour includes, price, duration, highlights. They might be interested in booking, so mentioning the free cancellation and inclusions like private guide and lunch is important. Also, note the location is near New Delhi, but Taj Mahal is in Agra, so maybe clarify that the tour starts from Delhi. Should check if there's any confusion between New Delhi as the city name in the data versus Agra's location. Wait, the ufiDetails says bCityName is New Delhi, but Taj Mahal is in Agra. Maybe the tour departs from Delhi. Need to present that clearly.

Also, the user said "That's dope," so they're excited, maybe looking for a cool experience. Highlight the iconic landmarks, private guide, Mughlai cuisine. Mention the not-included items like tips and other meals so they know extra costs. Make sure to structure the info clearly: overview, inclusions, price, practical info. Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and informative.
