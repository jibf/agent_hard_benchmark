Okay, let's see. The user wants to check the detailed info of the fastest flight from Beijing to Toronto on September 20, 2024, and also hotel availability within 10 km of the airport that day.

First, I need to figure out the steps. For the flight part, they mentioned "fastest flight," so I should use the Search_Flights function with sort set to FASTEST. But to get the flight details, I need the token from Search_Flights. Wait, the Get_Flight_Details function requires a token from Search_Flights or Search_FlightsMultiStops. So first, I need to search for flights from Beijing to Toronto on that date, sorted by fastest.

But to do that, I need the airport IDs for Beijing and Toronto. The user didn't provide them, so I should use Search_Flight_Location to get the location IDs. Let me check the tools. The Search_Flight_Location function takes a query like city names. So first, call Search_Flight_Location with "Beijing" and "Toronto" to get their IDs.

Wait, the user said "from Beijing to Toronto," so I need to get the fromId and toId. So first, two calls to Search_Flight_Location: one for Beijing, one for Toronto. But maybe each call will return the correct airport. For example, Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) and Toronto Pearson (YYZ). But the function will handle that.

So step 1: Search_Flight_Location with query "Beijing" to get fromId.
Step 2: Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get toId.

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights with departDate 2024-09-20, sort FASTEST. That will give the token needed for Get_Flight_Details.

Once I have the token from Search_Flights, call Get_Flight_Details with that token to get the detailed info like baggage, meals, etc.

Now for the hotels: need hotels within 10 km of the airport (Toronto airport, since the flight arrives there) on arrival date September 20, 2024. But the departure date for the flight is the same as arrival? Wait, the flight is from Beijing to Toronto on Sept 20, so arrival in Toronto would be same day or next day depending on time zones, but the user says "on that day," so arrival date is Sept 20. The hotel check-in would be Sept 20, departure maybe Sept 21? But the user says "on that day," so maybe arrival_date is 2024-09-20 and departure_date is 2024-09-21. But the user didn't specify duration, so maybe assume one night. However, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires arrival_date and departure_date. So need to set arrival_date as 2024-09-20 and departure_date as 2024-09-21.

But to get the coordinates of the Toronto airport, need to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport's address or name. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location for Toronto would give the airport details, which might include the address. But the Location_to_Lat_Long function can take the airport name. Alternatively, after getting the Toronto airport ID from Search_Flight_Location, maybe the response includes the coordinates, but the tools don't specify that. The tools for Search_Flight_Location's description says it returns airports by location, etc., but the parameters for Location_to_Lat_Long require a query string.

So perhaps after getting the Toronto airport name from Search_Flight_Location, use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name (e.g., "Toronto Pearson International Airport") to get latitude and longitude.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location function's response isn't detailed here, but the parameters for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates need latitude and longitude, which can be retrieved from Location_to_Lat_Long.

So steps for hotels:

1. Get Toronto airport's coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Toronto Pearson International Airport" or similar.

But how do I know the exact name? Maybe the Search_Flight_Location for Toronto returns the airport name, which can then be used in Location_to_Lat_Long.

So first, after getting the toId for Toronto via Search_Flight_Location, perhaps the response includes the airport name. But since we can't see the response structure, maybe the safest way is to first call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto, which would return possible locations, then take the main airport (like YYZ) and use its name in Location_to_Lat_Long.

Alternatively, maybe directly use "Toronto" in Location_to_Lat_Long, but that might give the city center, not the airport. So better to get the specific airport's coordinates.

This is getting a bit complex. Let's outline the required tool calls step by step.

First, for flights:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Beijing" to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get toId.
3. Use those IDs in Search_Flights with departDate 2024-09-20, sort FASTEST.
4. From Search_Flights response, get the token and call Get_Flight_Details.

For hotels:

5. Need coordinates of Toronto airport. So after step 2, we have the Toronto airport details. Suppose the Search_Flight_Location for Toronto returns the airport name (e.g., "Toronto Pearson International Airport"), then call Location_to_Lat_Long with that name to get lat/long.
6. Then call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-09-20, departure_date 2024-09-21 (assuming one night stay), radius 10 km, and the lat/long from step 5.

But the user says "within 10 kilometers of the airport", so radius=10.

Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates parameters require arrival_date, departure_date, latitude, longitude. So need to set those.

But the user didn't specify check-out date, so maybe assume same day? But hotels usually require at least one night. So arrival_date is 2024-09-20, departure_date 2024-09-21.

Now, the problem is that each tool call has to be made step by step, and the assistant can only call the tools, not see the responses. So the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls in order.

So first, the assistant should call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and Toronto to get their IDs.

Wait, the user query is to check the flight from Beijing to Toronto, so need both from and to locations.

So first two tool calls: Search_Flight_Location for "Beijing" and "Toronto".

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights with sort FASTEST.

Then, get the token from Search_Flights response to call Get_Flight_Details.

For hotels, need to get the coordinates of Toronto airport. So after getting Toronto's airport info from Search_Flight_Location, perhaps the name is known, then call Location_to_Lat_Long with that name.

But since the assistant can't see the response, it has to assume that Search_Flight_Location for Toronto returns the correct airport name, which can then be used in Location_to_Lat_Long.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location for Toronto returns the airport code (like YYZ), but the Location_to_Lat_Long might need the full name.

This is a bit of a guess, but the assistant has to proceed with the available tools.

So the necessary tool calls in order:

1. Search_Flight_Location("Beijing")
2. Search_Flight_Location("Toronto")
3. Search_Flights with fromId (from step1), toId (from step2), departDate 2024-09-20, sort FASTEST
4. Get_Flight_Details with token from step3
5. Location_to_Lat_Long("Toronto Pearson International Airport") [assuming that's the main airport]
6. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-09-20, departure_date 2024-09-21, radius 10, and lat/long from step5

But the user didn't specify the return date for flights, but since it's a one-way flight (they mention "from Beijing to Toronto on September 20"), so returnDate is not needed. The Search_Flights requires departDate, which is provided.

Wait, the Search_Flights parameters: required are toId, fromId, departDate. So that's covered.

Now, the assistant needs to make these calls step by step. However, in the current setup, the assistant can call multiple tools in one response, but each in separate tool_call tags.

But according to the instructions, for each function call, return a json object within tool_call tags.

So the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and Toronto.

Wait, but the user's query is about a flight from Beijing to Toronto, so need both locations.

So first, two Search_Flight_Location calls: one for Beijing, one for Toronto.

Then, use those IDs to call Search_Flights.

But since the assistant can't proceed without the IDs, the first step is to get those.

So the first tool calls should be:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Beijing"
- Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto"

Then, once those are done, use the IDs to search flights.

But in the current problem, the assistant has to output the tool calls needed for the first step
