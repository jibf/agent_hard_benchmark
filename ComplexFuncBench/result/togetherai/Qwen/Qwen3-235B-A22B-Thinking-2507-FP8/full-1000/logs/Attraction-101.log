Okay, let's see. The user asked for tour routes in Beijing and detailed info on sightseeing activities. I first used Search_Attraction_Location with "Beijing" to get the location ID. Then, I used Search_Attractions with that ID sorted by attr_book_score to find popular tours. The top result was the Forbidden City tour. Now, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from that result to get more details.

Looking at the response, the tour is a 4-hour small group tour to the Forbidden City with entry tickets. It includes a professional guide, entrance fees, and options for Tian'anmen Square or Coal Hill Park. The description mentions it's good for history and culture lovers, with a focus on stories and major buildings. The group size is limited to 10 people. There are cancellation policies, requirements like bringing a passport, and some restrictions for people with mobility issues.

I need to present this info clearly. Start with the tour name, highlight key details like duration, inclusions, price, and important notes. Mention the high rating and reviews. Also, note the alternatives if Tian'anmen Square is closed. Make sure to structure it so the user gets all necessary info without being overwhelmed. Check if there's anything else the user might need, but since they asked for detailed info, this should cover it.
