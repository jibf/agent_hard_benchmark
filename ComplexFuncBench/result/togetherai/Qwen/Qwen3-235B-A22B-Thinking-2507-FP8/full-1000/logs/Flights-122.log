Okay, let's see. The user wants to travel to Portland and Denver, staying 3 days in each, then return to Seattle. They're unsure about the order of Portland and Denver. They need the cheapest flight around December 5th, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the flight itinerary. Since they're visiting two cities and returning to Seattle, it's a multi-stop trip. The possible routes are Seattle -> Portland -> Denver -> Seattle or Seattle -> Denver -> Portland -> Seattle. But wait, the user mentioned staying 3 days in each place, so the total trip would be 6 days plus travel days. Wait, they need to leave around December 5th. Wait, the user says "departure date of the cheapest flight around December 5th, 2024". So the departure from Seattle is around Dec 5.

Wait, the user is in Seattle, going to Portland and Denver, each for 3 days, then back to Seattle. So the trip would be: Depart Seattle on Dec 5 (approx), go to first city (Portland or Denver), stay 3 days, then go to the second city, stay 3 days, then return to Seattle.

So the legs would be:

Option 1: SEA -> PDX (Dec 5), PDX -> DEN (Dec 8), DEN -> SEA (Dec 11)

Option 2: SEA -> DEN (Dec 5), DEN -> PDX (Dec 8), PDX -> SEA (Dec 11)

But the user wants the cheapest flight around Dec 5. So we need to check both options and find which has the lower price.

But to get the flight details, we need to use the multi-stop search. The available functions are Search_Flights_Multi_Stops and Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

The user is asking for the departure date of the cheapest flight around Dec 5. Wait, "around December 5th" probably means the departure from Seattle is around that date. But since it's a multi-stop, the first leg's date is Dec 5, then the next legs are 3 days later each.

Wait, the user says "staying 3 days in each place", so if they arrive in Portland on Dec 5, they'd stay until Dec 8, then leave for Denver on Dec 8, stay until Dec 11, then return to Seattle on Dec 11.

So the legs are:

Leg 1: SEA to first city on Dec 5

Leg 2: first city to second city on Dec 8

Leg 3: second city to SEA on Dec 11

But the user hasn't decided the order, so we need to check both orders.

To find the cheapest option, maybe using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops would help, as it returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. But the user specified "around December 5th", so maybe the first leg's date is Dec 5, but the API can check ±5 days.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if we set the date as Dec 5, it will check from Nov 30 to Dec 10.

But the user wants the departure date (of the cheapest flight) around Dec 5. So perhaps using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for both possible itineraries (SEA-PDX-DEN-SEA and SEA-DEN-PDX-SEA) to find which has the lower price, then get the details.

But first, we need the location IDs for SEA, PDX, DEN.

Wait, the user mentioned Portland and Denver. Portland's airport is PDX, Denver is DEN, Seattle is SEA.

But to get the correct location IDs, we should use Search_Flight_Location to confirm. For example, search for "Portland" to get the correct airport ID, same for Denver and Seattle.

Wait, the user is departing from Seattle, so the origin is SEA. But need to confirm the exact IDs.

So first step: Use Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle", "Portland", "Denver" to get their airport codes or IDs.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location function's description says it returns location IDs which are used in other flight APIs. The parameters require a query string.

So, for example, query "Seattle" to get SEA.AIRPORT or similar.

Assuming that the IDs are like SEA.AIRPORT, PDX.AIRPORT, DEN.AIRPORT.

But to be precise, we need to call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But the user hasn't provided specific airports, so we need to get the correct IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle", "Portland", "Denver".

Wait, but the user is asking for the flight details, so the first step is to get the location IDs.

But the user's main request is to find the cheapest multi-stop flight around Dec 5, 2024.

So the plan is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the correct fromId and toId for Seattle, Portland, Denver.

2. For both possible itineraries (SEA->PDX->DEN->SEA and SEA->DEN->PDX->SEA), use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the minimum price.

3. Compare the two options and pick the cheaper one.

4. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the detailed flight info for the cheapest option.

But the user specifically asked for the departure date of the cheapest flight around Dec 5. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might return the minimum price and the dates, but the user wants the detailed info, so perhaps after finding the cheapest option via Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, we need to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the specific dates to get the details.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after, but the user wants the departure date (i.e., the actual date of the flight that is cheapest). So maybe Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will give the best date and price, then we can use that date to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for details.

But the user's main goal is to get the detailed information for the cheapest flight around Dec 5.

So steps:

- Determine the correct location IDs for SEA, PDX, DEN using Search_Flight_Location.

- For each possible route (two permutations), call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs for the three segments (SEA to first city, first to second, second to SEA), with dates spaced 3 days apart (Dec 5, Dec 8, Dec 11), but allowing the API to check ±5 days.

Wait, but the user said "around December 5th", so the first leg's date is around Dec 5. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's legs parameter requires date for each leg. However, the function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, the parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops include legs, each with a date. But the function's description says it checks 5 days before and after the query date. So perhaps for each leg's date, it checks ±5 days. But the user wants the first departure around Dec 5, so the first leg's date is Dec 5, and the API will check from Nov 30 to Dec 10 for that leg.

But the user is staying 3 days in each city, so the next legs should be 3 days after the previous arrival. However, the API might adjust the dates to find the cheapest combination.

Wait, the problem is that the user wants to stay 3 days in each city, so the dates for the legs are fixed relative to each other. For example, if the first leg is on Dec 5, the second leg should be on Dec 8, third on Dec 11. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might look for the cheapest combination where the dates are within 5 days of the specified dates. So if the user specifies legs with dates Dec 5, Dec 8, Dec 11, the API will check for flights departing between Nov 30-Dec 10 for the first leg, then the next legs would be adjusted accordingly.

But the user wants the stay to be 3 days, so the dates between legs should be exactly 3 days. However, the API might find a cheaper option if the dates are slightly adjusted, but the user probably wants to stick to 3 days in each city. Hmm, this is a bit unclear.

The user says "staying 3 days in each place", so the time between arrival in a city and departure to the next should be 3 days. So if they arrive in Portland on Dec 5, they leave on Dec 8. So the second leg's date is Dec 8.

Therefore, the legs would have dates Dec 5, Dec 8, Dec 11.

But the user says "around December 5th", so maybe the first leg's date can be a few days before or after, but the stays are still 3 days each.

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if we set the first leg's date as Dec 5, it will check from Nov 30 to Dec 10 for the first leg, and presumably the subsequent legs would be adjusted to maintain the 3-day stay? Or does the API expect the dates to be fixed, and it checks around
