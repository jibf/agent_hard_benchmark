Okay, let's see. The user is asking about ticket availability for attractions in Vancouver and Copenhagen on November 30, 2024, specifically looking for free entry for their 13-year-old.

First, I called Search_Attraction_Location for both cities. Got the IDs for Vancouver (eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9) and Copenhagen (eyJ1ZmkiOi0yNzQ1NjM2fQ==). Then tried to use Search_Attractions with those IDs and sortBy trending. But the Vancouver call returned an error, while Copenhagen worked.

Wait, the Vancouver Search_Attractions response says "api_status": true but the content mentions a problem. Maybe the ID was incorrect? Let me check the first tool response. For Vancouver, the id was "eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9", which is a base64 string. Maybe it's correct. But the error says there's a problem with the API call. Maybe the parameters were wrong? The required parameter is id, which was provided. Hmm.

Wait, the user wants free entry for a 13-year-old. So I need to check if attractions have free entry for children. The Search_Attractions gives product details, but maybe the free cancellation or other policies don't indicate child pricing. Maybe I need to get attraction details for each to check their policies.

But first, the Vancouver Search_Attractions failed. Let me check the parameters again. The function requires id and sortBy. The id from Search_Attraction_Location for Vancouver was "eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9", which was used. Maybe the API expects a different format? Or maybe the id is correct but the API has an issue. Since Copenhagen worked, maybe Vancouver's id is correct but the API is having issues. Alternatively, maybe the id is for the destination, but the Search_Attractions needs a product id? Wait, no—the description says id can be retrieved from searchLocation as id inside products or destinations. So the destination id should be correct.

Wait, the error message says "There is a problem with your api call, please double-check for possible problems." Maybe the sortBy parameter is required? The function requires id, but sortBy is optional. Wait, looking back at the function definition for Search_Attractions: required is ["id"], sortBy is optional. So maybe the API expects sortBy to be provided, but the user didn't specify. Wait, in the tool call, I included sortBy: "trending", which is in the enum. So that should be okay.

Hmm. Maybe the Vancouver id is incorrect. Let me check the first tool response again. The Vancouver destination id was "eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9", which is base64 for {"ufi":-575268}. The Copenhagen one was "eyJ1ZmkiOi0yNzQ1NjM2fQ==" which decodes to {"ufi":-2745636}. Maybe the API expects the ufi as a number, but the id is a string. Wait, the function parameters say id is a string, so passing the base64 string should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the Vancouver API is down or has no data. But the user needs to know availability. Since the Vancouver call failed, perhaps I should retry with a different sortBy or check if there's another way.

Wait, the user specifically wants free entry for a 13-year-old. So even if I get the attractions, I need to check if they offer free entry for that age. The Search_Attractions response for Copenhagen shows a museum with a price, but no info on child pricing. So maybe I need to get the attraction details for each to see their policies.

But first, let's handle the Vancouver error. Maybe the id was wrong. Wait, in the first tool response for Vancouver, the destinations array has two entries: Vancouver and Whistler. The id for Vancouver is "eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9", which is correct. Maybe the API requires the ufi instead of the id? But the function says to use the id from searchLocation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the sortBy parameter is not allowed for that id. But the enum includes "trending", which was used.

Hmm. Since the Vancouver call failed, but Copenhagen worked, perhaps I should proceed with Copenhagen first and then try another approach for Vancouver.

For Copenhagen, the Search_Attractions returned a product: National Museum of Denmark. Now, to check if it offers free entry for 13-year-olds, I need to get the attraction details using Get_Attraction_Details with the slug. The slug from the product is "przj4k2mud0c-national-museum-of-denmark".

So next step: call Get_Attraction_Details for that slug. Then check the details for child pricing.

Similarly, for Vancouver, even though the Search_Attractions failed, maybe try another id or check if there's another way. Wait, maybe the id for Vancouver is correct, but the API requires a different parameter. Alternatively, maybe the problem was a temporary error, so retrying might help. But since the user is waiting, perhaps proceed with what's available.

Wait, the user asked for both cities. Since Vancouver's Search_Attractions failed, maybe try using the other id from Vancouver's searchLocation response. The first response had two destinations: Vancouver (id: eyJ1ZmkiOi01NzUyNjh9) and Whistler (id: eyJ1ZmkiOjkwMDAwMDAwMX0=). Maybe the user meant Vancouver, but perhaps the API expects a different id. Wait, no—the user specified Vancouver, so the first id is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the sortBy parameter is not needed, but the function allows it. Wait, the function's required is only id, so maybe omitting sortBy would work. Let me check the function definition again: parameters have required ["id"], sortBy is optional. So perhaps the API doesn't accept sortBy for that endpoint, but the function says it does. Maybe the error was due to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the id is supposed to be the ufi number, not the base64 string. Wait, the description says: "id can be retrieved from api/v1/attraction/searchLocation... as id inside products or destinations." In the tool response, the id is the base64 string, so that's what should be used.

Hmm. This is tricky. Since the Vancouver call failed, but Copenhagen worked, perhaps proceed with Copenhagen first, then try to figure out Vancouver.

So for Copenhagen, next step is to get the attraction details for the National Museum to check child pricing. Then check availability for November 30.

Wait, the user also needs to check availability on that date. So after getting the slug, call Get_Availability with slug and date.

But first, need to confirm if the attraction offers free entry for 13-year-olds. The Get_Attraction_Details might have that info.

So steps for Copenhagen:

1. Get_Attraction_Details with slug "przj4k2mud0c-national-museum-of-denmark"
2. Check if there's info on child pricing (free for 13-year-old)
3. If yes, call Get_Availability for that slug on 2024-11-30

Similarly for Vancouver, but since Search_Attractions failed, maybe try another approach. Maybe use Search_Attraction_Location again but with more specific query, or check if there's another id.

Wait, maybe the Vancouver Search_Attractions failed because the sortBy parameter was included. Let me check the function definition again. The function's parameters for Search_Attractions have sortBy as optional, with enum values. So including it should be okay. But maybe the API expects a different value. Wait, the enum is ["trending", "attr_book_score", "lowest_price"], and "trending" is valid.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the id is for a destination with no attractions, but the productCount was 405, so that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe the error is a red herring, and the actual data is there. Wait, the api_status is true, but the content says there's a problem. Maybe it's a false positive. Let me check the response structure. The Vancouver response has "api_status": true, but the content is an error message. That's odd. Maybe the API returns true status even when there's an error in the content. So perhaps the call was invalid.

Wait, looking at the Vancouver tool response:

{"api_status": true, "content": "There is a problem with your api call, please double-check for possible problems."}

This suggests that even though the API status is true, the content indicates an error. So the parameters were incorrect.

Possible reasons: the id is wrong, or sortBy is not applicable. Wait, maybe the id should be the ufi number as a string, not the base64. Let's see: the Vancouver ufi is -575268. Maybe the id parameter expects the ufi, not the base64 string. But the function description says: "id can be retrieved from ... as id inside products or destinations." In the tool response, the id is the base64 string, so that's what should be used.

Alternatively, maybe the id needs to be URL-decoded or something. But the example given in the function description uses the id from the searchLocation response, which is the base64 string.

This is confusing. Maybe the Vancouver API is case-sensitive or has a different
