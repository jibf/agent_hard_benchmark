2025-08-13 22:04:00,887 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-21 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about the Arc de Triomphe after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with the query "Arc de Triomphe" to find the relevant attraction. The response gave me a product with a slug, which I then used in Get_Attraction_Details.

Now, looking at the data from Get_Attraction_Details, I need to present the key details in a clear and helpful way. The user probably wants to know what the attraction is, its location, what the tour includes, pricing, cancellation policy, and any important notes.

The name of the product is "Arc de Triomphe : Private guided tour with ticket included". The description mentions a 2-hour private tour, history, architecture, and panoramic views. The location is Paris, France. The price is $410.38 USD. Cancellation is free, which is a plus. They include entrance tickets and a guide, but not transportation or food. There are some accessibility notes: 284 steps, elevator available for those who need it, not wheelchair accessible. Also, service animals allowed and public transport nearby.

I should structure this info so it's easy to read. Start with a brief overview, then key details like location, price, inclusions, cancellation, accessibility, and any other important points. Make sure to mention the highlights like the panoramic views and the guided tour aspect since the user found it "dope" on social media, so emphasizing the experience would be good.

Check if there's anything missing. The user might also want to know how to book, but since the isBookable is true, maybe mention that it's bookable. Also, the reviews total is 0, so maybe note that there are no reviews yet. But the user didn't ask for reviews, so maybe skip that unless relevant.

Make sure to present the info in a friendly, conversational tone without markdown. Avoid technical terms like slug or productId. Focus on what the user cares about: what they'll experience, cost, what's included, and practical info like accessibility.
