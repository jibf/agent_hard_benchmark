Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to check the fastest plane tickets for two separate trips: Toronto to New York on Nov 8, 2024, and New York to Washington on Nov 10, 2024. They also need hotels near the airports in New York and Washington within 10 km.

First, I need to find the flight details. But to search flights, I need the airport IDs for Toronto, New York, and Washington. The user mentioned "New York" and "Washington," but airports have specific codes. So I should use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the correct airport IDs.

Starting with Toronto. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto". That should give me the departure airport ID for the first leg. Then, for New York, same thing: query "New York" to get the arrival airport ID for the first flight and departure for the second. Similarly, Washington needs a query for its airport.

Wait, the user said "arrival airports of the flights" for the hotels. So for the first flight (Toronto to NY), the arrival airport in NY is where they'll stay, so hotels near that airport. Then for the second flight (NY to Washington), hotels near Washington's arrival airport.

So steps:

1. Get Toronto's airport ID (fromId for first flight).
2. Get New York's airport ID (toId for first flight, fromId for second).
3. Get Washington's airport ID (toId for second flight).

Use Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Then, search flights for Toronto to NY on Nov 8 with sort=FASTEST. Then NY to Washington on Nov 10, also FASTEST.

After getting flight details, need to get the exact airport coordinates to search hotels. Wait, the hotel search requires latitude and longitude. So for each arrival airport (NY and Washington), need to get their coordinates. But how?

Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates function needs latitude and longitude. To get those, maybe use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name? But airports are specific. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location returns coordinates? Let me check the function descriptions.

Looking at Search_Flight_Location: it's for finding airports by location, etc., and returns an ID. The parameters for Search_Flights require fromId and toId, which are from this endpoint. But the endpoint's response isn't specified here. However, the Location_to_Lat_Long function can take a query (like airport name) to get lat/long.

So after getting the airport IDs, perhaps we need to get the actual airport names or locations to query Location_to_Lat_Long. Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location might return the airport name or city, which can then be used to get lat/long.

Alternatively, maybe the airport ID corresponds to a location that can be queried. But the user might not know the exact airport name, so using the city name for Location_to_Lat_Long might give the city's coordinates, but airports are sometimes outside the city. Hmm, this could be a problem.

Wait, the user wants hotels within 10 km of the related airports. So the coordinates should be of the airport itself, not the city. So perhaps after getting the airport ID from Search_Flight_Location, we need to find the airport's exact location to get its lat/long.

But how? The Search_Flight_Location function's description says it returns the airport's ID, but maybe the response includes the airport name or coordinates. However, since the tool's parameters don't specify that, maybe we have to assume that the airport name can be used in Location_to_Lat_Long.

For example, if Search_Flight_Location for "New York" returns JFK, LGA, EWR, etc., then we need to pick the correct one. But the user didn't specify which airport, so maybe the flight search will return the specific airport, and then we can use that airport's name (like "John F. Kennedy International Airport") in Location_to_Lat_Long to get its coordinates.

But since the user hasn't provided specific airports, the flight search might return multiple options, but the user wants the fastest flight, which might use a particular airport.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps:

1. For Toronto to NY flight:
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location with "Toronto" to get fromId.
   b. Use Search_Flight_Location with "New York" to get toId.
   c. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-08, sort=FASTEST.

2. For NY to Washington flight:
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location with "New York" (same as before) for fromId.
   b. Use Search_Flight_Location with "Washington" for toId.
   c. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-10, sort=FASTEST.

But wait, the user said "book the tickets separately", so two separate flight searches.

After getting the flight details, we need the arrival airport for each flight to find hotels. So for the first flight, arrival airport in NY, and for the second, arrival in Washington.

But to get the hotel coordinates, we need the airport's lat/long. So for each arrival airport (from the flight search results), we need to get their coordinates. However, the flight search results might include the airport code or name, which we can then use in Location_to_Lat_Long.

But since we don't have the actual flight data yet, we need to first get the flight details, which will include the specific airports (like JFK, DCA, etc.), then use those airport names to get lat/long.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the flight tokens yet. The Get_Flight_Details function requires a token from the Search_Flights response. So first, we need to call Search_Flights for both routes, get the tokens, then call Get_Flight_Details for each to get more info, but the user wants the details of the fastest tickets, so maybe the Search_Flights response already includes enough info, but the user specifically says "details" which might require Get_Flight_Details.

But the user's main request is to check the details, so perhaps after searching flights, we need to get the details using the token.

But the immediate step is to first get the flight locations (airport IDs) for the cities.

So first tool calls should be Search_Flight_Location for Toronto, New York, and Washington.

Wait, the user mentioned "New York" and "Washington", but there are multiple airports in those areas. For example, New York has JFK, EWR, LGA. Washington has DCA, IAD, BWI. So the Search_Flight_Location will return multiple IDs, but the flight search will handle which one is used based on the fastest route.

But for the purpose of getting the airport ID for the flight search, we need to pick the correct one. However, since the user didn't specify, the Search_Flight_Location might return a list, and the flight search would consider all possible airports in the area.

Assuming that the Search_Flight_Location function returns the appropriate airport IDs for the city, even if multiple, the flight search will handle it.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city:

- Toronto
- New York
- Washington

Then use those IDs to search flights.

After getting the flight results, we can get the specific arrival airports, then use Location_to_Lat_Long on those airport names to get coordinates for hotel search.

But since we don't have the airport names yet, maybe the flight search response includes the airport name, which we can then use.

But as per the tools provided, the next step is to first get the location IDs.

So the first tool calls should be three Search_Flight_Location queries.

Wait, the user is asking for two flight routes: Toronto to NY and NY to Washington. So need fromId and toId for each.

So first, get Toronto's airport ID (fromId for first flight), New York's (toId for first, fromId for second), Washington's (toId for second).

So three Search_Flight_Location calls:

1. query: "Toronto"
2. query: "New York"
3. query: "Washington"

Then use the results to call Search_Flights for each route.

After that, for each arrival airport (NY and Washington), get their coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long, then call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 10 km.

Wait, the user said "within 10 kilometers of the related airports", so radius=10.

Also, the stay is two days each, so arrival_date and departure_date for hotels would be:

For NY: arrival on Nov 8, departure Nov 10 (2 days)
For Washington: arrival on Nov 10, departure Nov 12 (2 days)

Wait, the user says "stay in New York and Washington for two days each". So first flight arrives Nov 8, stays two days (leaves Nov 10), then flies to Washington, arrives Nov 10, stays two days (leaves Nov 12).

So hotel in NY: arrival_date=2024-11-08, departure_date=2024-11-10

Hotel in Washington: arrival_date=2024-11-10, departure_date=2024-11-12

But need to confirm the dates based on flight arrival.

Assuming flights arrive on the same day, so NY hotel from Nov 8 to 10, Washington from Nov 10 to 12.

So
