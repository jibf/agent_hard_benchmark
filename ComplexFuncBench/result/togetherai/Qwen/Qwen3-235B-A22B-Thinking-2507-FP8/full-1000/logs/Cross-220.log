Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Houston on December 1, 2024, then Houston to Toronto two days later, which would be December 3. They want the fastest flights.

So, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. But before that, I need the correct airport IDs for Tokyo, Houston, and Toronto. The user mentioned Houston airport, so I should find the airport codes using Search_Flight_Location. Let me check that.

Wait, the user also wants to stay at Holiday Inn Houston Downtown. I need to check hotel availability. For that, I need the hotel_id from Search_Hotels or Search_Hotel_Destination. But first, maybe use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the location details for Houston, then Search_Hotels to find the specific hotel. Once I have the hotel_id, use Get_Room_List_With_Availability with arrival_date December 1 and departure_date December 3.

Additionally, they need a taxi from the hotel to Houston airport on December 3, three hours before the flight. So, first, I need the flight time from the multi-stop search to determine the pickup time. But since the user hasn't provided flight times yet, maybe the taxi pickup time depends on the flight schedule. However, the user says "three hours before my flight," so once the flight is booked, we can set the pickup time accordingly. But for the taxi search, we need the pickup and drop-off place IDs. The hotel's location for pickup would need a googlePlaceId, which can be obtained via Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel address. The drop-off is Houston airport, so need its googlePlaceId from Taxi_Search_Location as well.

Wait, the user mentioned "Houston airport" so I need to find the correct airport's googlePlaceId. But first, let's handle the flights.

Step 1: Find airport IDs for Tokyo, Houston, Toronto using Search_Flight_Location.

For Tokyo: query "Tokyo" to get the airport ID (like NRT or HND).
Houston: query "Houston" to get IAH or HOU.
Toronto: query "Toronto" to get YYZ.

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs:
First leg: from Tokyo ID to Houston ID on 2024-12-01
Second leg: from Houston ID to Toronto ID on 2024-12-03
Sort by FASTEST.

Once flights are found, get the departure time for the second flight (Houston to Toronto) to set the taxi pickup time as three hours before that.

But the user hasn't provided specific flight times yet, so maybe the taxi pickup time is based on the flight's departure time. However, since the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, we need to know the flight time. But since the flight hasn't been booked yet, perhaps the taxi arrangement is part of the booking process. Wait, the user says "Don't forget to arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Houston airport on the 3rd."

So, the taxi is for December 3, from the hotel to the airport. The pickup time is three hours before the flight departure time. But to get the flight departure time, we need to first search for the flights. So the steps are:

1. Search for multi-stop flights (Tokyo -> Houston on Dec 1, Houston -> Toronto on Dec 3), sort by FASTEST.
2. From the flight results, get the departure time of the second leg (Houston to Toronto).
3. Calculate pickup time as departure time minus 3 hours.
4. Then, search for taxi with pickup at hotel (need googlePlaceId for Holiday Inn Houston Downtown) and drop-off at Houston airport (googlePlaceId for IAH or HOU), on Dec 3 at the calculated pickup time.

But the user hasn't provided the flight time yet, so maybe the taxi arrangement is dependent on the flight booking. However, the user is asking to check hotel availability and arrange taxi as part of the same request.

So first, let's handle the flight search. But to do that, we need the airport IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo, Houston, Toronto.

Wait, the user mentioned "Houston airport" so maybe the specific airport is IAH (George Bush) or HOU (Hobby). Need to check which one is correct. But the Search_Flight_Location will return the correct IDs.

Similarly for Tokyo, it's either NRT or HND.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

Next, check hotel availability for Holiday Inn Houston Downtown. To do that, need to find the hotel_id. So first, use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Houston" to get the destination ID, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date Dec 1, departure_date Dec 3, and maybe filter by hotel name "Holiday Inn Houston Downtown". Once the hotel is found, get its hotel_id and call Get_Room_List_With_Availability.

Then, for the taxi, need to get googlePlaceId for the hotel (using Taxi_Search_Location with query "Holiday Inn Houston Downtown") and for Houston airport (Taxi_Search_Location with "Houston Airport"). Then, with the pickup time calculated from the flight departure time (which we get from the flight search), call Search_Taxi.

But since the flight search hasn't been done yet, the pickup time isn't known. However, the user says "three hours before my flight", so once the flight is booked, the time is known. But in the current step, we need to first get the flight details to know the departure time.

So the order of operations:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo, Houston, Toronto to get airport IDs.
2. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the fastest flights, which will give the departure time for the second leg (Houston to Toronto on Dec 3).
3. From the flight result, determine the pickup time (departure time - 3 hours).
4. Search_Hotel_Destination for Houston to get location data.
5. Search_Hotels to find Holiday Inn Houston Downtown, get hotel_id.
6. Check availability with Get_Room_List_With_Availability.
7. Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel and Houston airport to get place IDs.
8. Search_Taxi with those place IDs, pickup date Dec 3, pickup time as calculated.

But the user's request is to check hotel availability and arrange taxi, so all these steps are needed.

However, the assistant needs to make the function calls in the correct order. Since the user hasn't provided specific IDs, the first step is to get the necessary location IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo, Houston, Toronto.

Wait, the user mentioned "Houston airport" so maybe the query for Houston airport would be "Houston" but need to specify airport. However, the Search_Flight_Location function's description says it's for finding airports by location, etc. So querying "Houston" should return the airports in Houston.

Similarly for Tokyo and Toronto.

So first, three calls to Search_Flight_Location with queries "Tokyo", "Houston", "Toronto".

Then, use the returned IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

But the user wants the fastest flights, so sort by FASTEST.

Then, once flights are found, get the departure time of the second leg (Houston to Toronto) to set the taxi pickup time.

Then, for the hotel:

Call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Houston" to get the destination ID.

Then, Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date Dec 1, departure_date Dec 3, and maybe search_type or other parameters to find Holiday Inn Houston Downtown.

Once hotel_id is obtained, call Get_Room_List_With_Availability.

For the taxi:

Call Taxi_Search_Location for "Holiday Inn Houston Downtown" to get pickup place ID.

Call Taxi_Search_Location for "Houston Airport" to get drop-off place ID.

Then, with pickup time as flight departure time minus 3 hours, call Search_Taxi.

But since the flight departure time is not known until the flight search is done, the taxi search depends on that.

So the sequence of function calls should be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo
2. Search_Flight_Location for Houston
3. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto
4. Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the obtained IDs, sort FASTEST
5. From flight results, get second leg departure time
6. Search_Hotel_Destination for Houston
7. Search_Hotels to find Holiday Inn Houston Downtown
8. Get_Room_List_With_Availability for the hotel
9. Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel
10. Taxi_Search_Location for Houston Airport
11. Search_Taxi with calculated pickup time

But the user's current query is to check hotel availability and arrange taxi, so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls step by step.

However, the assistant can only make one set of tool calls at a time. Since the user hasn't provided any IDs, the first step is to get the location IDs for the airports and hotel.

Wait, the user mentioned "Holiday Inn Houston Downtown", so for the hotel, need to find its location. So first, Search_Hotel_Destination for "Houston" to get the destination ID, then Search_Hotels with that ID and the hotel name.

But the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc.

So let's outline the required function calls in order
