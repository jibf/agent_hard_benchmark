2025-08-13 22:25:43,661 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-105 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for tour routes in Madrid and detailed info on sightseeing activities. I first used Search_Attraction_Location with "Madrid" to get the location ID. Then, I called Search_Attractions with that ID sorted by trending to find popular attractions. The top result was the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium tour. Next, I used Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the previous response to get more details.

Now, I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants a summary of the attraction, including key details like price, what's included, restrictions, and reviews. Let me check the data from the last tool response. The stadium tour costs $37.90 USD, includes museum access, panoramic views, and has some restrictions like no wheelchairs and age limits for children. The reviews mention it's popular but some note construction affecting access.

I should structure the answer to highlight the main points: name, price, description, inclusions, restrictions, and notable reviews. Also, mention that it's a top trending attraction in Madrid. Maybe add a note about checking the official site for construction updates. Avoid technical jargon, keep it user-friendly. Make sure to mention the need for tickets in advance and the cancellation policy (no free cancellation). Also, point out the bestseller status to show popularity.

Wait, the user asked for "tour routes," but this is a single attraction. Maybe there are more attractions, but the user only got details on the top one. Should I mention that there are other options but this is the most popular? The Search_Attractions response had multiple products, but the user only retrieved details for the first one. Maybe the user expects more, but since the tool calls were sequential, perhaps the assistant should list this as the top recommendation and suggest further exploration if needed.

Also, check if there's any missing info. The response includes operating hours from July 2024, which is useful. Highlight the hours, the fact that it's self-guided, and the need to bring ID for discounts. Make sure to present all key points concisely without overwhelming the user. Maybe bullet points for clarity.
