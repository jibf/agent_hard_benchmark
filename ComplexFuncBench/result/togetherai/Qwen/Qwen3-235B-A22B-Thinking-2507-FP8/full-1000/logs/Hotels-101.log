Okay, let's tackle this user query. So, the user's friends are planning a trip to London from December 1st to 6th, 2024. They need a hotel near the British Museum that's also a beachfront hotel. Then, they want to know other nearby cities around that hotel for continuing their travels.

First, I need to check if there's a beachfront hotel near the British Museum in London. Wait, London isn't a beachfront city. The British Museum is in central London, which is inland. Beachfront hotels are usually by the coast, but London is on the River Thames, not the sea. So maybe the user is confused. But I should verify.

The first step is to search for hotels in London near the British Museum. But the user specified "beachfront," which might not exist there. However, maybe they meant something else, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's proceed with the tools provided.

The tools available include Search_Hotel_Destination, which can find locations. So, I should first use Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "British Museum, London" to get the destination ID and coordinates. Then, use Search_Hotels with that destination ID, arrival and departure dates, and check if any beachfront options exist. But beachfront might be a filter category. Wait, the Search_Hotels function has a categories_filter parameter, which can be retrieved from Get_Filter. So maybe first, I need to get the categories_filter for beachfront.

Wait, the user is asking for a beachfront hotel near the British Museum. But since London isn't coastal, this might not be possible. However, maybe the user is mistaken, and I need to handle that. But as per the task, I should use the tools to find out.

So step 1: Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London" to get the dest_id and coordinates.

Then, use Get_Filter to get the categories_filter options, maybe including beachfront. But beachfront might not be available in London. Alternatively, maybe the user meant something else, like a hotel with a pool or near a river, but they said beachfront.

Assuming the user insists on beachfront, but London doesn't have beaches, the search might return no results. However, the assistant should proceed with the tools.

So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London" to get the location details.

Then, use Search_Hotels with the dest_id from the first step, arrival_date 2024-12-01, departure_date 2024-12-06, and try to apply a beachfront filter. But to get the correct categories_filter, maybe need to call Get_Filter first with the dest_id, arrival, departure dates, etc.

Wait, the Get_Filter function requires search_type, dest_id, departure_date, arrival_date. So perhaps first, after getting dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination, call Get_Filter to see what categories are available, including beachfront.

But the user is asking for beachfront, so maybe the categories_filter would include that. However, in London, beachfront might not be an option. But the assistant has to follow the process.

So the steps would be:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London" to get dest_id and coordinates.

2. Use that dest_id in Get_Filter to retrieve possible categories_filter, including beachfront.

3. Then, use Search_Hotels with the dest_id, dates, and the beachfront filter.

But if beachfront isn't available, the Search_Hotels might return no results, but the user might need to be informed. However, the task is to use the tools as per the query.

After finding the hotel (even if it's not beachfront, but the user asked for it), then find nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities with the hotel's coordinates.

Wait, but the hotel's coordinates would come from the Search_Hotels response. However, the Search_Hotels function's description says it returns hotel details, which might include coordinates. But the tools don't specify that. Alternatively, the Search_Hotel_Destination gives latitude and longitude for the search query.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's description says: "This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query."

So, after getting the location of British Museum via Search_Hotel_Destination, we can get its latitude and longitude, then use Get_Nearby_Cities with those coordinates to find nearby cities.

But the user wants nearby cities around the hotel, not the British Museum. However, if the hotel is near the British Museum, then the coordinates would be similar. But if the hotel search fails (no beachfront), maybe the assistant has to proceed with the British Museum's coordinates.

But the user's main request is to find a hotel near British Museum that's beachfront, then nearby cities around that hotel.

So first, need to find the hotel. Let's outline the tool calls:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London" to get dest_id, latitude, longitude.

2. Then, call Get_Filter with the dest_id, arrival_date 2024-12-01, departure_date 2024-12-06, to get possible categories_filter. Maybe beachfront is an option.

3. Then, call Search_Hotels with dest_id, dates, and categories_filter set to beachfront (if available).

But if beachfront isn't a valid category in London, the Search_Hotels might not return results. However, the assistant has to make the calls as per the user's request.

After that, once a hotel is found (assuming coordinates are available from Search_Hotels response), call Get_Nearby_Cities with the hotel's latitude and longitude.

But the tools don't specify that Search_Hotels returns coordinates. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination returns latitude and longitude for the search query (the destination), not the individual hotels. So perhaps the hotel's location coordinates would be part of the Search_Hotels response, but the tool description doesn't mention it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Get_Nearby_Cities uses the coordinates from the destination (British Museum), but the user wants nearby cities around the hotel. If the hotel is near the British Museum, then the coordinates would be similar.

But given the tools, perhaps the process is:

- Use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the coordinates of "British Museum, London".

- Then, use Get_Nearby_Cities with those coordinates to find nearby cities.

But the user said "nearby cities around hotel", so ideally, the hotel's coordinates. But if we can't get the hotel's coordinates without first finding the hotel, which requires the Search_Hotels call.

Wait, but the user is asking for a beachfront hotel near the British Museum. Since London isn't coastal, this might not exist, but the assistant has to proceed.

So first tool call: Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London".

Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the dates, and try to apply a beachfront filter. To get the correct categories_filter, maybe need to call Get_Filter first.

Wait, the Get_Filter function is used to get the categories_filter parameter for Search_Hotels. So:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination("British Museum, London") → get dest_id.

2. Get_Filter with search_type (from Search_Hotel_Destination response?), dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date.

But the Get_Filter requires search_type, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination's response. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it returns latitude and longitude, but maybe also search_type? The parameters for Search_Hotels include search_type which is retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination.

Looking back: In Search_Hotels parameters, search_type is "retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination endpoint".

So, the Search_Hotel_Destination response probably includes search_type and dest_id.

Therefore, step 1: Call Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London" to get dest_id and search_type.

Then, step 2: Call Get_Filter with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date to get possible categories_filter, including beachfront.

But the user wants beachfront, so check if that's in the categories_filter options.

Then, step 3: Call Search_Hotels with dest_id, search_type, dates, and categories_filter set to beachfront.

Assuming that beachfront is a valid category (even though in London it's unlikely), proceed.

Then, once a hotel is found (though maybe none), get its coordinates. But how? The Search_Hotels response might include hotel locations, but the tool description doesn't specify. Alternatively, the Search_Hotel_Destination gives the area's coordinates, which would be the same as the British Museum's.

But the user wants nearby cities around the hotel, so ideally the hotel's coordinates. If the hotel is near the British Museum, then using the British Museum's coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination would be sufficient for Get_Nearby_Cities.

So, after getting the latitude and longitude from Search_Hotel_Destination, call Get_Nearby_Cities with those coordinates.

But the user specified "around hotel", but if the hotel is in the same area as the British Museum, then the coordinates are the same.

So the plan is:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination("British Museum, London") → get lat, long, dest_id, search_type.

2. Get_Filter with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date to find categories_filter for beachfront.

3. Search_Hotels with dest
