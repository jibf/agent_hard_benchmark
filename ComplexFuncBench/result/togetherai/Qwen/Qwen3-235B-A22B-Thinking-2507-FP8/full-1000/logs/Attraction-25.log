2025-08-13 22:04:23,283 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about Westminster Abbey after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Westminster Abbey" as the query. That gave me a product ID and slug. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug to get more specifics.

Now, looking at the response from Get_Attraction_Details, there's a lot of info here. The description mentions it's a Medieval gothic 'royal peculiar' with coronations and royal weddings. It lists notable people buried there like Chaucer, Newton, Darwin. Also, details about the tour: includes a private guide, tickets, and entry. The cancellation policy is free, which is good. The price is $565.39 USD. There are accessibility notes like wheelchair access but not recommended for people with spinal injuries or poor cardiovascular health.

The user probably wants a concise summary highlighting key points: historical significance, what the tour includes, price, accessibility, and any important notes. They might be considering booking, so mentioning the free cancellation and what's included (like the guide and tickets) is important. Also, noting the physical requirements since it's not suitable for everyone. Should structure the answer to cover these aspects clearly without too much jargon. Make sure to present the info in a friendly, helpful way since they're excited about it from social media.
