Okay, let's see. The user wants to travel from San Francisco to Tokyo on December 1, 2024, returning on December 8. They need the cheapest tickets around those dates, plus detailed flight info and a seat map.

First, I need to figure out the steps. To get flight options, I should start by searching for flights. But to do that, I need the location IDs for San Francisco and Tokyo airports. The user didn't provide those, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location function to find the correct IDs.

So, first call Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get the fromId. Then another call for "Tokyo" to get the toId. Once I have those IDs, I can use Search_Flights with the dates, cabin class (maybe economy since they want cheapest), and sort by CHEAPEST. Wait, the Search_Flights function has a sort parameter that can be CHEAPEST. But the user also mentioned "around those dates," so maybe Get_Min_Price is better because it checks 5 days before and after. Wait, the user said "cheapest air tickets around those dates," so Get_Min_Price might be the right function here. Let me check the tool descriptions.

Get_Min_Price: "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." So if the user is flexible, this would give the min price around the dates. But the user specified December 1 and 8, but maybe they want the cheapest within a few days of those dates. However, the user said "around those dates," so Get_Min_Price is appropriate here.

Wait, but the user also wants detailed flight info and seat map. So first, need to get the flight options, then for the selected flight, get details and seat map.

Wait, the process would be:

1. Get location IDs for San Francisco and Tokyo using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price with fromId, toId, departDate (Dec 1), returnDate (Dec 8), cabinClass maybe ECONOMY (since cheapest), to find the minimum price flights around those dates.
3. But Get_Min_Price returns the lowest priced flights, but maybe we need to first get the actual flight options. Wait, maybe Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST would give the cheapest flights on the exact dates, but the user said "around those dates," so Get_Min_Price is better.

Wait, the user says "cheapest air tickets around those dates," so Get_Min_Price is the right tool here. Let me check the parameters for Get_Min_Price: requires fromId, toId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional? Wait, looking at the required parameters: ["fromId", "toId", "departDate"]. So returnDate is not required, but the user has a return date. Wait, the user is doing a round trip, so returnDate is needed. Wait, the Get_Min_Price parameters include returnDate as optional? Let me check.

Looking at Get_Min_Price parameters:

"required": ["fromId", "toId", "departDate"]

So returnDate is not required. But the user is returning on Dec 8, so maybe it's a round trip. Wait, the Get_Min_Price description says it's for the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. But if it's a round trip, does it handle return dates? The parameters include returnDate, so probably yes. So for a round trip, we need to include returnDate.

Wait, the user is traveling from SF to Tokyo on Dec 1 and returning on Dec 8. So it's a round trip. So Get_Min_Price should have departDate as Dec 1 and returnDate as Dec 8. But the required parameters for Get_Min_Price are fromId, toId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional. Hmm. Maybe for round trips, returnDate is needed. Let me check the description again.

The Get_Min_Price description says: "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." It might be for one-way, but the parameters include returnDate. Maybe it's for round trips as well. So to get the min price for a round trip, we need to provide returnDate.

But since the required parameters don't include returnDate, maybe it's optional. However, the user has a return date, so we should include it.

So steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for "San Francisco" to get fromId.
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for "Tokyo" to get toId.
3. Call Get_Min_Price with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-01, returnDate=2024-12-08, cabinClass=ECONOMY (since cheapest), to get the minimum price flights around those dates.
4. From the Get_Min_Price response, get the token or offerToken for the cheapest flight.
5. Then use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get detailed info.
6. Also, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken to get the seat map.

Wait, but Get_Min_Price might not return the token. Let me check the tool descriptions.

Get_Min_Price: returns the lowest priced flights, but the parameters don't mention token. The Search_Flights function returns offerToken and token. So perhaps Get_Min_Price is just for price info, not for booking. So maybe the correct approach is:

- Use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST, but since the user wants around the dates, maybe Search_Flights with the exact dates and then check nearby dates? But the user said "around those dates," so Get_Min_Price is designed for that.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user's departDate is Dec 1, it checks Nov 26 to Dec 6, and similarly for returnDate. But the user's return is Dec 8, so maybe Get_Min_Price would adjust the return date as well.

But the problem is, how to get the actual flight details. Because Get_Min_Price might not provide the flight tokens needed for Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map.

Looking at the tools:

- Search_Flights returns offerToken and token.
- Get_Flight_Details requires token from Search_Flights.
- Get_Seat_Map requires offerToken from Search_Flights.

So perhaps the correct flow is:

1. Get location IDs for SF and Tokyo.
2. Use Search_Flights with departDate=2024-12-01, returnDate=2024-12-08, sort=CHEAPEST, to get the cheapest flight on those dates. But the user said "around those dates," so maybe we need to search multiple dates. However, the Search_Flights function doesn't have a parameter for date flexibility. So maybe Get_Min_Price is the way to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights for those specific dates.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price function's response probably includes the best dates and prices, but to get the actual flight details, we need to call Search_Flights for those specific dates.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's outline the steps as per the tools available.

First, the user needs location IDs. So first two tool calls: Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco and Tokyo.

Once we have fromId and toId, we can call Get_Min_Price with departDate=2024-12-01, returnDate=2024-12-08. But Get_Min_Price's required parameters are fromId, toId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional. However, since it's a round trip, including returnDate makes sense.

Assuming Get_Min_Price returns the minimum price and possibly the best dates, but we need to get the actual flight options. Wait, maybe Get_Min_Price returns the cheapest price and the dates, but to get the flight details, we need to call Search_Flights for those dates.

Alternatively, maybe Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST and the given dates will give the cheapest flight on those dates, but the user wants around the dates, so perhaps we need to check multiple dates. But the tools don't have a way to search a date range except through Get_Min_Price.

Hmm. The user said "cheapest air tickets around those dates", so the Get_Min_Price function is designed for exactly that. So first, call Get_Min_Price to find the cheapest dates around Dec 1 and Dec 8.

But Get_Min_Price requires departDate and optionally returnDate. So we'll provide departDate=2024-12-01 and returnDate=2024-12-08.

Once we get the min price info, which might include the actual best dates, but how do we get the flight tokens? Maybe Get_Min_Price doesn't provide tokens, so we need to then call Search_Flights for the specific dates that are cheapest.

Wait, perhaps the Get_Min_Price response includes the offerToken or token, but according to the tool description, it's not specified. The tool description for Get_Min_Price says it returns the lowest priced flights, but the parameters don't mention tokens. So likely, it's just price info, not booking tokens.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

1. Get fromId and toId via Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price to find the cheapest dates around Dec 1 and Dec 8.
3. Use the dates from Get_Min_Price to call Search_Flights with those specific dates, sort=CHEAPEST, to get the flight tokens.
4. Then use Get_Flight_Details and Get
