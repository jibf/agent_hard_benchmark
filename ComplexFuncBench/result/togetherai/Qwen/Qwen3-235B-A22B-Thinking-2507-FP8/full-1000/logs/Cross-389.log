2025-08-13 21:04:07,484 - evaluation_logger_Cross-389 - INFO - Query: I'm going to have a meeting at the Madison Square Garden in New York on November 18, 2024. After the meeting ends at 1 PM, I will fly from New York to Los Angeles for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Los Angeles after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 50 kilometers of the airport in Los Angeles and check what fun places there are around the hotel.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they have a meeting at Madison Square Garden in New York on November 18, 2024, ending at 1 PM. They need the earliest flight to Los Angeles after that time. Then, a taxi to the airport right after the meeting. Also, find a hotel within 50 km of the LA airport and check nearby attractions.

Starting with the flight. To search for flights, I need the departure and arrival airport IDs. The user is flying from New York to Los Angeles. But first, I need to get the correct airport codes or location IDs. The function Search_Flight_Location can help find the airports. So, I should call Search_Flight_Location for New York and Los Angeles to get their IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned Madison Square Garden, but that's a venue, not the airport. The departure airport from New York is likely JFK, EWR, or LGA. Similarly, Los Angeles airport is LAX. But the API requires location IDs from the searchDestination endpoint. So first, use Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the correct fromId, and "Los Angeles" for toId.

Next, the departure date is November 18, 2024, but the meeting ends at 1 PM, so the flight should be after that. The departDate parameter is the date, but the time isn't specified in the function. Wait, the Search_Flights function's parameters include departDate as YYYY-MM-DD, but no time. However, the user wants the earliest flight after 1 PM. Maybe the API handles time through the sort parameter? The sort can be BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST. But to get the earliest after 1 PM, perhaps we need to set departDate as 2024-11-18 and sort by FASTEST or maybe the API returns flights for the day, and we can filter the earliest after 13:00. But the function parameters don't have a time field, only date. Hmm, maybe the API's response includes flight times, and the user will have to check, but the function call just needs the date. So departDate is 2024-11-18, and we sort by FASTEST to get the earliest possible flight after 1 PM.

Wait, the user says "earliest flight to Los Angeles after the meeting", which ends at 1 PM. So the flight departure time should be after 13:00 on Nov 18. But the Search_Flights function's parameters don't include time, only date. So maybe the API returns all flights for that date, and the client (us) has to pick the earliest after 1 PM. But since we can't do that in the function call, perhaps the sort=FASTEST would prioritize the earliest flights. So we'll set sort=FASTEST.

Next, the taxi. To call a taxi, need pick-up and drop-off place IDs. The pick-up is Madison Square Garden, drop-off is the airport (JFK, EWR, or LGA). So first, need to get the googlePlaceId for Madison Square Garden and the airport. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Madison Square Garden, New York" to get its place ID, and for the airport (once we know which one from the flight search), but wait, the flight search hasn't been done yet. Wait, but the user wants the taxi to take them to the airport right after the meeting, so the drop-off for the taxi is the departure airport. But which airport? The flight search will determine which airport they're flying from, but maybe the user is departing from the closest one to Madison Square Garden, which is probably LGA or JFK. However, without knowing the exact airport from the flight search, maybe we need to first get the flight, then get the airport, then the taxi. But the user is asking to call the taxi after the meeting, so the taxi's drop-off is the airport used for the flight.

This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. Maybe the process is: first, find the flight, which will have a departure airport (fromId), then use that airport's location to get the taxi drop-off place ID. But to get the flight, we need the fromId, which requires searching for New York airports. Let's proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get possible airports. Then, use the most relevant one (maybe the main one, like JFK) as fromId. Similarly for Los Angeles, get LAX as toId.

Wait, the user's flight is from New York to Los Angeles, so fromId should be the New York airport's ID, toId the LA airport's ID.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get fromId.

Second tool call: Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get toId.

Once we have those IDs, call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-18, sort=FASTEST (to get earliest flight after 1 PM).

Then, for the taxi, need pick-up at Madison Square Garden. So call Taxi_Search_Location with query "Madison Square Garden" to get its googlePlaceId. The drop-off is the departure airport (from the flight's fromId, which corresponds to an airport like JFK). But to get the airport's googlePlaceId, maybe we need to use Taxi_Search_Location for the airport name, e.g., "John F. Kennedy International Airport".

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location gives the airport's ID for the flight search, but for the taxi, we need the googlePlaceId. So perhaps after getting the flight's departure airport name (from the Search_Flight_Location response), we can use Taxi_Search_Location to get its googlePlaceId.

But let's outline the steps:

1. Find New York airports via Search_Flight_Location("New York") → get fromId (e.g., JFK's ID)
2. Find Los Angeles airports via Search_Flight_Location("Los Angeles") → get toId (e.g., LAX's ID)
3. Search flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-18, sort=FASTEST
4. From the flight result, get the departure airport name (e.g., JFK)
5. Search taxi locations for Madison Square Garden (pick-up) and JFK airport (drop-off)
6. Call Search_Taxi with those place IDs, pick-up time after 1 PM (say 1:30 PM to allow time to get to airport)
7. Then, for the hotel in LA: need to find hotels near LAX within 50 km. But first, get LAX's coordinates. How? Maybe via Search_Hotel_Destination for "Los Angeles" to get latitude and longitude, then use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coords, radius 50 km.
8. Then, for the hotel found, get its ID and call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By.

Wait, the user said "within 50 kilometers of the airport in Los Angeles". So the airport is LAX. To get LAX's coordinates, perhaps use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Los Angeles" but that might give the city center. Alternatively, maybe the airport's coordinates can be found via another method. Alternatively, use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Los Angeles International Airport" to get its latitude and longitude.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function is for finding hotels by location, but it returns latitude and longitude for the search query. So if we query "Los Angeles International Airport", it should return the coordinates of LAX.

So steps for hotel:

a. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Los Angeles International Airport" to get lat and long.
b. Then call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, radius 50 (since user said 50 km), arrival_date and departure_date (but user didn't specify dates for hotel, but the flight is on Nov 18, so hotel check-in would be same day? Maybe assume arrival_date=2024-11-18, departure_date=2024-11-19 or something. But user didn't specify, so maybe use the flight date as arrival, and next day as departure. But the user says "after the meeting" they fly to LA for vacation, so hotel stay starts on Nov 18. So arrival_date=2024-11-18, departure_date=2024-11-19 (at least one night).

But the user didn't specify hotel dates, so perhaps we have to assume arrival_date is the same as flight date, and departure_date is a day after. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the function requires those dates, so we'll have to set them as 2024-11-18 and 2024-11-19.

Then, once a hotel is found, get its ID and call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By.

So compiling all the tool calls needed:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get fromId
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Los Angeles" to get toId
3. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-18, sort=FASTEST
4. Taxi_Search_Location for "Madison Square Garden" to get pick_up_place_id
5. Taxi_Search_Location for the departure airport (e.g., "John
