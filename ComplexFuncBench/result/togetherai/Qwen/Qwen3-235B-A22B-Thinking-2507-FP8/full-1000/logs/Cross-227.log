I need to book the cheapest flights for this multi-stop trip. I plan to stay at the Hotel Boss, Singapore in Singapore, can you check whether the hotel is available on those dates? Don't forget to arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Singapore airport on the 22nd.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on November 20, 2024, then from Singapore to Nagoya on November 22. They want the cheapest flights. Then, they need to check if Hotel Boss in Singapore is available for those dates. Also, arrange a taxi pickup from the hotel three hours before the flight on the 22nd to the Singapore airport.

First, I need to handle the flight search. The user mentioned multi-stop, so I should use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. But to do that, I need the airport IDs for Hong Kong, Singapore, and Nagoya. The function requires fromId and toId as location IDs from the Search_Flight_Location endpoint. So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs.

Wait, the user said Hong Kong to Singapore, then Singapore to Nagoya. So legs would be [HK to SG, SG to Nagoya]. So first, I need to get the correct airport codes. Let me check: Hong Kong International Airport is HKG, Singapore Changi is SIN, Nagoya Centrair is NGO. But the function uses IDs like BOM.AIRPORT, so maybe the IDs are in that format. So I need to call Search_Flight_Location with "Hong Kong", "Singapore", "Nagoya" to get their respective IDs.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location for Hong Kong. Then Singapore, then Nagoya. Wait, but the user might have specific airports, but probably the main ones. Let's do that.

Next, after getting the IDs, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: [fromId: HK's ID, toId: SG's ID, date: 2024-11-20], then [fromId: SG's ID, toId: Nagoya's ID, date: 2024-11-22]. Sort by CHEAPEST.

Then, check Hotel Boss availability. Need hotel_id for Hotel Boss in Singapore. So first, use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the location ID for Singapore, but maybe better to use Search_Hotels with the hotel name. Wait, the Get_Room_List_With_Availability requires hotel_id, which comes from Search_Hotels or Search_HotelsByCoordinates. So first, need to find the hotel_id for Hotel Boss, Singapore. So call Search_Hotels with query for Hotel Boss in Singapore. But the parameters for Search_Hotels require dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. Hmm, maybe first use Search_Hotel_Destination with "Singapore" to get the dest_id, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and maybe the hotel name. Wait, the Search_Hotels function has parameters like search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date. But the user wants to check availability for the dates they're staying. They arrive in Singapore on Nov 20, leave on Nov 22. So arrival_date is 2024-11-20, departure_date is 2024-11-22. But to get the hotel_id, maybe first search for Hotel Boss in Singapore. So perhaps use Search_Hotels with dest_id for Singapore, arrival and departure dates, and maybe filter by hotel name. But the Search_Hotels function doesn't have a name parameter. Wait, looking at the parameters for Search_Hotels: it has search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc., but not hotel name. So maybe the way to find Hotel Boss is to first get the dest_id for Singapore via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and dates, then look for Hotel Boss in the results to get its hotel_id. But since the user specifically mentions "Hotel Boss, Singapore", perhaps the Search_Hotels function can be used with the dest_id for Singapore and then filter the results, but the function parameters don't include a name filter. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the Search_Hotels function's description says it's to search hotels, so maybe the hotel name is part of the search, but the parameters don't list a name field. Let me check the parameters again.

Looking at Search_Hotels parameters: it has sort_by, search_type, categories_filter, price_min, price_max, children_age, adults, arrival_date, room_qty, dest_id, departure_date. No hotel name parameter. So perhaps the dest_id is for the location, and the actual hotel name isn't a parameter. So maybe the user needs to first get the dest_id for Singapore via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and dates, then in the response, find Hotel Boss to get its hotel_id. But since we can't do that in the tool call, perhaps the assistant needs to first call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Singapore" to get the dest_id, then call Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22, and then from the results, pick Hotel Boss's hotel_id. But since the tool calls are sequential, the first step is to get the dest_id for Singapore.

Wait, the user says "Hotel Boss, Singapore", so maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Hotel Boss, Singapore" would give the correct location? Or maybe Search_Hotels requires dest_id which is obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination for the city. Let's proceed step by step.

First, for the flights:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Hong Kong" to get fromId for first leg.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Singapore" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.
3. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Nagoya" to get toId for second leg.
4. Then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs and sort by CHEAPEST.

For the hotel:

5. Call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Singapore" to get dest_id.
6. Use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with arrival_date 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22 to find Hotel Boss and get its hotel_id.
7. Then call Get_Room_List_With_Availability with hotel_id, arrival_date, departure_date.

For the taxi:

8. Need to arrange taxi from Hotel Boss to Singapore airport on 22nd, three hours before flight. So first, need the flight time from the multi-stop search result. But since the user hasn't provided flight times yet, maybe the taxi pickup time depends on the flight departure time. However, the user says "three hours before my flight", so once the flight is booked, we can get the departure time, subtract three hours for pickup time. But since we're in the planning phase, perhaps the taxi search needs the pickup time. Wait, the user says "arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Singapore airport on the 22nd." So the flight from Singapore to Nagoya is on 22nd, so the taxi is on 22nd, pickup time is flight departure time minus 3 hours.

But to get the flight departure time, we need the flight search result. However, the user is asking to book the cheapest flights, so the exact time might not be known yet. But the taxi search requires pick_up_time and pick_up_date. The date is 2024-11-22, but the time depends on the flight. Since the user wants the cheapest flights, which might have specific departure times, but we don't have that info yet. So perhaps the taxi arrangement can't be done until after the flight is booked. But the user is asking to arrange it now, so maybe we need to proceed step by step: first get the flight info, then use that to determine the taxi time.

But in the current step, the user is asking to check hotel availability and arrange taxi, so perhaps the assistant needs to first get the flight details (to know the departure time from Singapore), then set the taxi time accordingly. However, since the flight search is part of the process, maybe the taxi arrangement is dependent on the flight result. But the user's instruction is to "arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight", so the assistant needs to, after finding the flight, calculate the pickup time.

But in the tool calls, for the taxi, we need pick_up_place_id (hotel's googlePlaceId) and drop_off_place_id (airport's googlePlaceId). So first, need to get the googlePlaceId for Hotel Boss and for Singapore airport.

So steps for taxi:

- Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Hotel Boss, Singapore" to get pick_up_place_id.
- Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Singapore Changi Airport" to get drop_off_place_id.
- Then, once flight departure time is known (from flight search result), set pick_up_time as departure_time - 3 hours.

But since the flight search hasn't been done yet, the departure time isn't known. However, the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, so perhaps the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then the taxi. But in the current query, the user is asking to do all these steps, so the assistant needs to make the necessary tool calls in order.

Putting it all together, the first step is to resolve the flight locations (get airport IDs),
