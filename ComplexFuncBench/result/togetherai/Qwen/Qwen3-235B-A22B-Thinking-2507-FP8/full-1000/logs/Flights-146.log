Okay, let's see. The user wants to travel from Seattle to Amsterdam on December 5, 2024, returning on December 12. They need the cheapest tickets around those dates, plus detailed flight info and a seat map.

First, I need to figure out the correct functions to use. The user mentioned "cheapest air tickets," so I should start by searching for flights. But to do that, I need the location IDs for Seattle and Amsterdam. The Search_Flight_Location function can get those IDs based on the city names.

So step 1: Use Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle" and "Amsterdam" to get fromId and toId. Wait, but the user is going from Seattle to Amsterdam, so fromId is Seattle's ID and toId is Amsterdam's. But maybe I need to call Search_Flight_Location twice, once for each city.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location function takes a query parameter. So first, call it with "Seattle" to get the correct airport ID, then with "Amsterdam" for the destination.

Once I have the IDs, I can use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST, departDate=2024-12-05, returnDate=2024-12-12, fromId, toId. That should give the cheapest flights.

But the user also wants detailed flight info and a seat map. For detailed info, Get_Flight_Details requires a token from the Search_Flights response. Similarly, Get_Seat_Map needs an offerToken from Search_Flights.

So the steps are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Seattle to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Amsterdam to get toId.
3. Use Search_Flights with the obtained IDs, dates, sort=CHEAPEST.
4. From the Search_Flights response, take a token and offerToken to call Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map.

Wait, but the user said "around those dates," so maybe the Get_Min_Price function is relevant? The description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. But the user specified exact dates but wants the cheapest around those dates. Hmm. The user said "around those dates," so maybe Get_Min_Price is better here. Let me check the function descriptions.

Get_Min_Price: "return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." So if the user's dates are Dec 5 and 12, this function would check from Dec 0 to Dec 10 for departure and return dates within that window. But the user might want the exact dates but the cheapest options near them. However, the user said "around those dates," so maybe Get_Min_Price is the right choice here.

Wait, the user says: "find the cheapest air tickets around those dates". So Get_Min_Price is designed for that. Let me check the parameters. It requires fromId, toId, departDate. Optional returnDate. Since it's a round trip, returnDate is needed. So maybe call Get_Min_Price with departDate=2024-12-05, returnDate=2024-12-12.

But first, need the fromId and toId. So first, use Search_Flight_Location for Seattle and Amsterdam to get the IDs.

So the plan is:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with "Seattle" to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with "Amsterdam" to get toId.
3. Call Get_Min_Price with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-05, returnDate=2024-12-12, cabinClass maybe default to ECONOMY unless specified. The user didn't specify cabin class, so maybe assume ECONOMY.

Wait, the user didn't mention cabin class, so perhaps the default is ECONOMY. The Get_Min_Price function's parameters include cabinClass as optional, but the required are fromId, toId, departDate. So maybe call it without cabinClass, but the API might default to ECONOMY.

But the user says "cheapest", which is likely economy. So maybe include cabinClass=ECONOMY.

Once Get_Min_Price returns the minimum price, but the user also wants detailed flight info and seat map. However, Get_Min_Price might not return tokens needed for Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map. Let me check the function descriptions.

Get_Min_Price's description says it returns the lowest priced flights. But the other functions like Search_Flights return tokens. Maybe Get_Min_Price is just for price, but to get details, need to use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST.

Wait, the user wants the cheapest tickets, so perhaps Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST is better because it returns flight details which include tokens for further info.

So maybe the correct approach is:

1. Get location IDs for Seattle and Amsterdam via Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST, departDate=2024-12-05, returnDate=2024-12-12, fromId, toId.
3. From the Search_Flights response, take a token to call Get_Flight_Details and an offerToken for Get_Seat_Map.

But the user said "around those dates", so maybe Search_Flights allows for date flexibility? Wait, the Search_Flights parameters don't mention date flexibility, but the Get_Min_Price does (5 days before/after). Hmm.

Wait, the user's exact request is "cheapest air tickets around those dates". So "around" implies looking a few days before and after. The Get_Min_Price function is specifically designed for that: "lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date". So that's the right function for finding the cheapest around the dates.

But then, how to get the detailed info and seat map? Because Get_Min_Price might not return the necessary tokens. Let me check the function descriptions again.

Get_Min_Price: returns minimum price, but perhaps the response includes flight details with tokens? The description isn't clear. The other functions like Search_Flights return tokens. Maybe after getting the min price, you still need to do a Search_Flights with the specific dates to get the tokens.

Alternatively, maybe the Get_Min_Price is just for price info, and to get the actual flights with tokens, you need to use Search_Flights with the dates and sort by cheapest.

This is a bit confusing. Let's re-read the function descriptions.

Get_Min_Price: "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date."

Search_Flights: "Search Flights. EndPoint: /api/v1/flights/searchFlights" with parameters including sort (BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST).

So if the user wants the cheapest around the dates, using Get_Min_Price would give the min price over the date range, but to get the actual flight details (which include tokens for seat map and details), we need to use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST and perhaps the date range.

Wait, but Search_Flights parameters don't have a date range; they take specific departDate and returnDate. However, the user said "around those dates", so maybe the assistant should adjust the dates to search within a window. But the functions don't support that directly except for Get_Min_Price.

Hmm. The user's query says "around those dates", so the correct function is Get_Min_Price. But then, how to get the detailed flight info and seat map? Because Get_Min_Price might not provide the tokens needed for Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map.

Alternatively, maybe after getting the min price, you can use the specific date that has the min price and then call Search_Flights for that exact date to get the tokens.

But the problem is that the assistant has to make the function calls step by step. So first, get the location IDs, then get the min price, which might return the best date and price, then use that date to search flights for details.

But the user wants the detailed info for the cheapest tickets around the dates, so perhaps:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Seattle and Amsterdam to get IDs.
2. Call Get_Min_Price with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-05, returnDate=2024-12-12. This will give the min price and possibly the actual flight dates that are cheapest.
3. Then, use those specific dates (which might be different from the user's requested dates) to call Search_Flights to get the flight details with tokens.
4. Then use the tokens from Search_Flights to get Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might expect the flights around Dec 5 and 12, so the min price function would adjust the dates within 5 days. However, the user's return date is Dec 12, so the returnDate in Get_Min_Price is required? Wait, the required parameters for Get_Min_Price are fromId, toId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional. But since it's a round trip, returnDate is needed. Wait, looking back:

Get_Min_Price parameters: required are ["fromId", "toId", "departDate"]. ReturnDate is not required. But for a round trip, you need returnDate. Wait, the description says "lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." So maybe for round trip, it's departDate and returnDate both with 5-day windows.

Wait, the parameters for Get_Min_Price include returnDate as a string, but it's not in the required list
