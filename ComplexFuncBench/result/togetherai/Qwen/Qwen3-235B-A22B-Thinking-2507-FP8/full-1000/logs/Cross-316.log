I want to take a taxi from 930 St Mary's Rd to University of Manitoba in 20 minutes to see my friend. We'll have lunch at the school first. At 5 PM, we’ll take a taxi to a shopping mall in a nearby city around University of Manitoba for some shopping. Arrange the taxis for both trips.

Okay, let's see. The user wants to arrange two taxi trips. First, they need a taxi from 930 St Mary's Rd to the University of Manitoba in 20 minutes. It's currently 8 AM on December 25th, 2024. Then, at 5 PM, they'll take another taxi to a shopping mall in a nearby city around the university.

First, I need to handle the first taxi ride. The pickup location is 930 St Mary's Rd, and the drop-off is University of Manitoba. But the taxi search functions require Google Place IDs for both locations. So I need to get those Place IDs using the Taxi_Search_Location function.

Wait, the user mentioned "930 St Mary's Rd" and "University of Manitoba". I should call Taxi_Search_Location for each of these addresses to get their Google Place IDs. Let me check the parameters for Taxi_Search_Location: it takes a query string. So first, I'll search for "930 St Mary's Rd" and then "University of Manitoba".

Once I have the Place IDs, I can use Search_Taxi for the first trip. The pickup time is 20 minutes from 8 AM, so 8:20 AM. The date is December 25th, 2024, which is YYYY-MM-DD format: 2024-12-25.

Then, for the second trip at 5 PM, they want to go to a shopping mall in a nearby city around the university. Hmm, the nearby city part. The user mentioned "around University of Manitoba", so maybe I need to find nearby cities first. Wait, there's a Get_Nearby_Cities function that requires latitude and longitude. But to get those, I might need to use the Location to Lat Long endpoint from the Meta collection. However, the tools provided don't include that endpoint. Wait, the Get_Nearby_Cities function's parameters say longitude and latitude can be retrieved from api/v1/meta/locationToLatLong, but that function isn't listed in the tools. Wait, looking back at the tools provided:

The tools given are Get_Packages, Search_Taxi, Taxi_Search_Location, Get_Min_Price, Get_Nearby_Cities. The Get_Nearby_Cities requires longitude and latitude, which are supposed to be retrieved from api/v1/meta/locationToLatLong, but that endpoint isn't available as a tool here. So maybe the user expects me to assume that we can get the coordinates somehow, but since it's not a tool, perhaps the University of Manitoba's coordinates are known or can be found via another method.

Wait, but the user is asking to arrange the taxis, so for the second trip, the drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. But to get the nearby cities, I need the coordinates of the University of Manitoba. Since the Get_Nearby_Cities function requires latitude and longitude, but we don't have a tool to get those coordinates. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Manitoba" would return the Place ID, which might include coordinates? But the Taxi_Search_Location function's description says it returns googlePlaceId, not coordinates. So perhaps the coordinates are part of the Place ID data, but the tool doesn't provide that. Wait, the Get_Nearby_Cities function's parameters require longitude and latitude, which are supposed to be retrieved from the meta endpoint, but since that's not a tool here, maybe we can't get them. So perhaps the user expects that for the second part, we first need to get the coordinates of the University of Manitoba to find nearby cities, but without the meta tool, we can't. Wait, but maybe the Taxi_Search_Location for University of Manitoba gives a Place ID, and perhaps the Place ID can be used to get coordinates via another service, but since it's not in the tools, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed by first getting the Place ID for University of Manitoba, then somehow infer coordinates? But the tools don't have a way to get coordinates from Place ID.

Wait, the problem says "Arrange the taxis for both trips." So for the second trip, the user wants to go to a shopping mall in a nearby city around University of Manitoba. So first, we need to find nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities, but that requires latitude and longitude. To get those, we need to use the meta endpoint, but it's not available as a tool. However, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location for University of Manitoba returns a Place ID, and perhaps the Place ID can be used to get coordinates through another method, but since the tools don't include that, maybe the assistant is supposed to assume that the coordinates are known or can be derived.

Alternatively, maybe the University of Manitoba's coordinates are standard. For example, University of Manitoba is in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Its coordinates are approximately 49.8091° N, 97.1580° W. But the user might expect the system to look it up. However, since the tools don't have a way to get coordinates, perhaps the assistant should first call Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Manitoba" to get its Place ID, but that doesn't give coordinates. Wait, the Get_Nearby_Cities function requires longitude and latitude, which are strings. Maybe the assistant is supposed to use the Taxi_Search_Location to get the Place ID, and then somehow extract coordinates from that, but the tool response isn't specified here. Since the problem is about arranging the taxis, perhaps for the second trip, the assistant needs to first find nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities, but without coordinates, it's stuck.

Wait, maybe the user expects that for the second trip, after getting the nearby cities, we can then search for a shopping mall in one of those cities. But to get nearby cities, we need coordinates of the University of Manitoba. Since the tools don't have a way to get coordinates, perhaps the assistant should first call Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Manitoba" to get its Place ID, and then maybe the Place ID can be used with another service to get coordinates, but since that's not a tool, maybe the problem expects us to proceed by assuming that the coordinates are known or that the Get_Nearby_Cities can be called with some placeholder values. But that's not realistic.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant is supposed to handle the first taxi trip first, and for the second trip, since it's to a nearby city, perhaps the user expects to first get the nearby cities around the University of Manitoba, which requires coordinates, but since we can't get coordinates, maybe the assistant should call Get_Nearby_Cities with some assumed coordinates. But the problem states that the parameters for Get_Nearby_Cities are required, so we need to provide longitude and latitude.

Wait, perhaps the Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Manitoba" returns a Place ID, and the Place ID might be associated with coordinates in the backend, but since the tool response isn't specified, the assistant can't know. Given the tools provided, the only way is to first get the Place ID for University of Manitoba via Taxi_Search_Location, then perhaps use that to get coordinates, but since there's no tool for that, maybe the problem expects that the assistant will call Get_Nearby_Cities with the coordinates obtained from another source, but since it's not available, perhaps the assistant should proceed by first getting the Place ID for University of Manitoba, then somehow proceed.

Wait, maybe the assistant is supposed to realize that for the second trip, they need to find a nearby city, so first call Get_Nearby_Cities with the coordinates of the University of Manitoba. But to get those coordinates, they need to use the meta endpoint, which isn't a tool here. However, the problem says "Arrange the taxis for both trips," so perhaps the assistant should first handle the first taxi trip, then for the second, assume that the nearby city's location can be found via Get_Nearby_Cities, but without coordinates, it's impossible. Therefore, maybe the assistant should first call Taxi_Search_Location for University of Manitoba to get its Place ID, and then perhaps the Place ID can be used to get coordinates through another method, but since it's not a tool, maybe the problem expects the assistant to proceed by making an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should first get the Place IDs for both locations for the first trip, then schedule the first taxi. For the second trip, since it's to a shopping mall in a nearby city, the assistant needs to first find nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities, which requires coordinates. To get coordinates, maybe the assistant should use the Taxi_Search_Location for University of Manitoba, which might return coordinates in the response, but the tool description says it returns googlePlaceId. Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location function's description says: "Find the `googlePlaceId` of Pick-up/Drop-off Location for taxi." So it only returns the Place ID, not coordinates. Therefore, without a way to get coordinates, the Get_Nearby_Cities function can't be called. This is a problem.

Wait, but maybe the University of Manitoba's coordinates are known. For example, if I recall, the University of Manitoba is located at approximately 49.8091° N, 97.1580° W. So latitude 49.8091, longitude -97.1580. But the parameters for Get_Nearby_Cities require strings. So maybe the assistant can use these coordinates. However, the problem states that the longitude and latitude should be retrieved from the meta endpoint, but since it's not available, perhaps the assistant is allowed to use known coordinates.

Given that, the assistant would
