2025-08-13 20:06:24,733 - evaluation_logger_Cross-216 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from Toronto on December 2, 2024, going to Vancouver and Edmonton, then returning to Toronto. I'm expecting to stay in each city for a week. My address is 200 Bloor St W in Toronto. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want the cheapest connecting flight from Toronto on Dec 2, 2024, going to Vancouver and Edmonton, then back to Toronto. They'll stay a week in each city. Also, need taxi bookings to and from the airport.

First, I need to handle the flight search. The user mentioned connecting flights with multiple stops. The endpoint for that is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. But wait, the legs parameter requires fromId, toId, and date for each leg. So the trip is Toronto -> Vancouver -> Edmonton -> Toronto. Wait, the user said "going to Vancouver and Edmonton, then returning to Toronto." So the legs would be Toronto to Vancouver, Vancouver to Edmonton, Edmonton to Toronto? Or maybe Toronto to Vancouver, then Vancouver to Edmonton, then Edmonton back to Toronto? But the user says "returning to Toronto" after Edmonton. So three legs: Toronto (YYZ) to Vancouver (YVR), Vancouver to Edmonton (YEG), then Edmonton back to Toronto. But the user mentioned staying a week in each city. So the dates would be Dec 2 for the first leg, then Dec 9 for the second, Dec 16 for the third.

But first, I need to get the airport IDs for Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton. So I should use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport codes. Let's check the tools available. The Search_Flight_Location function takes a query like city name and returns the airport ID. So for Toronto, query "Toronto" to get YYZ, Vancouver for YVR, Edmonton for YEG.

Wait, the user's address is 200 Bloor St W in Toronto. Maybe that's for the taxi pickup. But first, the flight search. Let me outline the steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get the departure airport ID (probably YYZ).
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver to get YVR.
3. Use Search_Flight_Location for Edmonton to get YEG.
4. Then, structure the legs for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops:
   - Leg 1: Toronto (fromId) to Vancouver (toId), date 2024-12-02
   - Leg 2: Vancouver to Edmonton, date 2024-12-09 (a week later)
   - Leg 3: Edmonton to Toronto, date 2024-12-16 (another week)
5. Set sort to CHEAPEST as per user's request.

But the user said "cheapest connecting flight", so the sort parameter should be CHEAPEST.

Then, for the taxi part: need to book a taxi to the airport three hours before the flight. The flight departure is Dec 2, so the pickup time would be three hours before the flight's departure time. But the user hasn't specified the flight time, so maybe the flight search result will have the departure time. However, since we're in the planning phase, perhaps the taxi pickup time is based on the flight's departure time once the flight is booked. But the user is asking to book the taxi now, so maybe we need to assume a typical flight time or get the flight details first.

Wait, the user is asking to book the taxi three hours before the flight takes off. But without knowing the exact flight time, we can't set the pickup time. So perhaps the flight search needs to be done first to get the departure time, then use that to schedule the taxi.

But the user's request is to "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off". So the process would be:

- First, find the flight details (departure time from Toronto on Dec 2), then calculate pickup time as departure time minus 3 hours.

Similarly, for the return, the taxi pickup from Edmonton airport would be one hour after the flight lands in Toronto.

But since the user hasn't booked the flight yet, we need to first search for flights, then use the flight times to schedule taxis.

However, the user is asking to do both: find the flight and book the taxis. So the assistant needs to first get the flight information, then use that to get the taxi times.

But in the current step, the user is asking for assistance, so the assistant should first call the flight search, then based on the results, call the taxi functions.

But the problem is that the assistant can only make tool calls based on the current query. Since the user hasn't provided flight times, the assistant needs to first search for flights to get the departure and arrival times, then use those to schedule the taxis.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the airport IDs.

Wait, the user's address is 200 Bloor St W in Toronto. For the taxi pickup, we need the googlePlaceId for that address. So use Taxi_Search_Location with query "200 Bloor St W, Toronto" to get the pickup place ID. The drop-off for the first taxi would be the Toronto airport (YYZ), so need its googlePlaceId as well. Wait, Taxi_Search_Location can be used to get the airport's place ID.

Wait, Taxi_Search_Location is for taxi pick-up/drop-off locations. So for the first taxi ride: pickup at 200 Bloor St W, Toronto, drop-off at Toronto airport (YYZ). So need to get the googlePlaceId for both locations.

Similarly, for the return trip: pickup at Edmonton airport, drop-off at 200 Bloor St W.

So steps:

1. For flights:
   a. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get airport ID (e.g., YYZ)
   b. Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver (YVR)
   c. Search_Flight_Location for Edmonton (YEG)
   d. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: Toronto->Vancouver (Dec 2), Vancouver->Edmonton (Dec 9), Edmonton->Toronto (Dec 16), sort by CHEAPEST.

2. For taxis:
   a. Taxi_Search_Location for "200 Bloor St W, Toronto" to get pickup place ID.
   b. Taxi_Search_Location for Toronto airport (using the airport name from step 1a) to get drop-off place ID for the first taxi.
   c. Once flight departure time is known (from flight search result), calculate pickup time as departure time minus 3 hours.
   d. Similarly, for the return flight, get arrival time in Toronto, then taxi pickup time is arrival time plus 1 hour.

But since the user hasn't provided flight times yet, the assistant needs to first get the flight details. However, the user is asking to book the taxis now, which requires the flight times. So the process is sequential: first get flight info, then use that to schedule taxis.

But in the current query, the user is asking to do both, so the assistant should first call the flight search functions, then the taxi search functions once flight times are known.

However, the assistant can only make tool calls based on the current information. Since the flight times aren't known yet, the assistant can't schedule the taxis yet. Therefore, the first step is to gather all necessary location IDs for the flights and taxis.

So the immediate tool calls needed are:

- Search_Flight_Location for Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton to get their airport IDs.
- Taxi_Search_Location for 200 Bloor St W, Toronto and for the airports (to get googlePlaceIds for taxi pickup/drop-off).

Wait, but the Taxi_Search_Location function is for taxi locations, which might use Google Places, so querying the airport name (e.g., "Toronto Pearson Airport") would give the googlePlaceId.

So first, for the flight part:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get the airport ID (like YYZ).

Similarly for Vancouver and Edmonton.

Then, for the taxi part:

Call Taxi_Search_Location with "200 Bloor St W, Toronto" to get the pickup place ID.

Call Taxi_Search_Location with "Toronto Pearson Airport" to get the drop-off place ID for the first taxi.

Same for Edmonton airport for the return trip.

But the user mentioned "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off". So the pickup time depends on the flight's departure time, which we don't have yet. So after getting the flight search results, we can extract the departure time, then calculate the pickup time.

But since the user is asking to book the taxi now, perhaps the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then use that to schedule the taxi.

However, in the current step, the assistant can only make the initial tool calls to gather the necessary location IDs.

So the first set of tool calls should be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto
2. Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver
3. Search_Flight_Location for Edmonton
4. Taxi_Search_Location for "200 Bloor St W, Toronto"
5. Taxi_Search_Location for Toronto airport (once we have the airport name from step 1)
6. Taxi_Search_Location for Edmonton airport (from step 3)

But since the assistant doesn't know the exact airport names yet, maybe step 1-3 will return the airport codes, which can then be used to get the place IDs for taxis.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location returns the airport's ID (like YYZ.AIRPORT), but Taxi_Search_Location uses Google Place IDs. So even if we have the airport code, we need to search for the airport's name in Taxi_Search_Location to get the googlePlaceId.

For example, Toronto's main airport is Pearson (YYZ), so querying "Toronto Pearson Airport" in Taxi_Search_Location would
