2025-08-13 22:35:24,842 - evaluation_logger_Flights-1 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to book flights from Dallas to Prague on November 25th, 2024, then Prague to Vienna on November 29th, and back to Dallas on December 9th. They specified economy class.

First, I need to get the correct airport IDs for each city. The previous tool calls were made for Dallas, Prague, and Vienna. The responses gave me the IDs: DFW.CITY for Dallas, PRG.AIRPORT for Prague, and VIE.AIRPORT for Vienna. Wait, but for Dallas, the ID is DFW.CITY, which is a city code, not an airport. But the flight search requires airport IDs. Hmm, maybe DFW.CITY corresponds to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which is the main airport there. The code is DFW, so maybe the ID should be DFW.AIRPORT? But the response from Search_Flight_Location for Dallas gave DFW.CITY. Let me check the tool response again.

Looking at the tool response for Dallas: [{"id": "DFW.CITY", "type": "CITY", ...}]. So it's a city ID, not an airport. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires fromId and toId as airport location IDs from Search_Flight_Location. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool's description says it finds airports by location, etc., and the response includes the id. But in the Dallas case, it returned a city ID. Maybe the actual airport ID is different. Wait, maybe I need to check if there's an airport associated with Dallas. The main airport is DFW, so perhaps the correct ID is DFW.AIRPORT. But the tool response gave DFW.CITY. Maybe the system uses city codes for the flight search? Or maybe the city ID can be used as the fromId/toId even if it's a city.

Wait, looking at the Prague response: id is PRG.AIRPORT, which makes sense. Similarly, Vienna is VIE.AIRPORT. For Dallas, the tool returned DFW.CITY. Maybe the flight search expects the city code (DFW) as the fromId, even if the type is CITY. Let me check the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. The legs require fromId and toId, which are supposed to be location IDs from Search_Flight_Location. In the example given in the tool's parameters, they used 'BOM.AIRPORT' and 'AMD.AIRPORT', which are airport IDs. So perhaps for Dallas, even though the Search_Flight_Location returned a city ID, the correct fromId should be the airport code. Wait, but the tool response for Dallas didn't give an airport ID, only the city. Maybe I need to do another search for Dallas airports specifically.

Wait, the user said "fly from Dallas", so the departure airport is likely DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport). The Search_Flight_Location with query "Dallas" returned DFW.CITY. Maybe the actual airport ID is DFW.AIRPORT, but the tool didn't return it. Maybe the tool's response for a city query returns the city ID, but to get the airport ID, you need to search for the airport name. Alternatively, perhaps the city ID can be used as the fromId. Let me check the example in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops parameters. The example uses 'BOM.AIRPORT' and 'AMD.AIRPORT', which are airport IDs. So the fromId and toId should be airport IDs, not city IDs.

So for Dallas, the correct airport is DFW, so the ID should be DFW.AIRPORT. But the Search_Flight_Location response for "Dallas" gave DFW.CITY. Maybe I need to adjust the query to get the airport. Wait, perhaps the user should have searched for "Dallas airport" instead of just "Dallas". But the user's initial query was to search for "Dallas", which returned the city. Maybe the system maps city names to the main airport's ID. For example, DFW.CITY might correspond to the DFW airport. Let me check the parameters again.

The Search_Flight_Location tool's description says it finds airports by location, etc. So when you search for "Dallas", it should return the airport(s) in Dallas. But the response was a city object. Maybe the API returns the city as a location, and the actual airport codes are derived from the city code. For example, DFW.CITY's code is DFW, which is the airport code. So perhaps the fromId for Dallas is DFW.AIRPORT, but the tool response didn't give that. Wait, the Prague response had id "PRG.AIRPORT", which matches the airport code PRG. Similarly, Vienna is VIE.AIRPORT. So for Dallas, the airport code is DFW, so the id should be DFW.AIRPORT. But the Search_Flight_Location response for "Dallas" gave DFW.CITY. Maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps the city ID can be used interchangeably. Alternatively, maybe I need to use the city code (DFW) as the fromId, even if the type is CITY.

Looking at the example in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops parameters: fromId is 'BOM.AIRPORT', which is an airport ID. So the correct approach is to have the airport ID. Since the Search_Flight_Location for "Dallas" returned DFW.CITY, but the actual airport is DFW.AIRPORT, perhaps the system expects us to use the city code (DFW) as part of the ID. Maybe the correct fromId is DFW.AIRPORT, but how do I get that? The tool response didn't provide it. Wait, maybe the code field in the Dallas response is "DFW", which is the airport code, so the ID should be DFW.AIRPORT. But the id field in the response is DFW.CITY. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the system allows using the city code as the fromId. For example, using DFW as the fromId. But the example uses BOM.AIRPORT, so it's expecting the full ID. This is a bit confusing. Let's see the Prague response: id is PRG.AIRPORT, code is PRG. So the id is code.AIRPORT. Similarly, Vienna is VIE.AIRPORT. For Dallas, the code is DFW, so the airport id should be DFW.AIRPORT. But the Search_Flight_Location response for "Dallas" gave DFW.CITY. Maybe the correct approach is to use the code (DFW) as the fromId, but formatted as DFW.AIRPORT. However, since the tool response didn't return an airport ID for Dallas, perhaps there's an error, or maybe the city ID can be used.

Wait, maybe when you search for a city name, the API returns the city's main airport's ID. But in the Dallas case, it returned the city ID. Maybe I need to check if there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps the user should have searched for "Dallas airport" to get the airport ID. But given the current responses, I have to work with what's provided.

Given that the user is flying from Dallas, the departure airport is DFW. The Search_Flight_Location response for Dallas has code DFW, so perhaps the fromId should be DFW.AIRPORT. Even though the response says DFW.CITY, maybe the system maps city codes to airport IDs. So I'll proceed with DFW.AIRPORT as the fromId for Dallas.

So the legs would be:

1. From DFW.AIRPORT to PRG.AIRPORT on 2024-11-25
2. From PRG.AIRPORT to VIE.AIRPORT on 2024-11-29
3. From VIE.AIRPORT to DFW.AIRPORT on 2024-12-09

Wait, the user's final leg is back to Dallas on December 9th, so from Vienna to Dallas.

Now, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires the legs as an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date.

So the legs array would be:

[
  {"fromId": "DFW.AIRPORT", "toId": "PRG.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-25"},
  {"fromId": "PRG.AIRPORT", "toId": "VIE.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-29"},
  {"fromId": "VIE.AIRPORT", "toId": "DFW.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-09"}
]

But wait, the user mentioned "fly from Dallas to Prague on November 25th", then "Prague to Vienna on November 29th", then "back to Dallas on December 9th". So three legs: DFW->PRG, PRG->VIE, VIE->DFW.

The cabinClass is economy, so "ECONOMY".

The user is two people, both adults (since they said "my partner and I", assuming both are over 18), so adults=2, children=0.

Now, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops parameters require legs (array), and optionally adults, cabinClass, sort, children.

So the function call should include legs as above, adults=2, cabinClass="ECONOMY".

Wait, the required parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops are legs. The others are optional. So the tool call needs
