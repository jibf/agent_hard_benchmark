2025-08-13 20:05:29,733 - evaluation_logger_Cross-213 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to San Francisco. I'm expecting to stay in each city for ten days. My address is 600 Market St in San Francisco. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want the cheapest connecting flight from San Francisco on Dec 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to SF. They'll stay 10 days in each city. Also, need taxi bookings to/from the airport.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The trip is SF -> San Diego -> Las Vegas -> SF. So three legs. But the user mentioned "connecting flight" which might mean multi-stop. Wait, the return is part of the same trip? Wait, the user says "leaving from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to San Francisco." So the outbound is SF to San Diego to Las Vegas, then return from Las Vegas to SF? Or maybe SF -> San Diego, then San Diego -> Las Vegas, then Las Vegas -> SF. But the user says "returning to San Francisco" so the last leg is back to SF.

Wait, the user says "leaving from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to San Francisco." So the itinerary is:

1. Dec 5: SF -> San Diego

2. Then San Diego -> Las Vegas (after 10 days in San Diego, so Dec 15?)

3. Then Las Vegas -> SF (after 10 days in Las Vegas, so Dec 25?)

But the user says "staying in each city for ten days." So departure from SF on Dec 5, arrive San Diego same day. Stay 10 days, so leave San Diego on Dec 15 to Las Vegas. Stay 10 days there, leave Las Vegas on Dec 25 back to SF.

So the flight legs would be:

Leg 1: SF (SFO) to San Diego (SAN) on Dec 5

Leg 2: San Diego (SAN) to Las Vegas (LAS) on Dec 15

Leg 3: Las Vegas (LAS) to SF (SFO) on Dec 25

But the user mentioned "returning to San Francisco" so the last leg is the return.

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires legs as an array. So need to structure the legs with fromId, toId, date.

First, need to get the airport codes for SF, San Diego, Las Vegas. But the function requires location IDs from the Search_Flight_Location endpoint.

So first step: use Search_Flight_Location to find the correct airport IDs for San Francisco, San Diego, and Las Vegas.

User's address is 600 Market St in SF, but that's for the taxi part.

For the flights:

- From San Francisco (SFO) on Dec 5 to San Diego (SAN)

- Then San Diego (SAN) to Las Vegas (LAS) on Dec 15

- Then Las Vegas (LAS) to San Francisco (SFO) on Dec 25

Wait, but the user said "returning to San Francisco" so the last leg is from Las Vegas to SF.

So legs array would have three entries.

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's legs parameter is an array of legs. Each leg has fromId, toId, date.

So first, need to get the location IDs for SFO, SAN, LAS.

So first call Search_Flight_Location for "San Francisco" to get SFO's ID.

Then "San Diego" for SAN.

Then "Las Vegas" for LAS.

Wait, but the user might have meant the airports, so need to search for the airports.

So first, use Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get the airport ID for SFO.

Similarly for San Diego and Las Vegas.

Once we have the IDs, construct the legs:

Leg 1: fromId (SFO), toId (SAN), date 2024-12-05

Leg 2: fromId (SAN), toId (LAS), date 2024-12-15

Leg 3: fromId (LAS), toId (SFO), date 2024-12-25

Then, the user wants the cheapest flight, so sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST".

Also, need to check if adults and children are specified. The user didn't mention, so default adults=1.

Now, for the taxi part: need to book a taxi to the airport three hours before the flight, and return one hour after landing.

First, the departure flight is on Dec 5. Let's assume the flight time is, say, 10 AM. Then taxi should be at 7 AM on Dec 5.

But the user didn't specify flight times, so maybe after getting flight details, we can determine the departure time. However, the user is asking to book the taxi now, but without knowing the flight time, we can't set the pick-up time. Wait, but the user says "three hours before the flight takes off", so once the flight is booked, we can get the departure time and schedule the taxi accordingly. But since the user is asking to book the taxi as part of this request, perhaps we need to first get the flight details to know the departure time, then book the taxi.

But the user's message is a single request: find the cheapest flight and book taxis accordingly.

So steps:

1. Search for flights with the multi-stop legs, sorted by cheapest.

2. Once flight details are obtained (including departure times), then book taxi for departure (3 hours before flight) and return (1 hour after landing).

But since the user hasn't booked the flight yet, maybe the taxi booking is contingent on the flight details. However, the user is asking to "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands".

So first, need to find the flight, then use its departure and arrival times to schedule taxis.

But in the current step, the user is asking to find the flight and arrange taxis. So the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then use those times to call the taxi functions.

But the user hasn't provided flight times yet, so the assistant must first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight options, then from the selected flight's departure time, calculate the taxi times.

However, the user's query is to "find out about the cheapest connecting flight" and also book taxis. So the immediate next step is to search for the flights.

But the user also provided their address (600 Market St SF) for the taxi pick-up.

So for the taxi to the airport:

- Pick-up location: 600 Market St, San Francisco. Need to get the googlePlaceId for this address using Taxi_Search_Location.

- Drop-off: airport (SFO). Need to get SFO's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.

Similarly, for the return taxi:

- Pick-up: SFO airport (after landing)

- Drop-off: 600 Market St SF.

But the return flight lands in SF, so the taxi from SFO to 600 Market St.

But the user says "bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands". So the taxi pick-up time would be arrival time + 1 hour.

But again, without knowing the flight's arrival time, we can't set the exact time. So first, need flight details.

So the plan is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get airport IDs for SF, San Diego, Las Vegas.

2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs and sort=CHEAPEST.

3. From the flight results, get departure and arrival times.

4. Use Taxi_Search_Location to get googlePlaceId for 600 Market St SF and SFO airport.

5. Book taxi for departure: pick-up at 600 Market St, drop-off at SFO, time = flight departure time - 3 hours.

6. Book taxi for return: pick-up at SFO, drop-off at 600 Market St, time = flight arrival time + 1 hour.

But since the user hasn't selected a specific flight yet, the assistant can't proceed to book taxis without flight times. However, the user is asking to "book a taxi" as part of the request, so perhaps the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then use those to schedule taxis.

But in the current step, the user is asking for the cheapest flight and taxi booking. So the assistant should first call the flight search function, then based on the results, call the taxi functions.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls step by step.

First, to search for flights, need the airport location IDs. So first call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, the user mentioned San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas. So need to get the airport codes for these cities.

Let's start with San Francisco. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get SFO's ID.

Similarly for San Diego and Las Vegas.

Once we have those IDs, construct the legs for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

Then, after getting flight options, select the cheapest one, note departure and arrival times.

Then, for taxi:

- Outbound: from 600 Market St to SFO airport. Need to get googlePlaceId for 600 Market St and SFO airport via Taxi_Search_Location.

- Return: from SFO airport to 600 Market St.

So first, let's handle the flight part.

First tool call: Search_Flight_Location for "
