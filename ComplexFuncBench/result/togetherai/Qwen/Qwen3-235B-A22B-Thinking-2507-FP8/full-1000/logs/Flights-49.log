Okay, let's see. The user wants the cheapest economy class air ticket for a multi-stop trip. They're leaving New York on Nov 5, 2024, going through London on Nov 6, then to Berlin, and returning to New York on Nov 20.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The outbound journey has two stops: New York to London, then London to Berlin. The return is Berlin to New York. Wait, the user mentioned traveling through London on Nov 6, so the first leg is NY to London on Nov 5, then London to Berlin on Nov 6. Then return from Berlin to NY on Nov 20.

But the user said "travel through London on November 6th", so maybe the first flight arrives in London on the 6th. So departure from NY on 5th, arriving London 6th. Then London to Berlin on 6th? Wait, maybe the dates are departure dates. So legs would be:

Leg 1: From NY (JFK?) to London (LHR?) on 2024-11-05

Leg 2: From London to Berlin on 2024-11-06

Leg 3: From Berlin to NY on 2024-11-20

Wait, but the user said "return to New York on November 20th", so the return leg is Berlin to NY on 20th.

But the user mentioned "travel through London on November 6th", so the second leg (London to Berlin) departs on 6th.

So the legs array should have three legs? Wait, no. Wait, the user is going from NY -> London (stop) -> Berlin, then return. Wait, the user's plan is: set off from NY on Nov 5, travel through London on Nov 6, then fly to Berlin. So the first leg is NY to London (depart Nov 5, arrive Nov 6?), then London to Berlin (depart Nov 6). Then return from Berlin to NY on Nov 20.

So the outbound is two legs: NY to London, London to Berlin. Then return is Berlin to NY. Wait, but the user says "return to New York on November 20th", so the return flight is a single leg from Berlin to NY on 20th.

Wait, but the user's description is a bit unclear. Let me re-read: "set off from New York on November 5th, 2024, travel through London on November 6th and then fly to Berlin. Finally, I'll return to New York on November 20th, 2024."

So the trip is:

- Depart NY on Nov 5 (arrive London Nov 6?)

- Then from London to Berlin on Nov 6 (depart London Nov 6, arrive Berlin same day?)

- Then return from Berlin to NY on Nov 20.

So the legs for the outbound are two segments: NY to London, London to Berlin. Then the return is Berlin to NY. Wait, but the user didn't specify a return leg through another city, so it's a direct return.

But the user is asking for a multi-stop flight. Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for multi-stop flights. So the entire trip is a multi-stop: NY -> London -> Berlin -> NY? Or is it a round trip with two stops on the way there?

Wait, the user says: "set off from New York on November 5th, travel through London on November 6th and then fly to Berlin. Finally, I'll return to New York on November 20th."

So the outbound journey has two stops (London and Berlin), but actually, it's NY -> London (stop) -> Berlin. So the outbound is two legs. Then the return is Berlin -> NY, which is one leg. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for searching multi-stop flights, which I think refers to the outbound journey. Wait, the function description says "Search multi-stop Flights." So maybe the entire trip is considered as multiple legs, including the return? Or is the return a separate booking?

Wait, the user is asking for the cheapest economy class air ticket for the entire trip. So it's a round trip with multiple stops on the way there. But typically, multi-city flights can have multiple legs. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's legs parameter is an array of legs, so for a round trip with a stopover, it would be three legs: NY to London, London to Berlin, Berlin to NY. Wait, but the user's return is from Berlin to NY directly. So the legs would be:

1. NY to London (2024-11-05)

2. London to Berlin (2024-11-06)

3. Berlin to NY (2024-11-20)

But the user said "return to New York on November 20th", so the third leg is the return.

So the legs array should have three objects. Wait, but the user's description says "travel through London on November 6th and then fly to Berlin", so the first leg is NY to London (depart 5th, arrive 6th), then London to Berlin (depart 6th), then Berlin to NY on 20th.

Therefore, the legs array needs three entries:

- From NY to London on 2024-11-05

- From London to Berlin on 2024-11-06

- From Berlin to NY on 2024-11-20

But wait, the user might have meant that the return is a separate leg, but the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for one-way multi-stop. Wait, the function's description says "Search multi-stop Flights." Maybe it's for a single journey with multiple stops, not round trip. So perhaps the user's entire trip is a multi-city booking with three legs: NY -> London -> Berlin -> NY. But that's three legs. However, the user's return is from Berlin to NY, so legs would be:

1. NY to London (2024-11-05)

2. London to Berlin (2024-11-06)

3. Berlin to NY (2024-11-20)

But the function's legs parameter is an array of legs, so that's acceptable.

However, first, I need to get the location IDs for New York, London, and Berlin airports. The user mentioned "New York", "London", and "Berlin", but the function requires fromId and toId which are location IDs from the Search_Flight_Location endpoint.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the correct airport codes.

For example, New York airports might be JFK, EWR, LGA. London could be LHR, LGW, etc. Berlin is TXL or BER.

So I need to first search for each location to get the correct IDs.

The user didn't specify airports, so I need to find the main airports for each city.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get possible airports, then "London", then "Berlin".

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs.

But the user wants the cheapest economy class, so parameters would be cabinClass: ECONOMY, sort: CHEAPEST.

Also, adults: 1 (default), children: not mentioned, so probably 0.

So the plan is:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get fromId for first leg.

2. Call Search_Flight_Location for "London" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.

3. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Berlin" to get toId for second leg and fromId for third leg.

4. Then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the three legs, cabinClass ECONOMY, sort CHEAPEST.

But the user also wants to check flight details, including baggage limits, so after getting the flight tokens from the search, call Get_Flight_Details with the token.

But first, need to get the location IDs.

So the first tool calls should be Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, the user's message says: "Check the details of the flights. I want to know things like the baggage limit."

So the process is:

- Search for flights (multi-stops) to get the list, which includes tokens.

- Then use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get baggage info.

But to search for flights, need the location IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for New York, London, Berlin.

Let me structure the tool calls.

First, for New York:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "New York"

Then for London: query "London"

Then for Berlin: query "Berlin"

Assuming the top result for each is the main airport.

Once we have the IDs, construct the legs array.

For example:

New York -> JFK.AIRPORT

London -> LHR.AIRPORT

Berlin -> BER.AIRPORT

Then legs:

[

  {fromId: 'JFK.AIRPORT', toId: 'LHR.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-05'},

  {fromId: 'LHR.AIRPORT', toId: 'BER.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-06'},

  {fromId: 'BER.AIRPORT', toId: 'J
