2025-08-13 19:34:39,997 - evaluation_logger_Cross-133 - INFO - Query: Help me check the details of the fastest plane tickets from Montreal to Miami on November 20, 2024, and from Miami to Orlando on November 22, 2024. I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in Miami and Orlando for two days each. Please provide hotels within 30 kilometers of the related airports in Miami and Orlando based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to check the details of the fastest plane tickets for two separate trips: Montreal to Miami on November 20, 2024, and Miami to Orlando on November 22, 2024. They also need hotels within 30 km of the airports in Miami and Orlando based on the arrival airports of the flights.

First, I need to figure out the airports for each city. The user mentioned Montreal, Miami, and Orlando. So, I should use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the airport IDs for these cities. For Montreal, the main airport is YUL, Miami is MIA, and Orlando is MCO. But to be precise, I should call the Search_Flight_Location function with each city name to get the correct IDs.

Wait, the user specified "arrival airports of the flights," so for the first trip, Montreal to Miami, the arrival airport is Miami's airport (MIA), and for the second trip, Miami to Orlando, the arrival is Orlando's airport (MCO). But to get the exact IDs, I need to search each location.

So first step: Use Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando to get their respective airport IDs. Let's start with Montreal. The function requires a query parameter, so I'll call it with "Montreal". Similarly for Miami and Orlando.

Once I have the airport IDs (fromId and toId), I can then search for flights. The user wants the fastest flights, so for each trip, I'll use Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST. The first trip is Montreal (fromId) to Miami (toId) on Nov 20, 2024. The second trip is Miami (fromId) to Orlando (toId) on Nov 22, 2024.

After getting the flight details, the user wants to check the details of the tickets, which probably includes baggage, meals, etc. So for each flight search result, I need to get the token from Search_Flights and then call Get_Flight_Details with that token.

Then, for hotels, the user wants them within 30 km of the arrival airports (Miami and Orlando). To get the coordinates of the airports, I might need to use Location_to_Lat_Long for each airport's location. Wait, but airports have specific coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location response includes coordinates? The function description says it's for finding airports by location, but the parameters don't mention returning coordinates. Hmm.

Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates function requires latitude and longitude. So to get the coordinates of Miami and Orlando airports, I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names. For example, "Miami International Airport" and "Orlando International Airport".

So steps:

1. For each city (Montreal, Miami, Orlando), get airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use those IDs to search for flights (Search_Flights) with sort=FASTEST for each route and date.
3. For each flight search result, get the token and call Get_Flight_Details.
4. For Miami and Orlando airports, get their coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long.
5. Use those coordinates to search hotels within 30 km (radius=30) for each arrival airport.

Wait, the user said "based on the arrival airports of the flights". So for the first flight (Montreal to Miami), arrival airport is Miami's, so hotels near Miami airport. For the second flight (Miami to Orlando), arrival is Orlando's airport, so hotels near Orlando airport.

So first, get coordinates for Miami International Airport and Orlando International Airport.

Let me outline the tool calls needed:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Montreal" to get fromId for first flight.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Miami" to get toId for first flight and fromId for second flight.
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get toId for second flight.

Wait, but Miami's airport is MIA, Orlando's is MCO. But to be accurate, the Search_Flight_Location will return the correct IDs.

Then, for each flight:

- First flight: fromId (Montreal), toId (Miami), departDate 2024-11-20, sort=FASTEST.
- Second flight: fromId (Miami), toId (Orlando), departDate 2024-11-22, sort=FASTEST.

After getting flight details, need to get coordinates for Miami and Orlando airports to search hotels.

So next, Location_to_Lat_Long for "Miami International Airport" and "Orlando International Airport".

Then, Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date and departure_date based on the user's stay. The user says they stay in Miami and Orlando for two days each. So for Miami, arrival_date would be 2024-11-20 (flight arrival), departure_date 2024-11-22. For Orlando, arrival_date 2024-11-22, departure_date 2024-11-24.

Wait, the user says: "I'm going to stay in Miami and Orlando for two days each." So Miami stay is from Nov 20 to Nov 22 (2 days), Orlando from Nov 22 to Nov 24.

So for Miami hotels: arrival_date=2024-11-20, departure_date=2024-11-22.

For Orlando hotels: arrival_date=2024-11-22, departure_date=2024-11-24.

Radius is 30 km as per user's request.

So the tool calls needed are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Montreal
2. Search_Flight_Location for Miami
3. Search_Flight_Location for Orlando
4. Search_Flights for Montreal->Miami, sort=FASTEST
5. Search_Flights for Miami->Orlando, sort=FASTEST
6. For each flight search result, Get_Flight_Details (but need tokens from step 4 and 5)
7. Location_to_Lat_Long for Miami International Airport
8. Location_to_Lat_Long for Orlando International Airport
9. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Miami coordinates, dates 2024-11-20 to 22, radius 30
10. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Orlando coordinates, dates 2024-11-22 to 24, radius 30

But the user said "book the tickets separately", so they need details for each flight. So first, get the flight locations, then flights, then details, then hotels.

But the assistant can only make tool calls step by step. Since the user's query requires multiple steps, the assistant needs to make the necessary tool calls in order.

First, need to get the airport IDs for Montreal, Miami, Orlando. So first three tool calls are Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, but the user mentioned "arrival airports of the flights", so maybe the airports are specific. For example, Miami's main airport is MIA, but maybe the Search_Flight_Location will return the correct ID.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with "Montreal", "Miami", "Orlando" to get their respective IDs.

Then, use those IDs to search flights.

So the first set of tool calls would be three Search_Flight_Location calls.

Then, two Search_Flights calls.

Then, for each flight search, get the token and call Get_Flight_Details.

Then, get coordinates for the arrival airports (Miami and Orlando) using Location_to_Lat_Long.

Then, two Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates calls.

But the user's initial request is to "check the details of the fastest plane tickets" and "provide hotels".

So the assistant needs to first get the flight details, which requires the airport IDs, then the flights, then the details.

So the first step is to get the airport IDs.

Let me structure the tool calls:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Montreal"
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Miami"
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando"

Then, with the IDs from 1,2,3:

4. Search_Flights from Montreal ID to Miami ID, departDate 2024-11-20, sort=FASTEST
5. Search_Flights from Miami ID to Orlando ID, departDate 2024-11-22, sort=FASTEST

Then, for each of 4 and 5, get the token and call Get_Flight_Details.

But the user wants the details of the tickets, so after getting the flight search results (which include tokens), call Get_Flight_Details with those tokens.

Then, for hotels:

6. Location_to_Lat_Long for "Miami International Airport"
7. Location_to_Lat_Long for "Orlando International Airport"

Then:

8. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with Miami's lat/long, arrival_date 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22, radius 30
9. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with Orlando's lat/long, arrival_date 2024-11-22, departure_date 2024-11-24, radius 30

So the initial tool calls should be the three Search_Flight_Location calls.

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact airport names, so using the city
