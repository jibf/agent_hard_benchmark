Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near the Nantasket Beach Hotel (hotel_id 390545) and detailed descriptions.

First, I called Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel ID. It returned Boston Harbor Islands National Park as the closest landmark. Then, I used Search_Attraction_Location with that query to get the product details, which gave me the productSlug "prrdamvrdy8i-15-hour-boston-harbour-cruise". Next, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to get the full info.

Now, I need to present this info clearly. The main attraction is the Boston Harbor Sightseeing Cruise. I should mention the key points: duration (1.5 hours), the yacht name (Northern Lights), notable sights like Boston skyline, Old North Church, etc. Also include practical details like cancellation policy, price, and what's included. The user might want to know if it's suitable for kids, which the additional info says yes, but infants need advance notice for seats. Also, note the free cancellation and the price around $44.80. Make sure to structure it in a friendly, helpful way without too much jargon.
