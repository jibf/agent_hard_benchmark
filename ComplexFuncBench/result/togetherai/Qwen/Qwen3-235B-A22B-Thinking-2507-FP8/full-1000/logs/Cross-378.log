Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want two main things: first, check sightseeing routes near the DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort for the day after tomorrow, and second, reserve a taxi from the hotel to the airport three hours after the tour ends.

Starting with the first part. The user mentioned "sightseeing routes for attractions near the hotel". To get attractions near the hotel, I need the hotel_id. But the user provided the hotel name: DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort. So I need to find the hotel_id first. Wait, the tools available include Search_Hotel_Destination, which can find hotels by location. But maybe there's another way. Wait, the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function requires a hotel_id. So first, I need to get the hotel_id for DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function is for finding hotels by location, but the user is giving the hotel name. Hmm, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination can take the hotel name as a query? The description says "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc." So maybe querying with the hotel name would work. Let me check the parameters: it requires a query string. So I can call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort" to get the hotel details, which should include the hotel_id.

Once I have the hotel_id, I can use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with that hotel_id to get the attractions. The user wants this for the day after tomorrow. Today is November 25, 2024, so day after tomorrow is November 27. But the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function doesn't take a date parameter. Wait, the function description says it's for popular attractions around the hotel, but maybe availability is checked later. Wait, the next step is to check availability for the attractions. Wait, the user said "check the sightseeing routes", which might involve knowing which attractions are available on that date.

Wait, the Get_Availability function checks ticket availability for attractions, requiring a slug and date. So after getting the attractions near the hotel (which would give slugs), we need to check availability for November 27.

But first, let's outline the steps:

1. Find the hotel_id for DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort".
2. Use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id to get the list of attractions (which should include their slugs).
3. For each attraction, check availability on November 27 using Get_Availability with slug and date 2024-11-27.
4. Once attractions are confirmed available, determine the tour end time. But the user hasn't specified the tour duration, so maybe the availability response includes timing? Not sure. The user says "reserve a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours after the tour ends". So we need to know when the tour ends. But without specific tour times, maybe the availability data includes operating hours? Hmm, this might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects a generic reservation three hours after the tour, but we need to know the end time. Maybe the attractions' availability includes time slots, but the Get_Availability function's description says it checks if tickets are available for a date, not specific times. Wait, the parameters for Get_Availability include a date (YYYY-MM-DD), but not time. So maybe the availability is per day, not per time slot. So the tour would be on that day, but the exact end time isn't specified. The user says "three hours after the tour ends", but without knowing when the tour ends, how can we set the taxi time?

Wait, perhaps the user expects that once the attractions are listed, we can assume a typical tour duration, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the taxi reservation is to be made for a time three hours after the attractions' closing time. But without specific data, this is tricky. However, the user's instruction is to reserve the taxi three hours after the tour ends, so we need to know the tour end time. Since the problem doesn't provide that, maybe the assistant is supposed to proceed with the information available, perhaps assuming that the tour ends at a certain time, but the user hasn't specified. Wait, the user says "the day after tomorrow" for the sightseeing, which is Nov 27. The taxi is to pick up three hours after the tour ends on that day.

But to book the taxi, we need the pick_up_time and pick_up_date. The date would be Nov 27, and the time would be (tour end time + 3 hours). However, without knowing the tour end time, we can't set the exact time. But maybe the attractions' availability response includes operating hours, so after getting the attractions, we can find their closing times, sum them up for the tour duration, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the assistant will first get the attractions, then check their availability (which might include time slots), then determine the end time.

But given the tools available, let's proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel name to get the hotel_id.

Then, use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with that hotel_id to get the attractions.

Then, for each attraction, call Get_Availability with date 2024-11-27 to check if they're available.

Assuming the attractions are available, we need to figure out the tour end time. But since the tools don't provide operating hours, maybe the user just wants the taxi booked for a time three hours after a hypothetical tour end, but without specific info, perhaps the assistant should proceed to book the taxi with a placeholder time, but the user says "three hours after the tour ends", so the exact time depends on the tour.

Wait, but the user's instruction is to "reserve a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours after the tour ends". So the taxi reservation needs the pick-up time, which is tour end time + 3 hours. But without knowing the tour end time, we can't set it. However, perhaps the tour end time is derived from the attractions' availability. For example, if the last attraction's time slot ends at 5 PM, then taxi at 8 PM.

But given the tools, Get_Availability only checks if tickets are available on a date, not specific times. So maybe the availability API doesn't provide time slots, which complicates things. The user might have an incomplete request, but as an assistant, I need to proceed with the available tools.

Alternatively, maybe the "sightseeing routes" imply a standard tour duration, but that's an assumption. However, the problem states to use the provided tools, so perhaps the assistant should first get the attractions, then proceed to book the taxi with a time that's three hours after the date's end, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the user expects that after getting the list of attractions, the assistant can proceed to book the taxi for a time three hours after the attractions' typical closing time, but without data, this is guesswork.

Given the constraints, the assistant should first retrieve the hotel_id, then the attractions, then check their availability, and then for the taxi, perhaps use the date of the tour (Nov 27) and a time that's three hours after a standard tour end, but since the exact time isn't known, maybe the user expects the assistant to proceed with the information available, perhaps leaving the time as a variable.

But the taxi reservation requires pick_up_time in HH:MM format. So the assistant needs to determine that time. Since the tour is on Nov 27, and the taxi is three hours after the tour ends, but without knowing when the tour ends, perhaps the assistant should first get the attractions' details to find their operating hours, but the available tools don't include that. The Get_Availability function might return more data, but according to the tool description, it's just checking availability for a date.

Hmm, this is a bit of a snag. Maybe the user expects that the assistant will proceed to book the taxi with a time that's three hours after the date's end, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the tour is assumed to end at a certain time, like 5 PM, so taxi at 8 PM. But this is an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant should first get the attractions, then for each, check availability, and perhaps the response includes time slots, but the tool description doesn't specify that. The Get_Availability parameters only require date, not time, so it's possible that availability is per day, not per time slot.

Given that, perhaps the user's request to reserve a taxi three hours after the tour ends cannot be fully fulfilled without knowing the tour end time, but the assistant should proceed to book the taxi for the same day (Nov 27) at a time three hours after a placeholder, but the system requires specific time.

Wait, the user says "the day after tomorrow" which is Nov 27. The taxi is to pick up three hours after the tour ends on that day. So the pick_up_date is 2024-11-27, and pick_up_time is [tour end time + 3 hours]. But without tour end time, perhaps the assistant needs to make an assumption or ask for clarification, but since this is a tool call exercise, the assistant must proceed with the available tools.

Wait, maybe the sightseeing routes' end time can be derived from the attractions' availability. For example, if the availability
