2025-08-13 20:09:08,875 - evaluation_logger_Cross-226 - INFO - Query: On December 10, 2024, I'll travel from Fukuoka to Tokyo. Two days later, I'll fly from Tokyo to Hawaii. I need to book the cheapest flights for this multi-stop trip. I plan to stay at the HOTEL 1899 TOKYO in Tokyo, can you check whether the hotel is available on those dates? Don't forget to arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Tokyo airport on the 12th.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight: Fukuoka to Tokyo on December 10, 2024, then Tokyo to Hawaii on December 12. They want the cheapest option. Then, check availability at HOTEL 1899 TOKYO for those dates. Also, arrange a taxi from the hotel to Tokyo airport three hours before the flight on the 12th.

Starting with the flights. The user mentioned multi-stop, so I need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. But first, I need the airport IDs for Fukuoka, Tokyo, and Hawaii. The function Search_Flight_Location can get those. Let me check the parameters. The query is the location name. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Fukuoka, Tokyo, and Hawaii to get their IDs.

Wait, the user said "Hawaii" but Hawaii is a state, so maybe the main airport is HNL (Honolulu). But the function will handle the query. So first, get the IDs for each location.

Next, the legs array for the flights: first leg Fukuoka to Tokyo on 2024-12-10, second leg Tokyo to Hawaii on 2024-12-12. Need to make sure the dates are correct. The user says "two days later" from Dec 10, so Dec 12 is correct.

Then, cabin class and sort by cheapest. The sort parameter should be CHEAPEST.

After flights, check hotel availability. The hotel is HOTEL 1899 TOKYO. Need to find its hotel_id. So first, use Search_Hotels to find the hotel by name? Wait, the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. But the user provided the hotel name directly. Hmm, maybe first use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "HOTEL 1899 TOKYO" to get the location ID, but actually, Search_Hotel_Destination is for locations like cities, not specific hotels. Wait, the description says "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc." So maybe to get the hotel_id, we need to use Search_Hotels with the destination ID. Wait, the user knows the hotel name, so perhaps first search for the hotel using Search_Hotels, but that requires dest_id. Alternatively, maybe Search_Hotel_Destination can help find the location ID for Tokyo, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id and maybe filter by hotel name? But the parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a hotel name field. Hmm, this might be a problem. Wait, the Get_Room_List_With_Availability requires hotel_id, which comes from Search_Hotels or Search_HotelsByCoordinates. So perhaps first, we need to find the hotel_id for HOTEL 1899 TOKYO. To do that, maybe use Search_Hotels with the destination ID for Tokyo. So first, get Tokyo's dest_id via Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Tokyo", then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date Dec 10, departure_date Dec 12, and maybe filter by hotel name. But the Search_Hotels parameters don't have a hotel name field. Wait, the description says "Search Hotels" but the parameters include search_type, dest_id, etc. Maybe the hotel name is part of the search_type? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hotel_id can be found through another method. This might require multiple steps.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that we can directly get the hotel_id if we know the name, but according to the tools provided, the hotel_id is retrieved from Search_Hotels or Search_HotelsByCoordinates. So perhaps first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Tokyo" to get the dest_id, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-12-10, departure_date 2024-12-12, and maybe other parameters to find the specific hotel. But without a name parameter, it's tricky. Maybe the hotel name is part of the response data, so we have to search and then filter. But as a tool call, we can only make the function calls as per the parameters. So perhaps first, get the dest_id for Tokyo via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id to get a list of hotels, and then from the response, find the hotel_id for HOTEL 1899 TOKYO. But since we can't process the response here, the assistant has to make the tool calls step by step.

So first step: get airport IDs for Fukuoka, Tokyo, Hawaii using Search_Flight_Location.

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs array.

Then, for the hotel: get dest_id for Tokyo via Search_Hotel_Destination, then Search_Hotels with that dest_id to find the hotel_id for HOTEL 1899 TOKYO, then check availability with Get_Room_List_With_Availability.

For the taxi: need to get googlePlaceId for the hotel (using Taxi_Search_Location with query "HOTEL 1899 TOKYO") and for Tokyo airport (using Taxi_Search_Location with "Tokyo airport"). Then, the flight on 12th, so need to know the departure time to set pick-up time three hours before. But the user hasn't provided flight times, so maybe the taxi time is based on the flight's departure time, which we might get from the flight search response. But since we can't process responses, perhaps the assistant will need to first get the flight details, then use that time for the taxi. However, the user says "three hours before my flight", so the pick-up time depends on the flight's departure time. But since the flight hasn't been booked yet, maybe the taxi search can be done after knowing the flight time. But in the tool calls, we need to structure it step by step.

So the order of tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Fukuoka, Tokyo, Hawaii to get their IDs.
2. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flights.
3. From the flight response, get the departure time for the Tokyo to Hawaii flight on Dec 12, then calculate pick-up time (three hours before).
4. Search_Hotel_Destination for Tokyo to get dest_id.
5. Search_Hotels with dest_id to find HOTEL 1899 TOKYO's hotel_id.
6. Get_Room_List_With_Availability for that hotel_id on the dates.
7. Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel and Tokyo airport to get place IDs.
8. Search_Taxi with those place IDs and calculated pick-up time.

But since the assistant can only make tool calls based on the user's query without knowing previous responses, we need to make the initial calls that don't depend on prior results.

First, for the flights: need to get the location IDs. So first tool calls are Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Then, once we have the IDs, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

Similarly, for the hotel, first get Tokyo's dest_id via Search_Hotel_Destination, then Search_Hotels.

For the taxi, need place IDs for the hotel and airport, so call Taxi_Search_Location for both.

But the user mentioned "HOTEL 1899 TOKYO", so Taxi_Search_Location query would be that hotel name.

So the initial tool calls should be:

- Search_Flight_Location for "Fukuoka"
- Search_Flight_Location for "Tokyo"
- Search_Flight_Location for "Hawaii"

Then, Search_Hotel_Destination for "Tokyo" (to get dest_id for hotel search)

Taxi_Search_Location for "HOTEL 1899 TOKYO" and "Tokyo airport"

Wait, but the user said "arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight". The flight from Tokyo to Hawaii is on Dec 12. So the taxi is on Dec 12, pick-up time is three hours before the flight departure time. But the flight departure time isn't known yet; it's part of the flight search result. So after getting the flight details, we can determine the pick-up time. But since we can't process the response, the assistant would need to first get the flight info, then use that time for the taxi. However, in the tool calls, we can only make the initial calls that don't require prior data.

So the first step is to get all necessary location IDs.

Let me structure the tool calls:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Fukuoka" to get fromId for first leg.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Tokyo" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Hawaii" to get toId for second leg.

Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs:

[
  {fromId: Fukuoka ID, toId: Tokyo ID, date: 2024-12-10},
  {fromId: Tokyo ID, toId: Hawaii ID, date: 2024-12-12}
]

Sort by CHEAPEST.

Next, for the hotel:

4. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Tokyo" to get dest_id.

5. Search_Hotels with dest_id (from step 4), arrival_date
