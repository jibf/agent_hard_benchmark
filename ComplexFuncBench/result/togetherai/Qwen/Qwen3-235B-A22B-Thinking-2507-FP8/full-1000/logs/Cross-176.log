2025-08-13 19:53:15,567 - evaluation_logger_Cross-176 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Hotel Route-Inn Sakaide-Kita Inter in Takamatsu, with hotel_id 404817. First, I called Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with that hotel ID. It returned Takamatsu Symbol Tower as the closest landmark.

Then, I used Search_Attraction_Location with "Takamatsu Symbol Tower" to get more details. The response had a productSlug which I used in Get_Attraction_Details. The details show it's a private shore excursion including Udon making and Ritsurin Park.

Wait, but the user wanted attractions near the hotel. The Symbol Tower is 11.95 km away. The excursion is from the port, which might be the same area. But maybe there's a mix-up here. The Symbol Tower is a landmark, but the attraction details are for a tour. Maybe the Symbol Tower is part of the tour route?

I should check if the distance makes sense. 11.95 km is about 7.4 miles, which is a bit far for "near" the hotel. Maybe the API's closest_landmarks includes things within a certain radius, but the user might expect closer spots. However, the data provided only lists that one attraction.

I need to present the info clearly. Explain the Symbol Tower is the closest, then detail the excursion which includes visiting Ritsurin Park and Udon experience. Note the distance, but since it's the only result, that's what we have. Also mention the tour's inclusions and cancellation policy as per the data.
