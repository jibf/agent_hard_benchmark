Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to travel from New York to Los Angeles on December 1, 2024. First, I need to find the best air tickets. To do that, I'll need the flight search function. But before that, I need the airport codes or location IDs for New York and Los Angeles. The user mentioned Shangri-La Hotel New York and Marriott Hotel Los Angeles, so maybe the airports are JFK, LAX, etc. But the function requires fromId and toId from the Search_Flight_Location endpoint.

So first step: Use Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the departure airport ID. Then do the same for "Los Angeles" to get the arrival ID. Once I have those IDs, I can call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate as 2024-12-01, and sort by BEST.

Next, the taxi arrangements. The user wants a taxi from Shangri-La Hotel New York to the airport at 10 AM. So I need to get the googlePlaceId for the hotel and the airport. Wait, the taxi search requires pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. For the pickup, it's the hotel. So first, use Taxi_Search_Location for "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get its place ID. Then, for the drop-off at the airport, maybe use the same Search_Flight_Location to get the airport's place ID? Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location is for taxi locations, so maybe the airport's place ID can be found via Taxi_Search_Location as well. Alternatively, the airport's name from the flight search might be used here.

Wait, the user says "leave Shangri-La Hotel New York for the airport", so the pickup is the hotel, drop-off is the airport in New York. Then, on arrival in LA, the taxi should pick up from the airport and take to Marriott Hotel Los Angeles.

So for the first taxi (NYC): pickup is Shangri-La Hotel, drop-off is NYC airport (like JFK). For the second taxi (LA): pickup is LA airport (LAX), drop-off is Marriott Hotel LA.

But to get the place IDs, I need to call Taxi_Search_Location for each location. So first, for the NYC hotel: query "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get its googlePlaceId. Then, for the NYC airport, maybe query "John F. Kennedy International Airport" or "New York Airport" to get its place ID. Similarly for LA airport and Marriott Hotel LA.

Wait, the user didn't specify which airport in NYC or LA, but typically JFK, EWR, LGA for NYC, and LAX for LA. But the flight search would have used the correct airport ID, which might correspond to a specific airport. However, the taxi search needs the exact place ID. So perhaps after getting the flight's fromId and toId (which are airport IDs), we can use those airport names to search via Taxi_Search_Location.

Alternatively, maybe the flight location IDs can be used directly, but the Taxi_Search_Location requires a query string. So perhaps first, get the airport names from the flight search locations.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Search for flight locations for New York to get fromId (e.g., JFK's ID).
2. Search for flight locations for Los Angeles to get toId (e.g., LAX's ID).
3. Use those IDs to search flights on Dec 1, 2024.
4. For taxi from hotel to NYC airport:
   a. Search Taxi_Location for "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get pickup place ID.
   b. Search Taxi_Location for the NYC airport name (from step 1) to get drop-off place ID.
5. For taxi from LA airport to hotel:
   a. Search Taxi_Location for the LA airport name (from step 2) to get pickup place ID.
   b. Search Taxi_Location for "Marriott Hotel Los Angeles" to get drop-off place ID.
6. Then call Search_Taxi for both trips with the respective place IDs, dates, and times.

But the user specified leaving the hotel at 10 AM for the airport. So the pickup time for the first taxi is 10 AM on Dec 1, 2024. The return taxi in LA would need to be scheduled for the arrival time of the flight, but the user says "when the plane lands", so we need the flight's arrival time. However, the user hasn't provided flight details yet, so maybe the taxi in LA is to be arranged based on the flight's arrival, but since we don't have the flight info yet, perhaps the user expects to set the pickup time as the expected arrival time. But since the flight search hasn't been done, maybe the taxi for LA will be scheduled for the same day, but the exact time depends on the flight. However, the user's instruction says "the taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands", so the pickup time would be the flight's arrival time. But since we don't have that yet, perhaps the assistant will need to first get the flight details, then schedule the taxi. But the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, so maybe assume the flight arrives on the same day, and the taxi is scheduled for the arrival date and time. However, without knowing the flight duration, it's tricky. But the user might just want the taxi booked for the arrival date, same day, but the exact time might need to be estimated. However, the user hasn't specified the return date, only departure on Dec 1. Wait, the user says "leave New York for Los Angeles on December 1, 2024", so departure date is Dec 1, and return date isn't mentioned. Wait, the user says "visit my friends", so it's a one-way trip? Or round trip? The user didn't specify return date, but the Search_Flights function requires returnDate only if it's a round trip. Wait, looking at the Search_Flights parameters: required are toId, fromId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional. So the user is probably doing a one-way trip, so returnDate isn't needed. But the taxi to the airport is on Dec 1 at 10 AM, and the taxi from LA airport would be on the same day, Dec 1, but the arrival time depends on the flight duration. However, the user says "when the plane lands", so the pickup time for the LA taxi would be the arrival time of the flight. But since we don't have the flight details yet, perhaps the assistant needs to first get the flight info, then use that to set the LA taxi time. But the user is asking to arrange both now, so maybe the assistant will have to make two separate tool calls: first for flights, then for taxis, but since the flight info is needed for the LA taxi time, perhaps the initial step is to get the flight locations, then flights, then use flight arrival time for the LA taxi. However, the user's current query is to help look up the best air tickets and arrange taxis, so the assistant needs to call the necessary functions step by step.

But according to the problem statement, the assistant should call the functions needed based on the user's query, even if some parameters are missing, but the required parameters must be present. So for the flight search, we need fromId and toId, which require using Search_Flight_Location first.

So the first tool calls should be:

1. Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get toId.

Then, use those IDs to call Search_Flights with departDate 2024-12-01, sort BEST.

Then, for the taxis:

For the NYC taxi:
- Pickup: Shangri-La Hotel New York. Need to call Taxi_Search_Location with "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get pick_up_place_id.
- Drop-off: NYC airport (from the fromId's airport name). So after getting the fromId from Search_Flight_Location, we might know the airport name (e.g., JFK), then call Taxi_Search_Location with "John F. Kennedy International Airport" to get drop_off_place_id.

Similarly, for the LA taxi:
- Pickup: LA airport (from toId's airport name, e.g., LAX), so Taxi_Search_Location for "Los Angeles International Airport".
- Drop-off: Marriott Hotel Los Angeles, so Taxi_Search_Location for "Marriott Hotel Los Angeles".

Then, call Search_Taxi for both trips with the respective place IDs, dates, and times.

The user specified leaving the hotel at 10 AM on Dec 1, so pick_up_time is 10:00, pick_up_date 2024-12-01 for the first taxi.

For the LA taxi, the pick_up_time would be the flight's arrival time. But since we don't have the flight details yet, perhaps the assistant can't set that yet. However, the user says "the taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands", so the pickup time is the arrival time of the flight. But without knowing the flight's arrival time, we can't set it. However, maybe the Search_Flights response will include arrival times, so the assistant would need to first get the flight info, then use that to schedule the taxi. But in the current step, the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, so perhaps the assistant will have to make the taxi search for LA with a placeholder time, but the required parameters for Search_Taxi include pick_up_time and pick_up_date
