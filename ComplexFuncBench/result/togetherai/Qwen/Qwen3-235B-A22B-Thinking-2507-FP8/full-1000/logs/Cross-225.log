I need to book the fastest flights for this multi-stop trip. I plan to stay at the ibis Styles Paris Bercy in Paris, can you check whether the hotel is available on those dates? Don't forget to arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Paris airport on the 17th.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight from Beijing to Paris on November 15, 2024, then Paris to London on November 17. They want the fastest flights. Then, check hotel availability at ibis Styles Paris Bercy for those dates. Also, arrange a taxi pickup from the hotel three hours before the flight on the 17th.

Starting with the flights. To search multi-stop flights, I need the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. But first, I need the airport IDs for Beijing, Paris, and London. So I should use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned Beijing to Paris first. Let me check Beijing's airport. The main airport in Beijing is PEK (Beijing Capital International Airport). But the function requires using Search_Flight_Location with the query "Beijing" to get the correct ID. Same for Paris and London.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing, Paris, and London to get their respective IDs.

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs array for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. The legs would be:
- From Beijing ID to Paris ID on 2024-11-15
- From Paris ID to London ID on 2024-11-17

Also, the user wants the fastest flights, so sort parameter should be "FASTEST".

Next, check hotel availability. The hotel is ibis Styles Paris Bercy. Need to find its hotel ID. To do that, use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Paris" to get dest_id, but maybe better to search directly for the hotel. Wait, Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. But first, need to get the dest_id for Paris. Wait, the user specified the hotel name, so maybe use Search_Hotels with the hotel name? Wait, the Search_Hotels function parameters include search_type, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. Hmm.

Wait, the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first, use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Paris" to get the dest_id for Paris. Then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-15, departure_date 2024-11-17, and maybe filter by hotel name? But the parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a hotel name filter. Wait, the description says "search_type can be retrieved from Search Hotel Destination", but maybe the hotel name is part of the search. Alternatively, maybe after getting the list of hotels in Paris, we can look for ibis Styles Paris Bercy. But the function might not have a direct name parameter. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the hotel's exact name can be used in the query for Search_Hotel_Destination? Wait, no. Search_Hotel_Destination is for locations, not specific hotels. So perhaps the correct approach is to first get the dest_id for Paris using Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival and departure dates, and then filter the results for the specific hotel name. But since the function parameters don't include a hotel name, maybe the API expects that the hotel name is part of the search via other parameters. Wait, the Search_Hotels function's description says "search_type can be retrieved from Search Hotel Destination", which might refer to the type of destination (like city, region, etc.), but not the hotel name.

This is a problem. Maybe the user expects that we can search for the hotel by name through another function. Wait, looking back at the tools provided, there's Get_Room_List_With_Availability which requires hotel_id. But to get hotel_id, we need to first use Search_Hotels. So perhaps the process is:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Paris" to get dest_id.
2. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-15, departure_date 2024-11-17, and other parameters. But how to specify the hotel name? The parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a name field. Maybe the API allows passing the hotel name in some other parameter, but according to the tool description, it's not there. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that we can find the hotel ID through another means, but given the tools provided, perhaps we have to assume that the hotel name is part of the search via the dest_id and then filter the results. But since the assistant can't process the response, it's up to the function to return the correct hotel. So perhaps the correct step is to call Search_Hotels with the Paris dest_id and dates, and then in the response, the hotel_id for ibis Styles Paris Bercy would be present. But since the assistant can't do that, the function call must be made with the correct parameters, even if the hotel name isn't directly specified. Wait, but the user specifically mentioned the hotel name, so maybe the Search_Hotels function has a parameter for hotel name that's not listed here? Looking back at the tool description for Search_Hotels:

Parameters include: sort_by, search_type, categories_filter, price_min, price_max, children_age, adults, arrival_date, room_qty, dest_id, departure_date.

No hotel name parameter. So perhaps the search_type is supposed to include the hotel name? Or maybe the dest_id is specific enough. Wait, maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination returns a list of destinations, and one of them is the specific hotel. But the description says "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc." So maybe querying "ibis Styles Paris Bercy" in Search_Hotel_Destination would return the dest_id for that hotel. Let me check the tool description for Search_Hotel_Destination: "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So perhaps if you search for the hotel name, it returns the specific location. So maybe the correct approach is to call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "ibis Styles Paris Bercy" to get the dest_id for that specific hotel. Then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

Wait, but the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, which is from Search_Hotel_Destination. So if I search for the hotel name in Search_Hotel_Destination, it might return the dest_id corresponding to that hotel. Let's assume that's possible.

So steps for hotel:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "ibis Styles Paris Bercy" to get dest_id.
2. Then call Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-15, departure_date 2024-11-17, etc.

But the user wants to check availability, which would be done via Get_Room_List_With_Availability, which requires hotel_id. So after getting the hotel_id from Search_Hotels, call Get_Room_List_With_Availability.

But the assistant can only make function calls, not process responses. So the correct sequence is:

- Search_Hotel_Destination for the hotel name to get dest_id.
- Search_Hotels with that dest_id to get hotel_id.
- Then Get_Room_List_With_Availability with hotel_id and dates.

But the user's instruction is to "check whether the hotel is available on those dates", so the final step is Get_Room_List_With_Availability.

Now for the taxi: need to pick up from the hotel three hours before the flight on the 17th. The flight from Paris to London is on the 17th. Assuming the flight time is, say, 10 AM, pickup would be 7 AM. But the exact flight time isn't known yet. However, the user says "three hours before my flight", so once the flight is booked, the time would be known. But since we're in the planning phase, maybe the taxi needs to be arranged based on the flight departure time. However, the user hasn't booked the flight yet, so perhaps the taxi arrangement is contingent on the flight time. But the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, so maybe we need to assume a typical flight time or perhaps the flight time will be determined after booking the flights.

But the user's instruction is to "arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Paris airport on the 17th." So the taxi pickup time depends on the flight time. Since the flight hasn't been booked yet, perhaps the taxi arrangement can't be finalized until the flight time is known. However, the user is asking to arrange it now, so maybe the assistant should proceed to book the taxi once the flight time is known. But since the flight search is part of the process, perhaps after getting the flight details (which includes departure time), then the taxi can be scheduled.

But the user's current request is to "arrange for a taxi", so the assistant needs to make the taxi search call. To do that, need pick_up_place_id (hotel's googlePlaceId) and drop_off_place_id (Paris airport's googlePlaceId). Also, pick_up_date and pick_up_time.

So steps for taxi:

1. Get the hotel's location via Taxi_Search_Location with query "ibis Styles Paris Bercy" to
