Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want to book the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20, 2024, with no overnight layovers. Then, they need a hotel near the Downtown Aquarium in Denver for five days. Finally, a taxi from the airport to the hotel one hour after landing.

Starting with the flight. The user specified "cheapest," so the sort parameter should be CHEAPEST. The dates: departure is December 20, 2024. They didn't mention a return date, but since they're staying five days, the return would be December 25. Wait, but the flight search might need a return date if it's a round trip. Wait, the user says "book the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20," which sounds like a one-way trip. But then they mention a five-day stay, so maybe it's a round trip? Wait, the user says "book the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20, 2024" – that's the departure. Then the hotel is for five days, so arrival on the 20th, staying until the 25th. So the flight is one-way? Or maybe they need a return flight. Wait, the user didn't specify return, but the hotel is for five days, so departure on 20th, return on 25th. But the user says "book the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20" – maybe it's a one-way, but the hotel is for five days, so they need to return. Hmm, but the user didn't mention return flight. Wait, the problem says "book the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20, 2024; I don't accept flights with overnight layovers." So it's a one-way flight on that date. But then the hotel is for five days, so arrival on 20th, check out on 25th. Then the taxi is from airport to hotel one hour after flight lands.

But for the flight search, the required parameters are toId, fromId, departDate. So first, need to get the airport IDs for Philadelphia and Denver. So I need to use Search_Flight_Location for both cities to get their IDs.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location with query "Philadelphia" to get fromId, then "Denver" for toId.

Once we have those IDs, call Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST, fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-20. Also, the user doesn't want overnight layovers, but the API parameters don't mention layover restrictions. Maybe the API handles that, or maybe the user's constraint is just to note, but the function call might not have a parameter for that. So proceed with the search.

Next, hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver. Need to find the destination ID for Downtown Aquarium. So use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Downtown Aquarium, Denver". That should give the dest_id. Then, arrival date is December 20, departure December 25 (5 days). Then call Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date=2024-12-20, departure_date=2024-12-25, sort_by=price (since cheapest?), but user didn't specify hotel price, but maybe default. Wait, the user says "book a hotel near Downtown Aquarium", so proximity is key. The sort_by parameter has 'distance' as an option, so maybe sort_by=distance.

Then, taxi from airport to hotel. Need pick_up_place_id (airport's googlePlaceId) and drop_off_place_id (hotel's location). But first, need to get the airport's googlePlaceId. Wait, for the taxi, the pick_up is the airport in Denver, so need to use Taxi_Search_Location for Denver airport. But which airport? Denver International Airport (DEN). So query "Denver International Airport" to get its googlePlaceId. Then, the drop_off is the hotel, but the hotel's address isn't known yet. Wait, after booking the hotel, we'd have its address, but in the tool calls, we need to first get the hotel's location. Hmm, but the user hasn't booked the hotel yet; we need to find a hotel near Downtown Aquarium, then get its location for the taxi.

Wait, the process is: first, find the hotel's location (using Search_Hotels), which would give the hotel's address, then use that address to get the googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location for the drop_off. But the Search_Hotels function returns hotel details, but the tool parameters for Search_Hotels require dest_id, which we get from Search_Hotel_Destination.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. For flights:
   a. Search_Flight_Location for "Philadelphia" to get fromId.
   b. Search_Flight_Location for "Denver" to get toId.
   c. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-20, sort=CHEAPEST.

2. For hotel:
   a. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Downtown Aquarium, Denver" to get dest_id.
   b. Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date=2024-12-20, departure_date=2024-12-25, sort_by=distance.

3. For taxi:
   a. Need pick_up_place_id: Denver airport. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Denver International Airport" to get its googlePlaceId.
   b. Drop_off_place_id: the hotel's address. But after getting the hotel from Search_Hotels, we need to get its exact location. However, the Search_Hotels function might return the hotel's address, which can then be used in Taxi_Search_Location to get the googlePlaceId. But since we can't do that in one step, perhaps first get the hotel's address via Search_Hotels, then use that address in Taxi_Search_Location. But the user hasn't specified a particular hotel, so maybe the hotel's location is near Downtown Aquarium, so perhaps the dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination is sufficient? Wait, no. The Taxi_Search_Location needs the specific place ID for the hotel. So after finding the hotel via Search_Hotels, we need to get its address, then search for that address to get the googlePlaceId.

But in the tool calls, we can't do that in one go. So the assistant would need to first get the hotel's address, then use that to get the place ID. However, the user's instruction is to book the hotel, so perhaps the Search_Hotels function returns the necessary location data. But according to the tool definitions, Search_Hotels requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. The Search_Hotel_Destination gives the latitude and longitude for the search query (like Downtown Aquarium). But the hotel itself would have its own coordinates.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says: "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So if we search for "Downtown Aquarium, Denver", it gives the lat/long of that location, which is the dest_id used in Search_Hotels. Then Search_Hotels uses that dest_id to find hotels near there.

But for the taxi drop-off, we need the specific hotel's address. However, the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet; they just want one near Downtown Aquarium. So perhaps the taxi drop-off would be the Downtown Aquarium area, but the user said "near Downtown Aquarium", so maybe the hotel is in that vicinity, and the taxi would go to the hotel's address. But without knowing the exact hotel, it's tricky. However, the assistant's job is to make the tool calls as per the user's request, assuming that subsequent steps will handle it.

Wait, the user says "book a hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver", so the assistant needs to find such a hotel. So first, get the dest_id for Downtown Aquarium via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id to find available hotels. Once a hotel is selected (though the tool call doesn't book, just searches), then get the hotel's address, then use Taxi_Search_Location on that address to get the drop_off_place_id.

But in the current step, the assistant is to make the necessary tool calls. So for the taxi, we need both pick_up and drop_off place IDs. The pick_up is Denver airport, so we need to get its place ID via Taxi_Search_Location. The drop_off is the hotel, which requires first finding the hotel's address via Search_Hotels, then searching for that address.

But since the user hasn't specified a particular hotel, perhaps the assistant will have to assume that after searching for hotels near Downtown Aquarium, one is selected, and its address is used. However, in the tool calls, we can't do that in one step. So the assistant needs to first call Search_Hotel_Destination for the aquarium, then Search_Hotels, then for the taxi, call Taxi_Search_Location for the airport and for the hotel's address.

But the problem is that the hotel's address isn't known until after Search_Hotels is called. So the assistant's first step is to call the necessary functions to gather the required IDs.

So the order of tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Philadelphia and Denver to get fromId and toId.
2. Search_Flights with
