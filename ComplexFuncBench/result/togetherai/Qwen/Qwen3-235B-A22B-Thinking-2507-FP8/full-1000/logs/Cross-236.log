Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want to book the cheapest flight from Denver to Philadelphia on November 15, 2024, with no overnight layovers. Then, they need a hotel near Independence National Historical Park for three days. Finally, a taxi from the airport to the hotel one hour after landing.

Starting with the flight. The user specified "cheapest," so I should use the Search_Flights function with sort set to CHEAPEST. But first, I need the airport IDs for Denver and Philadelphia. The Search_Flight_Location function can get those. Let me check the parameters: query is required. So I'll call Search_Flight_Location for "Denver" and "Philadelphia" to get their IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned no overnight layovers. The Search_Flights function might not have a direct parameter for that, but maybe the response will include flight details where I can check layover durations. However, the initial step is to get the flight options. So first, get the location IDs.

Next, the hotel. They want it near Independence National Historical Park. So use Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Independence National Historical Park" to get the dest_id. Then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival date November 15, departure November 18 (three-day stay), and other parameters like sort_by, price filters if needed.

For the taxi, need pick-up place as the airport (Philadelphia) and drop-off as the hotel. But first, need the hotel's location. Wait, after booking the hotel, we'll have its address, but maybe the Search_Hotels response includes place IDs. Alternatively, use Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel's address to get the googlePlaceId. But the user says "from the airport to the hotel," so pick_up_place_id is the airport's googlePlaceId, which might come from Search_Flight_Location. Wait, Search_Flight_Location gives airport IDs, but Taxi_Search_Location uses googlePlaceId. Hmm, maybe the airport's googlePlaceId can be found via Taxi_Search_Location with the airport name.

Wait, the user says "one hour after the flight lands," so need the flight's arrival time to set the taxi pick-up time. But first, need to get the flight details to know the arrival time. So the steps are interdependent.

Let me outline the order:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Denver and Philadelphia to get fromId and toId.
2. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-15, sort=CHEAPEST. Then check the results for flights without overnight layovers. But the user says "don't accept flights with overnight layovers," which probably means layovers longer than a certain time, but the API might not have a filter for that. So maybe after getting the flight options, select the cheapest one that meets the layover condition. However, the assistant can't process the response, so the function call must include parameters that ensure no overnight layovers. Wait, the Search_Flights parameters don't have a layover filter. So perhaps the user's constraint is something the assistant has to handle after getting the data, but since the assistant can only make function calls, maybe the initial call is just for cheapest flights, and the user's constraint is noted but not directly handled by the API. So proceed with the cheapest flight search.

3. Once flight is booked, get arrival time, then set taxi pick-up time as arrival time + 1 hour.

4. For the hotel, Search_Hotel_Destination for "Independence National Historical Park" to get dest_id, then Search_Hotels with arrival_date=2024-11-15, departure_date=2024-11-18, dest_id from previous step.

5. For taxi, need pick_up_place_id (Philadelphia airport's googlePlaceId) and drop_off_place_id (hotel's googlePlaceId). To get these, use Taxi_Search_Location for the airport name and hotel address.

But the user hasn't provided the hotel name yet, so after booking the hotel, we'd have its address, but since we're in the planning phase, maybe the Search_Hotels response includes place IDs. Alternatively, the assistant needs to first get the hotel's location via Search_Hotels, then use that to get the googlePlaceId for the taxi.

This is getting complex. Let's structure the function calls step by step.

First, handle the flight:

- Call Search_Flight_Location for "Denver" to get fromId.
- Call Search_Flight_Location for "Philadelphia" to get toId.
- Then call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-15, sort=CHEAPEST.

But the user said "cheapest flight," so sort=CHEAPEST. The parameters for Search_Flights require toId, fromId, departDate. So need the location IDs first.

Next, hotel:

- Call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Independence National Historical Park" to get dest_id.
- Then call Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date=2024-11-15, departure_date=2024-11-18 (three days: 15th to 18th is three nights, but the user says three-day stay, so maybe arrival 15th, departure 18th).

Taxi:

- After knowing flight arrival time, set pick_up_time as arrival time + 1 hour.
- Need pick_up_place_id (Philadelphia airport) and drop_off_place_id (hotel location).
- So call Taxi_Search_Location for "Philadelphia International Airport" to get googlePlaceId for pick-up.
- For drop-off, after hotel is selected, use its address in Taxi_Search_Location.

But since the user hasn't booked the hotel yet, the assistant would need to first get hotel options, then select one, then get its place ID. However, the function calls are sequential.

So the initial steps are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Denver.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Philadelphia.
3. Search_Flights with the obtained IDs, sort=CHEAPEST, departDate=2024-11-15.
4. Search_Hotel_Destination for Independence National Historical Park.
5. Search_Hotels with the dest_id from step 4, dates 2024-11-15 to 2024-11-18.
6. Once flight and hotel are known, get their place IDs for taxi.

But the user's request is to book all, so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls to gather all required info.

Wait, the user says "book the cheapest flight", "book a hotel", "need a taxi". So the assistant needs to call the search functions to get the necessary parameters for booking, but the actual booking might be a separate step. However, the provided tools are for searching, not booking. The functions available are search functions, so the assistant's job is to gather the required data to proceed with booking.

So the first step is to get the flight details, then hotel, then taxi.

Let me check the required parameters for each function.

For Search_Flights:

- toId, fromId, departDate are required.
- sort can be CHEAPEST.

So need to get toId and fromId via Search_Flight_Location.

Similarly, for Search_Hotels:

- search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date are required.

search_type comes from Search_Hotel_Destination? Wait, the description says "search_type can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination". So first call Search_Hotel_Destination with query to get dest_id and possibly search_type.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function returns latitude and longitude, but the required parameter for Search_Hotels is dest_id, which is a number. The description says "dest_id can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination".

So steps for hotel:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Independence National Historical Park" to get dest_id.
2. Use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

Similarly, for flights:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Denver" to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Philadelphia" to get toId.
3. Call Search_Flights with those IDs.

For taxi:

Need pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id, which come from Taxi_Search_Location.

So first, get Philadelphia airport's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location with "Philadelphia International Airport".

Then, after hotel is selected, get its googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location with the hotel's address.

But the user hasn't specified the hotel yet, so the assistant would need to first get hotel options, then select one, then get its place ID.

But since the user's instruction is to book a hotel near the park, the assistant would call Search_Hotels to find options, then presumably select one, but the function calls here are just for searching.

So the immediate next steps are to call the location search functions to get the necessary IDs.

Let's structure the tool calls:

First, for flights:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Denver"
- Search_Flight_Location with query "Philadelphia"

Then, Search_Flights with the obtained IDs, sort=CHEAPEST, departDate=2024-11-15.

For hotel:

- Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Independence National Historical Park"
- Then Search_Hotels with the dest_id from above, arrival_date=2024-11-15, departure_date=2024-11-
