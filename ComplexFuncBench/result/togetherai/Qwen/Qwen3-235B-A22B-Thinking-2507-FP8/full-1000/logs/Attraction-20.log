2025-08-13 22:03:42,534 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about the Stone Forest after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Stone Forest" as the query. The response gave three products, but the first one is in Kunming, China, which is the famous Stone Forest UNESCO site. The other two are in Arequipa, Peru, and Lanzhou, China. Since the user mentioned it's on social media and "dope," they're probably referring to the well-known one in Kunming.

So I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the first product. The response has detailed info. Now I need to present this to the user. Let me check the key points: it's a UNESCO site, part of Naigu Stone Forest, less touristy than the main areas, includes a village visit, lunch, and transportation. The price is around $105.55 USD, free cancellation, but there's a negative review. Also, requirements like minimum 2 people, wheelchair accessible, etc.

The user wants detailed info, so I should summarize the main attractions, what's included, price, location, and mention the review. Make sure to highlight the unique aspects like UNESCO, the village, and the less crowded area. Also note the practical details like booking requirements and what's not included. Avoid technical jargon, keep it conversational. Let me structure this clearly.
