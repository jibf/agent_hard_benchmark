Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Resivation Hotel in Dubai with hotel_id 7181225. I first called Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By and got Dubai Sports City as the closest landmark. Then I used Search_Attraction_Location with "Dubai Sports City" to find the specific attraction, which gave me the productSlug for the Private Water Sports Activity. Finally, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to get the detailed info.

Now, I need to present this information clearly. The user wants recommendations and detailed descriptions. The main attraction found is the Private Water Sports Activity in Dubai Adventure Zone. I should summarize the key points from the data: description, what's included, price, cancellation policy, and any important notes like age restrictions or requirements. Also, mention that it's near the hotel, about 4.17 km away. Make sure to highlight the highlights like the Seakart experience, views of Burj Al Arab, and the inclusions. Check if there are other attractions, but the response only had one, so focus on that. Avoid technical jargon, keep it user-friendly. Double-check the details to ensure accuracy, like the price in USD and the free cancellation policy. Also, note the additional info about not recommended for certain health conditions and the need for ID. Make sure the answer is structured so it's easy to read, maybe bullet points for inclusions and important notes.
