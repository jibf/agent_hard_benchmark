Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want to book the fastest flight from Quebec to New York on October 5, 2024, with no overnight layovers. Then, they need a hotel near Central Park for two weeks. Finally, a taxi from the airport to the hotel one hour after landing.

Starting with the flight. The user specified "fastest," so I need to use the Search_Flights function with sort set to FASTEST. The departure date is October 5, 2024. But I need the fromId and toId for Quebec and New York airports. Wait, the user mentioned Quebec, which is a city in Canada, so the departure airport is probably Quebec City Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB). New York has several airports like JFK, LGA, EWR. But the user didn't specify which one, so maybe I need to search for the correct airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Quebec" to get the fromId. Then another call for "New York" to get the toId. Once I have those IDs, I can use Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST, departDate=2024-10-05, fromId and toId. Also, the user doesn't want overnight layovers, but the API parameters don't mention layovers. Maybe the FASTEST sort will prioritize direct flights or shortest total time, which might avoid long layovers. Not sure, but the user's constraint might be handled by the sort parameter.

Next, the hotel near Central Park. Need to use Search_Hotels. First, get the dest_id for New York using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Central Park, New York". Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function takes a location query. So query "Central Park, New York" to get the dest_id. Then use Search_Hotels with arrival_date as the flight arrival date, departure_date two weeks later. But wait, the flight arrival date depends on the flight's arrival time. However, the user says the taxi is one hour after landing, so maybe the hotel check-in is the same day as arrival. But the user says a two-week stay, so arrival_date would be the flight arrival date, departure_date 14 days later. But first, need to know the flight's arrival time to set the hotel dates. However, the flight search hasn't been done yet, so maybe the hotel dates are based on the departure date plus flight duration. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the assistant should first get the flight details, then use the arrival time to set the hotel dates. But since the user hasn't provided flight details yet, perhaps the hotel search can be done with the departure date plus an estimated arrival time. Wait, the user says "book a hotel near Central Park in New York for a two-week stay." The stay starts when they arrive, which is after the flight lands. So the arrival_date for the hotel would be the date the flight arrives, which is October 5 if the flight is same-day, but if the flight arrives on October 6 due to time zones, it might be different. However, the user specified October 5 as the departure date, so assuming the flight arrives on the same day. But time zones might affect this. Maybe the assistant should proceed by first getting the flight details to know the exact arrival time and date, then set the hotel dates accordingly. But since the user hasn't provided flight info yet, the assistant needs to first search for flights, then use that info for the hotel and taxi.

But the user's request is to book all three: flight, hotel, taxi. So the assistant needs to chain the function calls. First, get the airport IDs for Quebec and New York using Search_Flight_Location. Then search for the fastest flight. Once the flight is found, get its arrival time to determine the taxi pickup time (one hour after landing). Then search for a hotel near Central Park, using the arrival date as the flight arrival date, and departure date 14 days later.

So step 1: Search_Flight_Location for "Quebec" to get fromId.

Step 2: Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get toId.

Step 3: Use Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST, departDate=2024-10-05, fromId and toId.

Once flight is booked, get arrival time. Suppose the flight arrives at, say, 15:00 on Oct 5. Then taxi pickup time is 16:00 on Oct 5.

For the hotel, need to search near Central Park. So use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Central Park, New York" to get dest_id. Then Search_Hotels with arrival_date=2024-10-05, departure_date=2024-10-19 (14 days later), dest_id from previous step.

Then for the taxi, need pick_up_place_id as the airport's googlePlaceId (from Search_Taxi's searchLocation for the New York airport), drop_off_place_id as the hotel's location. But the hotel's exact address isn't known yet, so maybe after hotel search, get the hotel's location to use as drop-off.

Wait, the user says "book a taxi to take me from the airport to the hotel". So pick-up is the airport (New York's airport), drop-off is the hotel. But to get the googlePlaceId for the airport, need to use Taxi_Search_Location for the airport name. Similarly, the hotel's location would need to be converted to a googlePlaceId.

So steps:

After getting the flight's toId (which is the airport code, like JFK), use Taxi_Search_Location with query "JFK Airport" to get drop_off_place_id? Wait, no: the taxi is from airport to hotel, so pick_up_place_id is the airport, drop_off_place_id is the hotel.

Wait, Taxi_Search_Location is for finding googlePlaceId of locations. So for the airport, query "New York JFK Airport" to get its googlePlaceId as pick_up_place_id. For the hotel, after finding the hotel, get its address and use Taxi_Search_Location on that address to get drop_off_place_id.

But the user hasn't specified the hotel yet, so the assistant needs to first find the hotel, then get its location.

This is getting complex. The assistant needs to make multiple sequential calls.

But according to the problem, the assistant should call the necessary functions in the correct order. Let's outline the required function calls:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Quebec" to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get toId.
3. Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST, departDate=2024-10-05, fromId, toId.
   - Assuming this returns flight details including arrival time.
4. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Central Park, New York" to get dest_id.
5. Search_Hotels with arrival_date=flight arrival date, departure_date=arrival_date +14 days, dest_id.
6. For the taxi:
   a. Taxi_Search_Location for the arrival airport (e.g., "JFK Airport") to get pick_up_place_id.
   b. Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel's address (from step 5) to get drop_off_place_id.
   c. Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id, drop_off_place_id, pick_up_time=arrival_time +1 hour, pick_up_date=arrival_date.

But the user hasn't provided specific airport names, so the assistant has to infer. For example, Quebec's main airport is YQB, New York's airports are JFK, LGA, EWR. The Search_Flight_Location will return the correct IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Quebec" and "New York" to get the IDs.

Then proceed with Search_Flights.

Then for the hotel, Search_Hotel_Destination for "Central Park, New York".

Then Search_Hotels.

Then for taxi, need to get the airport's googlePlaceId (using Taxi_Search_Location on the airport name obtained from flight search), and the hotel's location.

But the problem is that the assistant can't know the exact airport or hotel address until the previous steps are done. So the initial tool calls should be the location searches to get the necessary IDs.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for Quebec and New York.

Wait, the user said "from Quebec to New York", so Quebec is the departure city, New York the arrival city.

So first tool calls:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Quebec" to get fromId.
- Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get toId.

Then use those IDs in Search_Flights.

Similarly, for the hotel, Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Central Park, New York" to get dest_id.

Then Search_Hotels with that dest_id.

For the taxi, need to get the airport's googlePlaceId (using Taxi_Search_Location on the airport name, which would be part of the flight search result), but since we don't have that yet, maybe first get the flight, then get the airport's Place ID.

But the assistant has to make the calls step by step. Since the user's request is to book all three, the assistant needs to initiate the process by getting the necessary location IDs first.

So the first tool calls should be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Quebec"
2. Search_Flight_Location for "New York"
3. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Central Park, New York"
