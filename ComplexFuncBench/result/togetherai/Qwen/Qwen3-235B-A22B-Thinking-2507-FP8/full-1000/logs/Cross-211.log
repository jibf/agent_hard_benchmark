2025-08-13 20:04:52,457 - evaluation_logger_Cross-211 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from Boston on December 15, 2024, going to Philadelphia and Washington, then returning to Boston. I'm expecting to stay in each city for seven days. My address is 800 Boylston St in Boston. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want the cheapest connecting flight from Boston on Dec 15, 2024, going to Philadelphia and Washington, then returning to Boston. They'll stay 7 days in each city. Also, need taxi bookings to and from the airport.

First, I need to handle the flight search. The user mentioned a multi-stop flight: Boston -> Philadelphia -> Washington -> Boston. Wait, the return is to Boston, so the legs would be Boston to Philadelphia, Philadelphia to Washington, then Washington back to Boston. But the user said "returning to Boston," so maybe it's a round trip with two stops. Wait, the user says "leaving from Boston on December 15, 2024, going to Philadelphia and Washington, then returning to Boston." So the outbound is Boston -> Philadelphia -> Washington, and the return is Washington -> Boston? Or maybe it's a multi-city trip with three legs: Boston to Philly, Philly to DC, then DC back to Boston. But the user says "returning to Boston," so the return leg is from DC to Boston.

Wait, the user says "going to Philadelphia and Washington, then returning to Boston." So the itinerary is Boston -> Philadelphia (7 days) -> Washington (7 days) -> Boston. So the flight legs would be:

1. Boston (BOS) to Philadelphia (PHL) on Dec 15, 2024
2. Philadelphia (PHL) to Washington (DCA or IAD) 7 days later, so Dec 22
3. Washington to Boston 7 days after that, so Dec 29

But the user says "returning to Boston," so the third leg is the return. So the legs array should have three entries? Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires legs as an array of fromId, toId, date. So for a multi-city trip with two stops (three legs), the legs would be:

- Leg 1: BOS to PHL on 2024-12-15
- Leg 2: PHL to WAS (DCA/IAD) on 2024-12-22
- Leg 3: WAS to BOS on 2024-12-29

But the user said "returning to Boston," so maybe it's a round trip with two stops, but the function is for multi-stops, so legs would be the three segments.

First, I need to get the airport codes for Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. So I need to use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

For Boston: query "Boston" to get BOS airport ID.
Philadelphia: query "Philadelphia" to get PHL.
Washington: query "Washington" to get DCA or IAD, but probably DCA is closer.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the correct airport IDs.

Then, construct the legs array with the dates. The user is leaving Boston on Dec 15, so first leg date is 2024-12-15. Then staying 7 days in Philly, so next leg on Dec 22. Then 7 days in DC, so return on Dec 29.

Next, the taxi part. The user's address is 800 Boylston St in Boston. Need to book a taxi to the airport three hours before the flight. So first, need to know the flight departure time from Boston on Dec 15. But the flight search hasn't been done yet, so maybe the taxi booking depends on the flight time. However, the user is asking to book the taxi in advance, so perhaps the flight time is not known yet. Wait, the user says "Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off..." So the taxi booking requires the flight departure time, which we don't have until we search for flights. But the user is asking to do both: find the flight and book the taxi. So maybe first, we need to find the flight, get the departure time, then book the taxi. But since the user is asking to do it all, the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then use that info for the taxi.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the flight times yet, so the assistant can't know the exact time to book the taxi. However, the user is asking to book the taxi three hours before the flight, so the assistant needs to first find the flight, then use its departure time to schedule the taxi.

But in the current step, the assistant is supposed to make tool calls based on the user's request. The user hasn't provided flight times, so the assistant needs to first search for flights, which will give the departure time, then use that to book the taxi.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington to get their airport IDs.

Wait, the user's address is 800 Boylston St in Boston, which is for the taxi pickup. So for the taxi, need to get the googlePlaceId for 800 Boylston St, Boston, and the airport's googlePlaceId.

So steps:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Boston to get BOS ID.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Philadelphia to get PHL ID.
3. Search_Flight_Location for Washington to get DCA/IAD ID.
4. Use those IDs to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: BOS->PHL on 12-15, PHL->WAS on 12-22, WAS->BOS on 12-29, sort by CHEAPEST.
5. Once flight times are known, especially departure time from Boston on 12-15, calculate taxi pickup time (3 hours before), then:
   a. Use Taxi_Search_Location for 800 Boylston St, Boston to get pickup place ID.
   b. Use Taxi_Search_Location for the airport (BOS) to get drop-off place ID (but for the outbound taxi, pickup is home, drop-off is airport; for return, pickup is airport, drop-off is home).
   c. Call Search_Taxi for outbound: pickup home, drop-off airport, date and time 3 hours before flight.
   d. Similarly, for return, after the flight lands, book taxi from airport to home, 1 hour after landing.

But the user's request is to "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands."

So first, need the flight departure time from Boston (outbound) and arrival time in Boston (return).

But since the flight search hasn't been done yet, the assistant can't know the exact times. Therefore, the first step is to perform the flight search to get the flight details, including departure and arrival times.

Therefore, the initial tool calls should be:

- Search_Flight_Location for Boston, Philadelphia, Washington to get airport IDs.
- Then Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs and dates.
- Once flight data is obtained, extract departure time from Boston, calculate taxi time, then do Taxi_Search_Location for home address and airport, then Search_Taxi.

But in the current step, the assistant is to make the necessary tool calls based on the user's query. Since the user hasn't provided airport codes or flight times, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, the user mentioned "My address is 800 Boylston St in Boston." So for the taxi pickup, need to search for that address to get the googlePlaceId.

So the tool calls needed in order:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Boston" to get BOS airport ID.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Philadelphia" to get PHL.
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Washington" to get the correct airport (DCA or IAD).
4. Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs using those IDs and dates.
5. Taxi_Search_Location for "800 Boylston St, Boston" to get pickup place ID.
6. Taxi_Search_Location for the Boston airport (from step 1) to get drop-off place ID for outbound taxi.
7. Similarly, for the return, but that would depend on the flight arrival time.

But the user is asking to book both the outbound and return taxis. However, the return taxi is after the returning flight lands, which would be after the last leg (WAS to BOS). So need the arrival time of the return flight to schedule the taxi 1 hour after.

But since the flight search hasn't been done, the assistant can't know the arrival time yet. Therefore, the first step is to get the flight details, then proceed.

But the user's query is a single request, so the assistant needs to make the necessary tool calls to fulfill the request. Since the flight details are unknown, the first tool calls should be the Search_Flight_Location for the cities to get the airport IDs, then Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

Wait, the user said "cheapest connecting flight", so sort by CHEAPEST.

So the plan is:

- Call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get airport IDs.
- Use those IDs to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs array for the three segments, dates as calculated, sort: CHEAPEST.
- Then, once flight times are known, call Taxi_Search_Location for home address and airports, then Search_Taxi for both trips.

But in the current step, the assistant is to make the tool calls as per the user's
