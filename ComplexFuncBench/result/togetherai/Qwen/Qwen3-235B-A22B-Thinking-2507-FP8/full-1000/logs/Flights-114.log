Okay, let's tackle this user query. So, the user's friend wants to fly from Wuhan to Philadelphia with a layover in Kuala Lumpur around November 10, 2024. They need the cheapest multi-stop flight dates and the seat map, but no overnight layovers.

First, I need to figure out the correct airports. The user mentioned Wuhan, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the airport ID for Wuhan. Same for Kuala Lumpur and Philadelphia. Let me check the tools available. The Search_Flight_Location function takes a query parameter, so I'll call that for each city.

Wait, the user said "depart from Wuhan to Philadelphia around November 10" with a layover in Kuala Lumpur. So the legs would be Wuhan -> Kuala Lumpur -> Philadelphia. Each leg needs fromId, toId, and date. But the dates for the legs might be different. The main date is around November 10, but since it's a multi-stop, the first leg is November 10, and the second leg would be the next day, but the user doesn't want overnight layovers. So the layover should be less than 24 hours. So maybe the second leg is the same day or next day, but not overnight. Wait, overnight layover probably means the layover is more than a certain number of hours, like 12 or 24. The user says "doesn't accept flights with overnight layovers," so the layover time should be within the same day or a short connection.

But first, I need the airport codes. Let me call Search_Flight_Location for Wuhan, Kuala Lumpur, and Philadelphia.

Starting with Wuhan. Query "Wuhan" to get the airport ID. Then Kuala Lumpur, then Philadelphia. Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs for the multi-stop search.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function requires legs as an array of fromId, toId, date. But the user wants the cheapest flight around November 10. The function description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So maybe the date for the first leg is November 10, and the API will check dates from Nov 5 to Nov 15.

But the legs array needs to have each segment. So first leg: Wuhan to Kuala Lumpur on Nov 10 (or around that date), second leg: Kuala Lumpur to Philadelphia on the same or next day, but no overnight. So the second leg's date would be the same as the first leg's arrival date, but since it's a layover, the departure from KL should be the same day as arrival from Wuhan, or next day but not overnight. Wait, if the flight from Wuhan arrives in KL in the evening, and the next flight is the next morning, that's an overnight layover, which is not allowed. So the layover must be within the same day.

But the exact dates for the legs might depend on the flight schedules. However, the user is asking for the departure dates of the cheapest flight. So maybe the first leg's date is around Nov 10, and the second leg's date is the same or next day, but the API will handle the possible dates.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's parameters require legs as an array. Each leg has a date. But for multi-stop, the second leg's date would be after the first leg's date. However, the user says "around November 10", so maybe the first leg is on Nov 10, and the second leg is on Nov 10 or 11, but ensuring the layover isn't overnight.

But the function might need specific dates for each leg. However, the description says the API returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So perhaps the date provided in the legs is the intended date, and the API checks the window around it.

Wait, the user says "depart from Wuhan to Philadelphia around November 10", so the departure from Wuhan is around Nov 10. The layover in KL, then to Philadelphia. So the first leg's date is around Nov 10, the second leg's date would be the same or next day.

But to use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, I need to specify the legs with dates. However, since the user wants the cheapest around that date, maybe the date for the first leg is Nov 10, and the API will check 5 days before and after. But the legs array requires a date for each leg. Wait, the example in the parameters shows legs as an array with date for each leg. So for a two-leg trip (Wuhan-KL-Philly), legs would be [ {fromId: Wuhan, toId: KL, date: '2024-11-10'}, {fromId: KL, toId: Philly, date: '2024-11-10'} ] but the second date might need to be after the first. However, the actual date for the second leg depends on the flight schedule. But the API might handle the possible dates.

Wait, the function description says "the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date". So perhaps the date provided in the legs is the target date, and the API checks the window. But for multi-stop, each leg's date might be adjusted. Hmm, this is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is more appropriate here because it allows searching for multi-stop flights with specific legs and dates, and then we can sort by cheapest. But the user wants the minimum price, so Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might be the right function.

Wait, the user says "Look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight". So they need the dates when the cheapest flight is available around Nov 10. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the minimum price, which would include the dates.

But first, I need the airport IDs. So step 1: call Search_Flight_Location for Wuhan, Kuala Lumpur, and Philadelphia to get their IDs.

Let me start with Wuhan. Query "Wuhan" to get the airport ID. Then same for KL and Philly.

Once I have the IDs, construct the legs array for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. The legs would be:

[
  { fromId: 'WUH.AIRPORT', toId: 'KUL.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-10' },
  { fromId: 'KUL.AIRPORT', toId: 'PHL.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-10' }
]

Wait, but the second leg's date should be after the first leg's date. However, since it's a layover, the second leg's date might be the same day or next day. But the user doesn't want overnight layovers, so the second leg should depart on the same day as the first leg arrives. So if the first leg arrives on Nov 10, the second leg departs on Nov 10. But depending on flight times, maybe it's the next day, but not overnight. Wait, overnight layover would mean staying overnight, so if the layover is less than, say, 12 hours, it's not overnight. But the user's constraint is no overnight layovers, so the connection must be same-day.

Therefore, the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's date. But in reality, if the first flight arrives late, the next flight might be the next day, but the user doesn't want that. So the API should return flights where the layover is within the same day.

But for the purpose of the function call, the dates for both legs might be set to '2024-11-10', and the API will handle the possible connections within that date window.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if we set the date as '2024-11-10' for both legs, the API will check from Nov 5 to Nov 15 for the first leg, and the second leg's date would be adjusted accordingly.

But the legs array requires a date for each leg. Maybe for multi-stop, the second leg's date is not specified, but the function requires it. Hmm, the example in the parameters shows multiple legs with dates, so for two stops, two leg objects.

Wait, the user's trip is Wuhan -> KL -> Philadelphia, so two legs. Each leg needs a date. But the second leg's date depends on the first leg's arrival. However, the function might require specifying a date for each leg, perhaps the intended departure date for each segment.

But the user says "depart from Wuhan... around November 10", so the first leg's date is around Nov 10, and the second leg's date would be the next day or same day. But to avoid overnight layovers, the second leg should depart on the same day as the first leg arrives. So if the first leg departs Wuhan on Nov 10 and arrives KL on Nov 10, the second leg departs KL on Nov 10.

Therefore, both legs would have the date '2024-11-10'. But the API might handle the actual dates within the 5-day window.

So first, get the airport IDs:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Wuhan"
2.
