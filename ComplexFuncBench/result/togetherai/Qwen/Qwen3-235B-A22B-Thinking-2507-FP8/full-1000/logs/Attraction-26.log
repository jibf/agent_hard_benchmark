2025-08-13 22:04:41,828 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-26 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about the Forbidden City after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Forbidden City" as the query. That gave me the productSlug, which I then used in Get_Attraction_Details.

Now, looking at the response from Get_Attraction_Details, there's a lot of info here. The user probably wants a concise summary. Let me break it down.

First, the name is "Forbidden City Ticket" operated by Authentic China Tours. The description mentions it's a UNESCO site, pre-booking saves time, and you can explore at your own pace. The price is $9.90 USD. Important points: need passport, not wheelchair accessible, some health restrictions, and free cancellation.

The user said it's "dope" on social media, so they might be interested in highlights and practical info for visiting. They might not care about all the technical details like IDs or specific policies unless they're planning a trip.

I should structure the response with key details: overview, highlights, practical info (price, booking, requirements), accessibility, cancellation, and maybe some review stats. Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and informative. Mention the high rating (4.9/5) from 42 reviews to build trust.

Check if there's anything missing. The user didn't ask for hotels, so no need for payment features or policies. Focus on the attraction details. Make sure to note the need for passport and the exclusions like no tour guide. Also, the health warnings might be important for some travelers.

Double-check the data from the tool response to ensure accuracy. For example, the price is $9.90, free cancellation, operated by Authentic China Tours. Include the main inclusions and exclusions. Maybe mention the reviews' positive comments about the experience despite some challenges with the audio guide.

Alright, time to put it all together in a clear, engaging way that answers the user's request for more detailed info.
