Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user's friend wants to travel from Shenzhen to Miami with a layover in Dubai around December 10, 2024. They need the cheapest multi-stop flight without overnight layovers and the seat map.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey is Shenzhen -> Dubai -> Miami. So two legs: first from Shenzhen to Dubai, then Dubai to Miami. The date given is around December 10, but since it's a multi-stop, the first leg's date is December 10, and the second leg would be the next day, but the user says no overnight layovers. Wait, "overnight layovers" probably means the layover shouldn't span a night, so the connection should be on the same day. But Dubai to Miami might take a long time. Wait, maybe the user means the layover in Dubai shouldn't be overnight, so the second flight should depart Dubai on the same day as arrival from Shenzhen.

But the user says "around December 10", so maybe the departure from Shenzhen is December 10, then the layover in Dubai is same day, then to Miami. But need to check the dates.

First step: get the location IDs for Shenzhen, Dubai, and Miami airports. The user mentioned using Search_Flight_Location to get the fromId and toId.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Shenzhen. The query parameter would be "Shenzhen". Similarly for Dubai and Miami.

Wait, the user says "depart from Shenzhen to Miami around December 10, 2024, with a layover in Dubai". So legs are:

Leg 1: Shenzhen (fromId) to Dubai (toId) on date Dec 10.

Leg 2: Dubai (fromId) to Miami (toId) on date Dec 10 or 11? But no overnight layovers, so the second leg should depart on the same day as arrival from first leg. So if the first flight arrives in Dubai on Dec 10, the second flight must also depart on Dec 10. So both legs have the same date? But that might not be possible depending on flight times. However, the user says "around December 10", so maybe the first leg is Dec 10, and the second leg is Dec 10 or 11, but no overnight, so same day.

But the problem is the user wants the cheapest multi-stop flight, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function can help find the cheapest dates around Dec 10. Wait, the user says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight". So they need to find the cheapest dates within a window around Dec 10.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user specifies the date as Dec 10, the API will check from Dec 5 to Dec 15.

But first, need to get the location IDs.

So step 1: Use Search_Flight_Location for Shenzhen, Dubai, Miami to get their IDs.

For example:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Shenzhen" to get Shenzhen airport ID (maybe SZX.AIRPORT)
- Similarly for Dubai (DXB.AIRPORT) and Miami (MIA.AIRPORT)

Once we have the IDs, we can structure the legs for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

The legs array would be:

[
  { "fromId": "SZX.AIRPORT", "toId": "DXB.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-10" },
  { "fromId": "DXB.AIRPORT", "toId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-10" }
]

But since the user says "around December 10", maybe the date for the first leg is Dec 10, and the second leg's date is the same or next day, but no overnight. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So perhaps the date parameter in legs is the intended date, and the API checks around that.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's parameters: legs array includes date for each leg. But the description says "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." So for each leg's date, it checks Â±5 days.

But the user wants the cheapest multi-stop flight around Dec 10. So maybe set the legs' dates to Dec 10, and the API will check from Dec 5 to Dec 15 for each leg.

But the user also specifies no overnight layovers. So the layover in Dubai must be on the same day. So the arrival in Dubai from Shenzhen must be on the same day as departure to Miami. So the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's arrival date.

But flight durations: Shenzhen to Dubai is about 8 hours, Dubai to Miami is about 16 hours. So if the first flight departs Shenzhen on Dec 10 morning, arrives Dubai Dec 10 evening, then the next flight to Miami would depart Dubai Dec 10 evening, arriving Miami Dec 11. But the layover is same day, so no overnight. Wait, "overnight layover" probably means the layover spans a night, i.e., the connection is on the next day. So if the first flight arrives Dubai at 10 PM Dec 10, and the next flight departs at 1 AM Dec 11, that's an overnight layover. The user doesn't accept that. So the second flight must depart Dubai on the same calendar day as arrival from Shenzhen.

Therefore, the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's date. So both legs have date 2024-12-10.

But depending on time zones, maybe the arrival in Dubai is Dec 10, and departure to Miami is Dec 10 same day.

So the legs would have the same date.

Therefore, to find the cheapest flights, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs on Dec 10.

But first, need the location IDs.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location for Shenzhen, Dubai, Miami.

Wait, the user says "depart from Shenzhen to Miami around December 10, 2024, with a layover in Dubai". So three locations: Shenzhen (origin), Dubai (layover), Miami (destination).

So first, call Search_Flight_Location three times:

1. Query: "Shenzhen" to get fromId for first leg.
2. Query: "Dubai" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.
3. Query: "Miami" to get toId for second leg.

Once we have those IDs, we can structure the legs for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

Assuming the IDs are SZX.AIRPORT, DXB.AIRPORT, MIA.AIRPORT.

Then, call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs:

[
  {"fromId": "SZX.AIRPORT", "toId": "DXB.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-10"},
  {"fromId": "DXB.AIRPORT", "toId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-10"}
]

This will get the minimum price for flights around Dec 10, considering 5 days before and after.

But the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight. So the API response should include the actual dates of the cheapest flights found.

Once we have the cheapest flight details, including the offerToken, then we can call Get_Seat_Map with that offerToken.

But the user also says "he doesn't accept flights with overnight layovers". So after getting the flight options, we need to filter out those with overnight layovers. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not provide layover duration details. So perhaps after getting the flight options via Search_Flights_Multi_Stops (which might have more details), we can check the layover times.

Wait, the user's main request is to "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map for the flight."

So steps:

1. Find location IDs for Shenzhen, Dubai, Miami using Search_Flight_Location.

2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates around Dec 10.

But Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the minimum price, but maybe not the specific flight details. Alternatively, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with sort=CHEAPEST to get the cheapest flight, then check layover times.

Wait, the user says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight". So they need the actual dates (maybe the specific dates that are cheapest within the window).

Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is designed for that: it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after, so it would give the dates with the cheapest prices.

But to get the seat map, we need the offerToken from a specific flight search.

So perhaps:

- First, get location IDs.

- Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates.

- Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the flight details, including offerToken.
