I need to book the cheapest flights for this multi-stop trip. I plan to stay at the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, can you check whether the hotel is available on those dates? Don't forget to arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Los Angeles airport on the 7th.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight: New York to Los Angeles on November 5, 2024, then Los Angeles to Tokyo two days later, which would be November 7. They want the cheapest flights.

So, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. But before that, I have to get the airport IDs for New York, Los Angeles, and Tokyo. The user mentioned specific cities, so I should call Search_Flight_Location for each city to find the correct airport IDs.

Wait, the first leg is New York to Los Angeles. Let me check the airports. New York has several airports like JFK, LGA, EWR. The user didn't specify, so maybe the function will return the main ones. Similarly, Los Angeles has LAX, and Tokyo has HND or NRT. But the user said "Los Angeles airport" for the hotel, which is Hyatt Regency LA International Airport, so that's LAX.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get the correct fromId for the first leg. Then "Los Angeles" for the toId of the first leg and fromId of the second leg. Then "Tokyo" for the toId of the second leg.

Once I have those IDs, I can structure the legs array for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with dates: first leg date is 2024-11-05, second leg is 2024-11-07. Sort by CHEAPEST.

Next, the hotel part. They want to stay at Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport. Need to check availability from Nov 5 to Nov 7. Wait, arrival date would be Nov 5, departure Nov 7. But the hotel is in LA, so the stay is from Nov 5 to Nov 7. To check availability, need the hotel_id. So first, search for the hotel using Search_Hotels. But to do that, need dest_id for Los Angeles. So call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Los Angeles" to get dest_id. Then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels to find Hyatt Regency, get its hotel_id. Then call Get_Room_List_With_Availability with hotel_id, arrival_date 2024-11-05, departure_date 2024-11-07.

Then, taxi arrangement: pick up from hotel three hours before flight on 7th. The flight from LA to Tokyo is on Nov 7, so need to know the flight time to set pick-up time. But the user didn't specify flight time, so maybe the taxi pick-up time is three hours before the flight departure. However, since the flight details aren't known yet (as we're searching for cheapest flights), maybe the taxi time is based on the flight's departure time once booked. But the user says "three hours before my flight", so perhaps we need to assume a time or maybe the taxi booking requires a specific time. Wait, the user says "arrange for a taxi to pick me up from the hotel three hours before my flight and take me to the Los Angeles airport on the 7th." So the pick-up date is Nov 7, time is three hours before the flight. But without knowing the flight time, how to set the pick-up time? Maybe the flight time will be determined after booking the flights, but the user wants to arrange the taxi now. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the taxi booking can be done once the flight time is known, but since the user is asking to arrange it now, perhaps we need to proceed with the taxi search using the hotel's location as pick-up and LAX as drop-off, but the time would depend on the flight. However, the user might expect that after booking the flight, the taxi time is set accordingly. But since the current step is to check availability and book flights, maybe the taxi part requires the hotel's location and LAX's place ID.

So for the taxi, need pick_up_place_id (hotel's googlePlaceId) and drop_off_place_id (LAX's googlePlaceId). To get those, first call Taxi_Search_Location for "Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport" to get its googlePlaceId. Then call Taxi_Search_Location for "Los Angeles airport" to get LAX's googlePlaceId. Then, once we have the flight departure time from the multi-stop search, we can calculate the pick-up time as flight time minus 3 hours. But since the user hasn't booked the flight yet, maybe the taxi time is to be arranged after knowing the flight time. However, the user is asking to arrange it now, so perhaps the taxi booking requires the date (Nov 7) and a time, but without the flight time, we can't specify the exact time. Wait, the user says "three hours before my flight", so maybe the taxi time is dependent on the flight's departure time. Therefore, perhaps the taxi booking can't be completed until the flight is booked and the departure time is known. But the user is asking to arrange it now, so maybe the system will handle it once the flight is confirmed. However, for the purpose of this tool call, we need to get the place IDs for the hotel and LAX to prepare for the taxi search.

So steps:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get fromId for first leg.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Los Angeles" to get toId for first leg and fromId for second leg.
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Tokyo" to get toId for second leg.
4. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs array and sort by CHEAPEST.
5. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Los Angeles" to get dest_id.
6. Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-05, departure_date 2024-11-07, and search for Hyatt Regency to get hotel_id.
7. Get_Room_List_With_Availability using hotel_id and dates.
8. Taxi_Search_Location for "Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport" to get pick_up_place_id.
9. Taxi_Search_Location for "Los Angeles airport" to get drop_off_place_id.
10. Then, once flight time is known, calculate pick-up time and call Search_Taxi.

But the user hasn't provided flight times yet, so maybe the taxi time can't be set yet. However, the user is asking to arrange the taxi now, so perhaps the tool calls for the taxi locations are needed first, and the actual taxi search would require the time, which depends on the flight. But since the user says "three hours before my flight", maybe the flight time is part of the flight booking response, so after getting the flight details, we can compute the time. But for now, the immediate tool calls needed are the location searches for the airports, hotel destination, and taxi locations.

So the first set of tool calls should be:

- Search_Flight_Location for New York
- Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles
- Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo
- Search_Hotel_Destination for Los Angeles
- Taxi_Search_Location for Hyatt Regency LA International Airport
- Taxi_Search_Location for Los Angeles airport

Wait, but the user mentioned "Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport", so the exact name might be needed for the taxi search. Similarly, for the hotel search, need to find that specific hotel.

So let's structure the tool calls step by step.

First, for the flights:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the airport ID for departure.

Then Search_Flight_Location with "Los Angeles" for the first arrival and second departure.

Then Search_Flight_Location with "Tokyo" for the final destination.

Once those IDs are obtained, construct the legs array for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

For the hotel:

Call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Los Angeles" to get dest_id.

Then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels to find Hyatt Regency, but the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. Wait, the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So need to get search_type from Search_Hotel_Destination? Wait, the description says search_type can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination. So when we call Search_Hotel_Destination for Los Angeles, the response might include the search_type.

Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says: "This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." But the parameters for Search_Hotels require search_type, which is retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. So perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination response includes a search_type value.

Assuming that, after calling Search_Hotel_Destination for Los Angeles, we get a search_type, which is then used in Search_Hotels.

So steps:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination("Los Angeles") â†’ get dest_id and search_type.

2. Then Search_Hotels with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date=2024-11-05, departure_date=2024-11-07, and possibly other parameters to find Hyatt Regency.

But the user specifically mentions the hotel name, so maybe in Search_Hotels, there's a way to filter by name, but the parameters don't include a name field. The parameters for Search_Hotels include categories_filter, which might be used, but the user
