2025-08-13 22:03:54,754 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-22 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about Etihad Stadium after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Etihad Stadium" as the query. The response gave a list of products, and the first one was the 75-minute guided tour in Manchester. So I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug.

Now, the tool response has all the details. I need to present this info clearly. The user probably wants to know what the tour includes, price, location, and maybe how to book. Let me check the data.

The description mentions walking through the players' tunnel, press room, dressing rooms, etc. It's a 75-minute tour. Price is $39.03 USD. Free cancellation, operated by Klook. Location is Manchester. Also, accessibility info: wheelchair accessible. Restrictions say arrive 20 mins early.

I should structure this into key points: overview, highlights, practical info (price, duration, location), accessibility, cancellation policy. Make sure to mention it's for Manchester City FC's stadium to clarify which Etihad Stadium (since there's one in Abu Dhabi too, but the data shows Manchester). Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and informative. Check if all details from the tool response are covered. Maybe add a note about checking the latest info on the operator's site. Alright, that should cover what the user needs.
