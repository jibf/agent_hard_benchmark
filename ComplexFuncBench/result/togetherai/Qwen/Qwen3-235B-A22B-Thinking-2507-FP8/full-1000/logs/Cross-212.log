Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want the cheapest connecting flight from New Orleans on November 30, 2024, going to Atlanta and Memphis, then returning to New Orleans. They'll stay 12 days in each city. Also, they need a taxi booked to the airport 3 hours before departure and home 1 hour after return.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The user is leaving New Orleans on Nov 30, going to Atlanta, then Memphis, then back to New Orleans. Wait, the description says "leaving from New Orleans on November 30, 2024, going to Atlanta and Memphis, then returning to New Orleans." So the outbound journey is New Orleans -> Atlanta -> Memphis, and then return from Memphis to New Orleans? Or maybe New Orleans -> Atlanta, then Atlanta -> Memphis, then Memphis -> New Orleans? But the user mentions staying 12 days in each city. So maybe the trip is New Orleans to Atlanta (stay 12 days), then Atlanta to Memphis (another 12 days), then Memphis back to New Orleans. But the return flight would be from Memphis to New Orleans. Wait, the user says "returning to New Orleans," so the return leg is from the last city, which is Memphis.

But the user said "leaving from New Orleans on November 30, 2024, going to Atlanta and Memphis, then returning to New Orleans." So the outbound is New Orleans -> Atlanta -> Memphis, and the return is Memphis -> New Orleans. Wait, but connecting flights usually have multiple stops in one direction. Maybe it's a multi-city trip: New Orleans to Atlanta, then Atlanta to Memphis, then Memphis back to New Orleans. But the user says "returning to New Orleans," so the return leg is from Memphis.

Wait, the user says "cheapest connecting flight leaving from New Orleans on November 30, 2024, going to Atlanta and Memphis, then returning to New Orleans." So the outbound has two stops: Atlanta and Memphis, then return from Memphis to New Orleans. But connecting flights usually have multiple stops in one direction. Wait, maybe it's a round trip with multiple stops: New Orleans -> Atlanta -> Memphis -> New Orleans. But the user mentions staying 12 days in each city. So the dates would be:

- Depart New Orleans on Nov 30 to Atlanta (arrive same day or next day)
- Stay 12 days in Atlanta, so leave Atlanta around Dec 12 to Memphis
- Stay 12 days in Memphis, leave Memphis around Dec 24 back to New Orleans

But the user says "returning to New Orleans," so the return flight is from Memphis. So the legs would be:

1. New Orleans (MSY) to Atlanta (ATL) on Nov 30
2. Atlanta (ATL) to Memphis (MEM) on Dec 12
3. Memphis (MEM) to New Orleans (MSY) on Dec 24

But the user said "returning to New Orleans," so maybe the return is a single leg from Memphis. So the flight search needs to be multi-stop: three legs? Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function takes an array of legs. Each leg is a fromId, toId, date.

First, I need to get the airport codes for New Orleans, Atlanta, and Memphis. So I should use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs.

For New Orleans: query "New Orleans" to get the airport ID (probably MSY.AIRPORT)
Atlanta: query "Atlanta" to get ATL.AIRPORT
Memphis: query "Memphis" to get MEM.AIRPORT

Once I have those IDs, I can structure the legs:

Leg 1: fromId=MSY.AIRPORT, toId=ATL.AIRPORT, date=2024-11-30
Leg 2: fromId=ATL.AIRPORT, toId=MEM.AIRPORT, date=2024-12-12 (12 days after Nov 30 is Dec 12)
Leg 3: fromId=MEM.AIRPORT, toId=MSY.AIRPORT, date=2024-12-24 (12 days after Dec 12 is Dec 24)

Wait, but the user said "staying in each city for twelve days." So from Nov 30 to Dec 12 is 12 days in Atlanta? Wait, Nov 30 + 12 days is Dec 12, so departure from Atlanta would be on Dec 12. Then from Dec 12 +12 days is Dec 24, departure from Memphis on Dec 24.

So the legs are:

1. Nov 30: MSY -> ATL
2. Dec 12: ATL -> MEM
3. Dec 24: MEM -> MSY

But the user said "returning to New Orleans," so the last leg is the return.

Now, the user wants the cheapest connecting flight, so sort by CHEAPEST.

Also, need to check if the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function can handle three legs. The description says "If there are multiple stops, there should be more leg objects in the array." So yes, three legs.

But first, need to get the airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location for each city.

So first tool call: Search_Flight_Location for "New Orleans"
Second: Search_Flight_Location for "Atlanta"
Third: Search_Flight_Location for "Memphis"

Once we have the IDs, then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the three legs, sort=CHEAPEST.

Then, for the taxi part: the user's address is Frenchmen Street in New Orleans. Need to get the googlePlaceId for Frenchmen Street as pick-up, and the airport (MSY) as drop-off for the outbound taxi.

Wait, the taxi is to take them to the airport three hours before the flight. So first, need to know the flight departure time from MSY on Nov 30. But the flight search hasn't been done yet. So maybe after getting the flight details, we can determine the departure time, then calculate the pick-up time as 3 hours before.

But the user is asking to book the taxi now, so perhaps we need to first get the flight details, then use that to schedule the taxi.

But the user's request is to "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands."

So steps:

1. Find the flight details (departure time from MSY on Nov 30, arrival time back in MSY on Dec 24)
2. For outbound taxi: pick-up time is flight departure time minus 3 hours, date is Nov 30
3. For return taxi: pick-up time is flight arrival time plus 1 hour, date is Dec 24

But to get the flight times, we need to first search for the flights. However, the user hasn't provided specific flight times, so maybe the taxi booking is based on the selected flight's schedule.

But since the user is asking to book the taxi as part of the request, we need to first get the flight details, then use those times to book the taxi.

But in the current step, the assistant needs to make tool calls. So first, we need to get the airport IDs for the flight search.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Then, use those IDs to search for multi-stop flights.

Once flights are found, we can get the departure and arrival times, then proceed to taxi booking.

But the user also mentioned their address is Frenchmen Street in New Orleans, so for the taxi pick-up, we need to get the googlePlaceId for Frenchmen Street.

So another tool call: Taxi_Search_Location with query "Frenchmen Street, New Orleans"

Then, for the airport, we need the googlePlaceId for MSY airport. Wait, but Taxi_Search_Location might also be used to get the airport's place ID. Alternatively, maybe the airport's place ID can be derived from the flight location ID, but probably not. So need to search for "Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport" to get its googlePlaceId.

Wait, the user is in New Orleans, so the airport is MSY. So Taxi_Search_Location for "Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport" or "MSY airport".

But the user's address is Frenchmen Street, so pick-up is Frenchmen Street, drop-off for the outbound taxi is the airport (MSY). For the return taxi, pick-up is the airport (MSY) and drop-off is Frenchmen Street.

So steps for taxi:

1. Get googlePlaceId for Frenchmen Street, New Orleans (pick-up for outbound, drop-off for return)
2. Get googlePlaceId for MSY airport (drop-off for outbound, pick-up for return)
3. Once flight times are known, calculate pick-up times and dates.

But since the flight times are not known yet, the taxi booking would depend on the flight search results. However, the user is asking to book the taxi as part of the request, so the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then use those to schedule the taxis.

But in the current context, the assistant is to make tool calls based on the user's query. The user hasn't provided flight details yet, so the first step is to search for the flights.

So the immediate tool calls needed are:

- Search_Flight_Location for "New Orleans"
- Search_Flight_Location for "Atlanta"
- Search_Flight_Location for
