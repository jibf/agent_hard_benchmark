Okay, let's see. The user wants the cheapest economy class air ticket for a multi-stop trip. They're leaving Chicago on Nov 10, 2024, going through Frankfurt on Nov 11, then to Vienna, and returning to Chicago on Nov 24.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The outbound journey has two stops: Chicago to Frankfurt, then Frankfurt to Vienna. The return is Vienna to Chicago. Wait, but the user mentioned traveling through Frankfurt on Nov 11, so the first leg is Chicago to Frankfurt on Nov 10, then Frankfurt to Vienna on Nov 11. Then return from Vienna to Chicago on Nov 24.

So the legs for the outbound would be:
1. From Chicago (ORD?) to Frankfurt (FRA) on 2024-11-10
2. From Frankfurt (FRA) to Vienna (VIE) on 2024-11-11

Then the return leg is Vienna to Chicago on 2024-11-24. Wait, but the user said "return to Chicago on November 24th", so that's a single leg from Vienna to Chicago.

But the user mentioned "multi-stops", so maybe the entire trip is a multi-city flight. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is needed here. The legs array should include all the segments.

Wait, the user's itinerary is:
- Depart Chicago on Nov 10 → Frankfurt (arrive Nov 11)
- Then Frankfurt to Vienna on Nov 11
- Then Vienna to Chicago on Nov 24

Wait, but the dates: leaving Chicago on Nov 10, arriving Frankfurt on Nov 11 (so that's a flight that departs Nov 10 and arrives Nov 11). Then from Frankfurt to Vienna on Nov 11 (same day?), which might not be possible, but maybe the user meant arriving in Frankfurt on Nov 11, then departing Frankfurt on Nov 11 to Vienna. But flights take time, so maybe the second leg is on Nov 12? Wait, the user says "travel through Frankfurt on November 11th", so maybe the arrival in Frankfurt is on Nov 11, then the next flight is on Nov 11. But that's tight. Maybe the user made a typo, but I have to go with what's given.

So legs for the multi-stop search would be:
1. Chicago to Frankfurt on 2024-11-10
2. Frankfurt to Vienna on 2024-11-11
3. Vienna to Chicago on 2024-11-24

Wait, but the user said "return to Chicago on November 24th", so the return is a single leg from Vienna to Chicago on that date.

So the legs array should have three entries? Wait, no. The user's trip is: Chicago → Frankfurt → Vienna → Chicago. So the outbound is two legs (Chicago-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Vienna), and the return is one leg (Vienna-Chicago). But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for multi-stop flights, which typically refers to the outbound journey with multiple stops. However, the return might be a separate leg. Wait, the function description says "Search multi-stop Flights", which probably means a single journey with multiple stops, not including the return. But the user's entire trip includes the return, so maybe it's a round-trip with multiple stops on the way there.

Wait, the user's message says: "set off from Chicago on November 10th, 2024, travel through Frankfurt on November 11th and then fly to Vienna. Finally, I'll return to Chicago on November 24th, 2024."

So the outbound is Chicago → Frankfurt (Nov 10 departure, arriving Nov 11) → Vienna (departing Frankfurt Nov 11, arriving same day?), then stay until Nov 24, then return directly to Chicago.

So the multi-stop flight would be the outbound with two stops (Chicago-Frankfurt-Vienna), and the return is a separate flight Vienna-Chicago.

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for searching multi-stop flights, which would handle the outbound. Then the return would be another flight, but the user might need to search for a round-trip with multi-stop outbound. However, the function parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops include the legs array, which can have multiple legs. So for the entire trip, the legs would be:

1. Chicago to Frankfurt (2024-11-10)
2. Frankfurt to Vienna (2024-11-11)
3. Vienna to Chicago (2024-11-24)

But is that how the function works? The function's example shows legs as an array of objects for each segment. So if the user is doing a multi-city trip with three segments, that's possible.

Wait, the function description says: "If there are multiple stops, there should be more leg objects in the array." So for a trip with two stops (three cities), you have two legs. Wait, no: Chicago to Frankfurt is first leg, Frankfurt to Vienna is second leg. So two legs for the outbound. Then the return is a third leg? But the user's return is a separate flight, so maybe the entire trip is considered as three legs: outbound with two stops, then return.

But the user is asking for the cheapest economy class ticket for the entire journey, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function should be used with all the legs.

Wait, the user's itinerary is:

- Depart Chicago (ORD) on 2024-11-10 → arrive Frankfurt (FRA) on 2024-11-11
- Depart Frankfurt (FRA) on 2024-11-11 → arrive Vienna (VIE) on 2024-11-11 (or next day?)
- Stay until 2024-11-24, then depart Vienna (VIE) → arrive Chicago (ORD) on 2024-11-24 (or next day)

So the legs array should have three entries? Or two for the outbound and one for return? Wait, the function is for multi-stop flights, which typically refers to the outbound journey. But the user's entire trip includes the return, so maybe it's a round-trip with multi-stop outbound. However, the function might not handle the return as part of the same search. Wait, the function's description says "Search multi-stop Flights", which is for one-way with multiple stops. The return would be a separate flight, but the user might need to search for a round-trip, but the available functions don't have a round-trip multi-stop. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, the legs array can have multiple legs. So for a round-trip with a stopover, you could have legs for outbound (two legs) and return (one leg), making three legs total. But I'm not sure if the API supports that. The example given in the function shows multiple legs for a single journey, like a multi-city trip.

Assuming that the user's entire trip (outbound with two stops and return) is considered as three legs, but the user might have intended the outbound as two legs (Chicago-Frankfurt-Vienna) and the return as a separate flight. However, the user says "return to Chicago on November 24th", so the return is a direct flight from Vienna to Chicago.

But the user is asking for the cheapest economy class ticket for the entire journey, so we need to search for a multi-stop flight that includes all legs. Wait, but typically, multi-stop flights refer to the outbound journey. The return would be a separate booking. However, the user might be looking for a single booking that includes all legs, which would be a multi-city trip.

In any case, to proceed, I need to first get the airport codes for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna using Search_Flight_Location.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs.

For Chicago, query "Chicago" to get the airport ID (probably ORD).
For Frankfurt, query "Frankfurt" to get FRA.
For Vienna, query "Vienna" to get VIE.

Once we have those IDs, we can structure the legs for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

The user wants economy class, cheapest, so cabinClass: ECONOMY, sort: CHEAPEST.

The legs array would be:

[
  { "fromId": "ORD.AIRPORT", "toId": "FRA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-10" },
  { "fromId": "FRA.AIRPORT", "toId": "VIE.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-11" },
  { "fromId": "VIE.AIRPORT", "toId": "ORD.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-24" }
]

Wait, but the return leg is on Nov 24, so that's the third leg.

But does the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function support three legs? The example shows "..." implying more legs can be added. So yes, the legs array can have three entries.

So first, need to get the airport IDs via Search_Flight_Location
