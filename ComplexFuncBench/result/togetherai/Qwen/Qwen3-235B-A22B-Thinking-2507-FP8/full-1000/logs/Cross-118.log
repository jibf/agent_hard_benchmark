Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to book a hotel near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for one night on November 10, 2024. Then, they need a car rental picked up from the hotel at 12 PM the next day (November 11) and returned at 10 AM on the third day (November 12) at the airport.

First, I need to find the hotel. The user specified within 20 km of SEA. To search hotels by coordinates, I need the latitude and longitude of the airport. So, I should use the Location_to_Lat_Long function with the query "Seattle–Tacoma International Airport". That will give me the coordinates.

Once I have the coordinates, I can call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates. The arrival date is November 10, 2024, departure is November 11 (since it's one night). Radius is 20 km. The parameters required are arrival_date, departure_date, latitude, longitude. The user didn't specify room count, adults, etc., but the function requires arrival and departure dates, latitude, longitude. The defaults for room_qty and adults are 1, which is probably okay. But maybe I should check if the user mentioned any specifics. The user said "for one night", so arrival is 2024-11-10, departure 2024-11-11.

Next, for the car rental. The pickup is from the hotel at 12 PM on Nov 11, drop off at the airport at 10 AM on Nov 12. But to get the car rental, I need the coordinates of the hotel (for pickup) and the airport (for drop-off). Wait, the user says pickup from the hotel, so the pickup location is the hotel's coordinates. But the hotel hasn't been booked yet, so maybe the hotel search will return coordinates, but since we're in the planning phase, perhaps the car rental search needs the hotel's location. However, the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet. Hmm, this is a problem. The car rental requires pickup and drop-off coordinates. But the hotel isn't booked yet, so we don't have its exact coordinates. Maybe the user expects to first find a hotel near the airport, then use that hotel's location for the car pickup. But since the hotel search hasn't been done yet, perhaps the car rental search can't be completed until after the hotel is selected. However, the user is asking to do both as part of the booking process.

Wait, the user's request is to book the hotel and reserve the car. So the assistant needs to first get the hotel's coordinates (by searching hotels near SEA), but the hotel search will return multiple options. However, the user hasn't specified which hotel, so maybe the car rental parameters need to use the same coordinates as the hotel search? But the hotel search is around SEA's coordinates, so the pickup location for the car would be the same as the hotel's location, which is near SEA. Wait, but the user says "picked up from the hotel", so the pickup location is the hotel's address. But without knowing the exact hotel, maybe the car rental can be searched using the same coordinates as the hotel search (i.e., SEA's coordinates as a proxy). But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the car rental pickup location is the hotel, which is near SEA, so the coordinates would be similar to SEA's. But the user might need to first select a hotel, then get its exact coordinates for the car rental. However, in the current step, the user is asking to book both, so the assistant needs to first get SEA's coordinates to search hotels, then use those coordinates (or the hotel's coordinates once found) for the car rental.

Wait, the first step is to get SEA's coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long. Then use that to search hotels within 20 km. Once the hotel is selected (though the user hasn't chosen one yet), the car rental would need the hotel's coordinates. But since the user hasn't selected a specific hotel, maybe the car rental search can be done using the same SEA coordinates as the hotel search area. But the pickup is from the hotel, which is near SEA, so perhaps the pickup coordinates are the same as SEA's? No, because the hotel is near the airport, but the exact coordinates would vary. However, without a specific hotel, maybe the car rental company allows pickup at the hotel, so the pickup location would be the hotel's address, which we don't have yet. This is a bit of a catch-22.

But the user's instruction is to assist with the query, so perhaps the assistant should first get the airport's coordinates, then search hotels, and then for the car rental, use the airport's coordinates for drop-off (since it's returned at the airport), and for pickup, maybe the same coordinates as the hotel search (SEA's coordinates) as a placeholder. Wait, the user says "picked up from the hotel", so the pickup location is the hotel, which is near SEA. So the pickup coordinates would be the same as the hotel's, which is within 20 km of SEA. But without knowing the exact hotel, perhaps the car rental search can use SEA's coordinates as the pickup location? That might not be accurate, but maybe the car rental companies have options for hotel pickups, and the system can handle it once the hotel is selected. However, the user is asking to reserve the car now, so perhaps the assistant needs to proceed with the information available.

So steps:

1. Use Location_to_Lat_Long with "Seattle–Tacoma International Airport" to get lat/long.
2. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, radius 20, arrival 2024-11-10, departure 2024-11-11.
3. Once hotels are found, select one (but the user hasn't specified which, so maybe the assistant just needs to get the list), but for the car rental, need the hotel's coordinates. However, since the user hasn't chosen a hotel yet, perhaps the car rental parameters will have to use the same coordinates as the hotel search (SEA's coordinates) for pickup, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the car rental pickup is from the hotel, which is near SEA, so the pickup coordinates are the same as the hotel's, which we can approximate as SEA's coordinates. But this might not be correct.

Wait, the user says "reserve a car to be picked up from the hotel". So the pickup location is the hotel, which we don't have the exact coordinates for yet. But the hotel search will return hotels with their coordinates, so perhaps after getting the hotel list, the user would select one, and then the car rental can be booked with that hotel's coordinates. However, the user is asking to do both as part of the current request, so the assistant needs to first get the hotel coordinates (via the hotel search), but the hotel search requires the airport's coordinates first.

So the first tool call should be Location_to_Lat_Long for SEA. Then, use those coordinates to search hotels. Then, for the car rental, the pickup location would be the hotel's coordinates (but since the hotel isn't selected yet, maybe the assistant can't proceed further, but the user might expect the car rental to be based on the same area). Alternatively, the car rental drop-off is at the airport, so drop-off coordinates are SEA's, and pickup is from the hotel, which is near SEA, so pickup coordinates are the same as the hotel search area (SEA's coordinates). But that's an assumption.

Wait, the car rental parameters require both pickup and drop-off coordinates. The user says pickup from the hotel (so pickup location is hotel's coordinates) and drop-off at the airport (SEA's coordinates). So to get the car rental, we need:

- pick_up_latitude and longitude: from the hotel (which we don't have yet)
- drop_off_latitude and longitude: from SEA (which we can get via Location_to_Lat_Long)

But since the hotel hasn't been booked, we don't have its coordinates. Therefore, the correct sequence is:

1. Get SEA's coordinates (Location_to_Lat_Long)
2. Search hotels near SEA (Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates)
3. Once a hotel is selected, get its coordinates (but the user hasn't selected one, so maybe the assistant can't proceed to car rental without that)
However, the user is asking to reserve the car as part of the same request, so perhaps the assistant should first get SEA's coordinates, then search hotels, and then for the car rental, use SEA's coordinates for drop-off, and for pickup, maybe the same coordinates (assuming the hotel is near SEA, so pickup is at a location near SEA). But the pickup is from the hotel, which is a specific location. Without the hotel's exact coordinates, the car rental search might not be accurate. However, the user might expect that the hotel search will provide the necessary coordinates for the car pickup.

Given that, the assistant should first call Location_to_Lat_Long for SEA to get its coordinates. Then use those coordinates to search hotels. Once the hotel is found (even if it's a list), the next step would be to use the hotel's coordinates for the car pickup. But since the user hasn't selected a specific hotel, perhaps the car rental search can't be completed yet. However, the user's request is to "reserve a car", so maybe the system allows reserving a car with the hotel location once the hotel is selected, but in this case, the assistant needs to first get the hotel options.
