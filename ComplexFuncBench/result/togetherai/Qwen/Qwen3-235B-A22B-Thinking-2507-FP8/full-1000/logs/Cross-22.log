Okay, let's see. The user wants to plan a trip to London from December 1st to 6th, 2024. They need a hotel near Big Ben and a taxi from King's Cross to Big Ben at 10 a.m. on the 1st.

First, I need to figure out the steps. For the hotel, they want it nearest to Big Ben. So I should start by finding the location ID for Big Ben. Wait, the tools available include Search_Hotel_Destination, which can get the latitude and longitude. But maybe I need to use Search_Attractions or Search_Attractions_Location to get the ID for Big Ben. Wait, there's a Search_Attractions function that requires an ID from Search_Attractions_Location. Let me check the tools again.

Looking at the tools: Search_Hotel_Destination is for finding hotels by location, but to get the dest_id for Search_Hotels, we need to use Search_Hotel_Destination first. Wait, the user wants a hotel near Big Ben, so first, I need to get the location details for Big Ben. Maybe use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Big Ben, London, UK" to get the dest_id. Wait, but Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it's for finding hotels by location, but the parameters just take a query. The response includes latitude and longitude. But for Search_Hotels, the required parameters include dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first step: call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Big Ben, London, UK" to get the dest_id.

Wait, but Big Ben is an attraction, not a hotel destination. Maybe the hotel destination would be London, but they want the hotel near Big Ben. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe use Search_Attractions to find Big Ben's ID, then get its location, then find hotels near that location. Let's see.

Wait, the user says "find a hotel that's nearest to the Big Ben". So the hotel search needs to be in the area of Big Ben. So first, we need the coordinates or dest_id for Big Ben. Let's check the tools.

There's Search_Hotel_Destination which takes a query and returns location data. So if I query "Big Ben, London, UK", it might return the coordinates. Then, using those coordinates, we can search for hotels. But the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response probably includes dest_id. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Big Ben, London, UK" to get the dest_id, then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

Wait, but maybe Big Ben is an attraction, so perhaps the correct approach is to use Search_Attractions to find Big Ben's ID, then get its location. Wait, the Get_Availability_Calendar requires an ID from Search_Attraction_Location. Let me check the Search_Attraction_Location function. Wait, there's a Taxi_Search_Location, but for attractions, there's Search_Attractions and Search_Attraction_Location? Wait, looking at the tools:

There's a function called Search_Attractions, which requires an ID from Search_Attraction_Location (api/v1/attraction/searchLocation). So first, to get the ID for Big Ben, we need to call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Big Ben, London, UK". Wait, but the tool names: there's Taxi_Search_Location, but for attractions, the function to get the ID is probably Search_Attraction_Location, but in the tools provided, the function names are:

Wait, looking at the tools list:

- Search_Hotel_Destination: for hotels, returns latitude/longitude.

- Get_Availability_Calendar: requires id from Search_Attraction_Location (api/v1/attraction/searchLocation).

- Search_Attractions: requires id from Search_Attraction_Location.

- Taxi_Search_Location: for taxi locations.

So for the attraction (Big Ben), we need to first call Search_Attraction_Location (but the tool name here is not listed; wait, the tool for getting attraction location ID is probably part of the Attraction collection. Wait, the Get_Availability_Calendar description says: "id can be retrieved from api/v1/attraction/searchLocation endpoint in Attraction collection as productId inside products or destinations."

So the function to get the attraction ID is not directly listed as a tool here. Wait, the tools provided are the ones listed in the <tools> section. Let me check again.

The tools provided are:

1. Search_Taxi

2. Search_Hotel_Destination

3. Get_Availability_Calendar

4. Search_Attractions

5. Taxi_Search_Location

6. Search_Hotels

So for attractions, to get the ID, we need to use Search_Attractions? Wait, no. The Search_Attractions function requires an ID, which comes from Search_Attraction_Location. But there's no tool called Search_Attraction_Location listed here. Wait, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location is only for taxi, but for attractions, perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination is not the right one.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's re-express:

The user wants a hotel near Big Ben. To search hotels near Big Ben, we need the dest_id for Big Ben's location. The Search_Hotel_Destination function takes a query (like "Big Ben, London, UK") and returns location data, which includes dest_id. So first step: call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Big Ben, London, UK" to get the dest_id. Then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

But maybe Big Ben is not a hotel destination, so the Search_Hotel_Destination might not return the correct dest_id. Alternatively, perhaps the dest_id for London is needed, but the user wants the hotel near Big Ben, so maybe the coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination for Big Ben can be used. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it returns latitude and longitude. So if we get the lat/long of Big Ben, then when searching hotels, we can use those coordinates. But the Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, not lat/long. Hmm.

Wait, looking at Search_Hotels parameters: dest_id is required, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. So Search_Hotel_Destination's response must include dest_id. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Big Ben, London, UK" to get the dest_id, then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels.

But maybe "Big Ben" as a query in Search_Hotel_Destination will return the correct location ID for the area around Big Ben.

So step 1: Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Big Ben, London, UK".

Then, step 2: Search_Hotels with the obtained dest_id, arrival_date 2024-12-01, departure_date 2024-12-06, sort_by distance (since they want nearest), and other parameters like adults, room_qty, etc. The user didn't specify number of adults or rooms, but maybe default to 1 adult and 1 room, but the user says "my family", so maybe assume 2 adults and some children. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the function can be called with defaults, but the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. Wait, the required parameters for Search_Hotels are ["search_type", "arrival_date", "dest_id", "departure_date"]. So search_type comes from Search_Hotel_Destination's response. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response probably includes search_type. So after getting dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination, we can get search_type as well.

So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Big Ben, London, UK".

Then, use the dest_id and search_type from that response to call Search_Hotels with arrival_date 2024-12-01, departure_date 2024-12-06, sort_by distance.

Now, for the taxi part: arrange a taxi from King's Cross to Big Ben at 10 a.m. on Dec 1st.

To do that, we need the googlePlaceId for pick_up (King's Cross) and drop_off (Big Ben). So first, call Taxi_Search_Location for "King's Cross, London, UK" to get its googlePlaceId, and another call for "Big Ben, London, UK" to get its googlePlaceId.

Then, use those place IDs in Search_Taxi with pick_up_date 2024-12-01, pick_up_time 10:00.

So steps:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Big Ben, London, UK" to get dest_id for hotels.

2. Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival 2024-12-01, departure 2024-12-06.

3. Taxi_Search_Location for "King's Cross, London, UK" to get pick_up_place_id.

4. Taxi_Search_Location for "Big Ben, London, UK" to get drop_off_place_id.

5. Search_Taxi with the two place IDs, date 2024-12-01, time 10:00.

But the user mentioned "arrange a taxi for us at 10 a.m. on the 1st to take us from King's Cross to the Big Ben." So the taxi is on Dec 1st, 10 AM.

So the required
