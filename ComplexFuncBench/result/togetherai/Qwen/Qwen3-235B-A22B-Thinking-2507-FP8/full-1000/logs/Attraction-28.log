2025-08-13 22:05:15,117 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-28 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about Tokyo Tower after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Tokyo Tower" as the query. That gave me a product slug: prohuubvrsbc-red-tokyo-tower-night-ticket.

Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug. The response has a lot of info. The user probably wants a concise summary. Let me check the key points.

The attraction is called "Red Tokyo Tower Night Ticket" operated by RED¬∞ Tokyo Tower. It's a digital playground with high-tech attractions across three floors. Features include AR games, VR rides, robot fights (with extra fee), and retro games. The price is $25.29 USD, includes admission, WiFi, fees, restrooms, and unlimited rides. Cancellation is free, and it's wheelchair accessible but has some restrictions for certain health conditions.

Wait, the user mentioned Tokyo Tower, but the attraction here is a specific ticket for a digital playground inside Tokyo Tower. Maybe they thought it's the tower itself, but this is an activity within it. I should clarify that. Also, note the additional info like age requirements and physical fitness needed.

I need to present this info clearly, highlighting what's included, price, accessibility, and any important notes. Make sure to mention it's a specific experience at Tokyo Tower, not the tower's general info. Check if there's anything else the user might need, like how to book or more details on the attractions. But since the user just asked for detailed info, summarizing the key points from the API response should suffice.
