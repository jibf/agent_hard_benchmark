Right now, I'm planning to set off from San Francisco on December 1st, 2024, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague. Finally, I'll return to San Francisco on December 15th, 2024. Check the details of the flights. I want to know things like the baggage limit. Thanks for your help.

2025-08-13 22:48:11,421 - evaluation_logger_Flights-41 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants the cheapest economy class ticket for a multi-stop trip. They're leaving San Francisco on Dec 1, 2024, going through Amsterdam on Dec 2, then to Prague, and returning to SF on Dec 15.

First, I need to get the airport IDs. The previous tool calls for Search_Flight_Location gave me SFO.AIRPORT, AMS.AIRPORT, and PRG.AIRPORT. So those are the correct IDs.

Now, the next step is to search for multi-stop flights using Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. The legs should be structured as an array. The first leg is SFO to AMS on Dec 1. Wait, the user said "set off from San Francisco on December 1st, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd". So departure from SFO on Dec 1, arriving in AMS on Dec 2. Then from AMS to PRG on Dec 2? Or maybe the dates are the departure dates for each leg.

Wait, the user's itinerary: Depart SF on Dec 1, travel through Amsterdam on Dec 2, then fly to Prague. So the first leg is SFO to AMS, departing Dec 1, arriving Dec 2. Then the second leg is AMS to PRG, departing Dec 2. Then the return is from PRG to SFO on Dec 15.

Wait, the user says: "set off from San Francisco on December 1st, 2024, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague. Finally, I'll return to San Francisco on December 15th, 2024."

So the outbound journey has two stops: SFO -> AMS (Dec 1 departure, arriving Dec 2), then AMS -> PRG (Dec 2 departure). Then the return is PRG -> SFO on Dec 15.

Wait, but the return is from Prague to SF on Dec 15. So the legs for the multi-stop search would be:

Leg 1: SFO to AMS, date Dec 1, 2024

Leg 2: AMS to PRG, date Dec 2, 2024

But the return trip is a separate leg? Wait, the user is doing a round trip, but the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for multi-stop flights, which might be one-way with multiple stops. However, the return trip is another leg. Wait, the user's request is a bit complex. Let me check the function parameters.

The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's legs parameter is an array of leg objects. Each leg has fromId, toId, date. So for a round trip with multiple stops, would that be four legs? Wait, no. The user's trip is:

Outbound: SFO -> AMS (Dec 1) -> PRG (Dec 2)

Return: PRG -> SFO (Dec 15)

But the return is direct? Or does the return also have stops? The user says "return to San Francisco on December 15th", so probably direct from PRG to SFO.

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is for multi-stop flights, which typically refers to one-way with multiple stops. However, the user's entire trip includes both outbound (with two stops) and return (direct). Wait, but the function might not handle round trips. Wait, looking at the function description: "Search multi-stop Flights." So maybe it's for one-way with multiple stops. But the user's request includes a return trip. Hmm.

Wait, the user says: "set off from San Francisco on December 1st, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague. Finally, I'll return to San Francisco on December 15th."

So the entire trip is SFO -> AMS -> PRG (Dec 1-2), then PRG -> SFO (Dec 15). So the outbound is two legs (SFO-AMS, AMS-PRG), and the return is one leg (PRG-SFO). But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's legs array would need to include all legs of the journey. Wait, but is the return trip part of the same multi-stop search? Or is it a separate booking?

The function's example shows legs as an array with multiple stops, but the return trip would be a separate leg. However, the user is asking for a round trip with a stopover in Amsterdam. Wait, maybe the user is doing a multi-city trip: SFO to AMS, AMS to PRG, then PRG to SFO. So three legs total.

Wait, the user's description: "set off from San Francisco on December 1st, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague. Finally, I'll return to San Francisco on December 15th."

So the itinerary is:

1. SFO -> AMS on Dec 1

2. AMS -> PRG on Dec 2

3. PRG -> SFO on Dec 15

Therefore, the legs array should have three entries? Wait, no. Wait, the first two legs are the outbound journey (SFO to AMS to PRG), and the third leg is the return (PRG to SFO). So the legs array would be:

[

  {fromId: SFO.AIRPORT, toId: AMS.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-01},

  {fromId: AMS.AIRPORT, toId: PRG.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-02},

  {fromId: PRG.AIRPORT, toId: SFO.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-15}

]

But does the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function support round trips with multiple stops? The function's description says "Search multi-stop Flights." which usually refers to one-way with multiple stops, but maybe the API allows for multi-city trips with multiple legs, including return.

Assuming that the function can handle multiple legs for a single trip (i.e., multi-city), then the legs array should include all three legs.

Wait, but the user's return is on Dec 15, which is after the arrival in Prague on Dec 2. So the entire trip is SFO -> AMS -> PRG -> SFO, with dates Dec 1, Dec 2, Dec 15.

Therefore, the legs array should have three legs.

But let me check the function's parameters. The legs parameter is described as: "The legs must contain the fromId, toId and date in object format and must be passed in an array. EXAMPLE: [ { 'fromId': 'BOM.AIRPORT', 'toId': 'AMD.AIRPORT', 'date': '2024-05-25' }, ... ] Note: If there are multiple stops, there should be more leg objects in the array."

So the example shows multiple legs for a single journey (e.g., BOM to AMD, then AMD to another place). So for a round trip with a stopover, it's possible that the legs array includes all segments, including the return.

Therefore, for the user's request, the legs array should have three legs:

1. SFO to AMS on 2024-12-01

2. AMS to PRG on 2024-12-02

3. PRG to SFO on 2024-12-15

Wait, but the user said "travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague". So the arrival in Amsterdam is on Dec 2, then departure from Amsterdam to Prague on Dec 2? Or arrival on Dec 2 and departure on Dec 3? The user's wording is a bit unclear. But the user says "set off from San Francisco on December 1st, travel through Amsterdam on December 2nd and then fly to Prague". So departing SF on Dec 1, arriving in AMS on Dec 2, then departing AMS on Dec 2 to PRG. So the second leg's date is Dec 2.

Then the return is from PRG to SFO on Dec 15.

So the legs are:

Leg 1: SFO -> AMS, date 2024-12-01

Leg 2: AMS -> PRG, date 2024-12-02

Leg 3: PRG -> SFO, date 2024-12-15

Therefore, the legs array should have these three entries.

Now, the user wants the cheapest economy class. So cabinClass should be ECONOMY, sort should be CHEAPEST.

Adults: default is 1, but the user didn't specify number of passengers, so assume 1 adult.

Children: not mentioned, so probably 0.

So the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be:

adults: 1

legs: [ {fromId: "SFO.AIRPORT", toId: "AMS.AIRPORT", date: "2024-12-01"}, {fromId: "AMS.AIRPORT", toId: "PRG.AIRPORT", date: "2024-12-02"}, {fromId: "PRG.AIRPORT", toId: "SFO.AIRPORT", date: "2024-12-15"} ]

cabinClass: "ECONOMY"

sort: "CHEAPEST"
