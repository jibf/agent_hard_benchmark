Okay, let's see. The user wants to find the cheapest multi-stop flight from Chengdu to Seattle with a layover in Doha around November 25, 2024. Also, no overnight layovers, and then get the seat map for that flight.

First, I need to figure out the airports for Chengdu, Doha, and Seattle. So I should use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the correct airport IDs. Let me check the parameters for that function. It requires a query, so I'll search for each city.

Starting with Chengdu. The query would be "Chengdu". Then Doha, and Seattle. Once I have the airport IDs, I can structure the legs for the multi-stop flight. The legs should be Chengdu to Doha, then Doha to Seattle. The date for the first leg is around November 25, but since the user mentioned "around", maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function can help find the cheapest dates within 5 days before and after. Wait, the user said "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight", so maybe first use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the flight details, including the offerToken needed for the seat map.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the user's date is November 25, 2024. So the legs would be from Chengdu to Doha on a date around Nov 25, then Doha to Seattle on the next day (since no overnight layovers, the layover must be same day or very short). But the function parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops require legs as an array with fromId, toId, date. So first, I need the airport IDs.

So step 1: Use Search_Flight_Location for Chengdu, Doha, Seattle to get their IDs.

Let me call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

First, Chengdu. Query "Chengdu". Then Doha, then Seattle.

Once I have the IDs, say Chengdu is CTU.AIRPORT, Doha is DOH.AIRPORT, Seattle is SEA.AIRPORT.

Then, the legs for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops would be:

[
  { "fromId": "CTU.AIRPORT", "toId": "DOH.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-25" },
  { "fromId": "DOH.AIRPORT", "toId": "SEA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-26" }
]

But since the user said "around November 25", maybe the first leg date is 2024-11-25, and the second leg would be the next day. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function allows 5 days before and after, so it will check dates from 2024-11-20 to 2024-11-30 for the first leg, and then the second leg would adjust accordingly. Wait, the function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So for each leg, the date is the query date, and it checks Â±5 days. But in this case, the legs are connected, so the second leg's date depends on the first leg's arrival.

But the user specified a layover in Doha, so the first leg arrives in Doha, then the second leg departs from Doha. The layover shouldn't be overnight, so the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's arrival date. Wait, but flights can have layovers on the same day. For example, depart Chengdu on Nov 25 morning, arrive Doha same day, then depart Doha same day to Seattle. But if the layover is too long, it might be overnight. The user doesn't accept overnight layovers, so the layover must be less than 24 hours, but preferably same day.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's legs require specific dates for each leg. So perhaps the first leg date is 2024-11-25, and the second leg date is also 2024-11-25 (if possible) or 2024-11-26. But the function might handle the date ranges.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's parameters: legs is an array where each leg has fromId, toId, date. The date for each leg is the intended date, and the API checks 5 days before and after that date for the cheapest options.

So for the first leg (Chengdu to Doha), date is 2024-11-25. The API will check from 2024-11-20 to 2024-11-30. Similarly, the second leg (Doha to Seattle) date would be, say, 2024-11-26 (assuming a one-day layover), but the user doesn't want overnight layovers, so maybe the second leg should be on the same day as the first leg's arrival. But flight durations might make that impossible. For example, Chengdu to Doha might take 10 hours, arriving on the same day, then Doha to Seattle could depart the same day. So the second leg date would be the same as the first leg's date.

But the user said "around November 25", so maybe the first leg is on 2024-11-25, and the second leg is also on 2024-11-25. However, depending on flight times, that might not be possible. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function would find the cheapest combination within the date ranges.

So first, I need to get the airport IDs.

Let me structure the tool calls:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Chengdu"
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Doha"
3. Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle"

Once I have the IDs, then call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs using those IDs and dates around Nov 25.

Then, from the response of Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, get the cheapest flight's offerToken (wait, does Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops return offerToken? Let me check the function description.

Wait, Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops description says: "This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." It doesn't mention offerToken. The offerToken is from Search_Flights_Multi_Stops or SearchFlights.

Wait, the Get_Seat_Map function requires offerToken, which is from Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

So the process would be:

- Use Search_Flight_Location to get airport IDs.

- Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates and prices.

- Then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the specific dates (from the cheapest result) to get the flight details, including offerToken.

- Then use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight, so first Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops gives the dates, then Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight with offerToken, then Get_Seat_Map.

But the user's instruction says: "Look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map for the flight."

So first, find the cheapest dates via Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then get the seat map.

But to get the seat map, need offerToken from Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

So steps:

1. Get airport IDs for Chengdu, Doha, Seattle.

2. Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs (Chengdu->Doha on 2024-11-25, Doha->Seattle on 2024-11-26) to find cheapest dates.

Wait, but the second leg date should be after the first leg. Since the layover can't be overnight, the second leg date should be the same as the first leg's arrival date. But depending on flight times, maybe the second leg is same day or next day. However, the user said no overnight layovers, so the layover must be less than 24 hours, but same day is better.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's legs require specific dates. So perhaps the first leg date is 2024-11-25, and the second leg date is 2024-11-25 (same day) or 2024-11-26. But the API will check 5 days around each date.

Wait, the function's legs parameter: for each leg, the date is the intended date, and the API checks 5 days before and after that date. So for the first leg, date 2024-11-25, it checks 2024-11-20 to 2024-11-30. For the second leg, if we set date as 2024-11-26, it checks 2024-11-21 to 2024-12-01. But
