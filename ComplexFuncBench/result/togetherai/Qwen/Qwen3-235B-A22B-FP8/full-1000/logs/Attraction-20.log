2025-08-13 21:23:42,639 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Stone Forest after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Stone Forest" as the query. The response listed three products, and I picked the first one, which was the Stone Forest Day Tour in Kunming, China. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug provided.

The data from Get_Attraction_Details gives a lot of info. The tour is operated by 51 Adventures, costs around $105.55 USD, and includes a private tour to Naigu Stone Forest and Suogeyi Sani village. It mentions things like wheelchair accessibility, cancellation policy, and what's included versus not included. There's also a review from Charlene who had a bad experience, which might be important to mention.

I need to present this info clearly. Start with a brief description of the attraction and the tour. Highlight key points like location (Kunming, China), what's included, the price, and the cancellation policy. Also, mention the user review to give a balanced view. Make sure to note any requirements like minimum 2 people per booking and that children need an adult. Maybe add a tip about checking the latest reviews and contacting the operator for any concerns. Keep it friendly and helpful, making sure the user feels informed but not overwhelmed.
