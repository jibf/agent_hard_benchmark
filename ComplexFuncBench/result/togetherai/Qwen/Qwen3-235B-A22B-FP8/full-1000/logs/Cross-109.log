Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want to have a party in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles on December 26, 2024. They need a popular hotel and a car rental with specific pickup and drop-off times.

Starting with the hotel: The user mentioned Beverly Hills, LA. To find hotels there, I should use the Search_Hotel_Destination function. The query parameter should be "Beverly Hills, Los Angeles". That should give the destination ID needed for the Search_Hotels function. 

Next, once I have the dest_id from the destination search, I can call Search_Hotels. The parameters would include arrival_date as 2024-12-26, departure_date as 2024-12-27, adults as 5 (since it's the user and four friends), and sort_by as "popularity" to get the most popular hotel. Also, check if there are any filters or categories needed, but maybe the default is okay.

Then, for the car rental. The user wants to pick up the car at 10 am on the 26th near the hotel and return it at 5 pm the next day. To search for car rentals, the Search_Car_Rentals function is needed. The parameters require coordinates for pick-up and drop-off. Since the hotel's location is part of the search, after getting the hotel's coordinates from the Search_Hotel_Destination response, those can be used. Wait, but the Search_Car_Rentals requires both pick-up and drop-off coordinates. However, the user says "near the party hotel" and return at the same location. So maybe the pick-up and drop-off coordinates are the same as the hotel's coordinates. But the hotel's coordinates would be obtained from the Search_Hotel_Destination, which might include that info. However, the Search_Car_Rentals function's parameters require both pick-up and drop-off coordinates. But the user hasn't provided the hotel's exact coordinates yet. So first, I need to get the hotel's coordinates via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use those coordinates for the car rental search. 

Wait, but the user hasn't specified the hotel's name yet. They just want the most popular one. So the process would be: first, get the destination ID for Beverly Hills, LA. Then search hotels with that dest_id, sorted by popularity. Then, from the hotel search results, get the coordinates of the hotel. Then use those coordinates for the car rental pickup and drop-off. But the car rental function requires both pick-up and drop-off coordinates. Since the user wants to return the car at the same location, the drop-off coordinates would be the same as the pick-up. So once the hotel's coordinates are known, both pick-up and drop-off would use those. But how to get the hotel's coordinates? The Search_Hotels function's response might include that. However, in the tools provided, the Search_Hotels function's parameters include dest_id, which is obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination. The Search_Hotel_Destination's response probably includes coordinates. Let me check the tool descriptions again.

Looking at the Search_Hotel_Destination function: "This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So yes, after getting the destination, we have the coordinates. But wait, the user wants the most popular hotel. The Search_Hotels function would return a list of hotels, each with their own coordinates. However, the initial Search_Hotel_Destination gives coordinates for the destination, which might be a general area. But the car rental might need specific coordinates for the exact pickup location. However, the user says "near the party hotel", so maybe the hotel's coordinates are used. But since the user hasn't booked the hotel yet, perhaps the car rental is just based on the destination coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the car rental location is near the hotel, but without knowing the hotel's exact coordinates, the best we can do is use the destination coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination. 

Wait, the user's plan is to have the party at the hotel, so they need the car pickup near that hotel. Therefore, the car rental's pickup and drop-off coordinates should be the same as the hotel's coordinates. But to get the hotel's coordinates, we need to first get the hotel details from the Search_Hotels function. However, the Search_Hotels function's response might include the hotel's coordinates. But in the tools provided, the Search_Hotels function's parameters don't include returning coordinates. The tool's description says the function's purpose is to search hotels, but the parameters don't specify what data is returned. However, the user's initial step is to find the hotel, which would require knowing its coordinates for the car rental. 

This seems like a potential issue because the tools might not directly provide the hotel's coordinates from the Search_Hotels function. But perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination gives the coordinates for the destination (Beverly Hills), which is a general area. The car rental might be available in that area, and the exact pickup/drop-off would be determined after selecting the hotel. However, since the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet, maybe the car rental search can be done using the destination coordinates, and then once the hotel is chosen, the exact coordinates can be used. 

Alternatively, maybe the car rental's pickup and drop-off locations are based on the destination's coordinates, not the specific hotel. So the process would be:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Beverly Hills, Los Angeles" to get the coordinates (latitude and longitude) for that area. This gives the dest_id and coordinates.

2. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, adults=5, sort_by=popularity to get the most popular hotel. The user would then have that info.

3. For the car rental, use the coordinates from the Search_Hotel_Destination (since the hotel is in that area) to search for car rentals. The pickup and drop-off would be at those coordinates. However, the car rental function requires both pickup and drop-off coordinates. Since the user wants to return the car at the same location, the drop-off coordinates would be the same as the pickup. 

But the car rental function's parameters require both pickup and drop-off coordinates. So, using the coordinates from the destination search (Beverly Hills) for both pickup and drop-off. 

Wait, but the user wants to pick it up near the party hotel. So the hotel's coordinates would be more precise. However, without knowing the hotel's exact coordinates yet, the best we can do is use the destination's coordinates. Once the user selects the hotel from the search results, they might have to get the hotel's exact coordinates for the car rental. But since the user is asking for a recommendation, maybe the car rental is based on the destination coordinates. 

So the steps would be:

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Beverly Hills, Los Angeles" to get the coordinates (latitude and longitude) for that area. Then, use those coordinates in the Search_Car_Rentals function. 

But the car rental parameters require both pickup and drop-off coordinates. Since the user wants to return the car at the same location, both coordinates would be the same as the destination's coordinates. 

So, the plan is:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Beverly Hills, Los Angeles" to get the coordinates and dest_id.

2. Use the dest_id from step 1 to call Search_Hotels with arrival_date=2024-12-26, departure_date=2024-12-27, adults=5, sort_by="popularity" to get the most popular hotel.

3. For the car rental, use the coordinates from the Search_Hotel_Destination (since the hotel is in that area) for both pickup and drop-off. The pickup date is 2024-12-26, pickup time 10:00, drop-off date 2024-12-27, drop-off time 17:00.

But wait, the Search_Car_Rentals function requires pick_up_longitude, pick_up_latitude, drop_off_longitude, drop_off_latitude. So, after getting the coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination, which gives latitude and longitude, those would be used for both pickup and drop-off.

However, the Search_Car_Rentals function's parameters also require dates and times. The pickup date is 2024-12-26 at 10:00, drop-off is 2024-12-27 at 17:00.

So, putting it all together, the tool calls would be:

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination to get the coordinates and dest_id.

Then, call Search_Hotels with the dest_id.

Then, call Search_Car_Rentals with the coordinates from the first step.

But the user's question requires both hotel and car rental recommendations, so the assistant needs to make all three calls in sequence. However, the tools require that each function is called with the necessary parameters, which may depend on previous calls.

But in the current setup, the assistant can only call the functions based on the information available. Since the user hasn't provided coordinates for Beverly Hills, the first step is to get that via Search_Hotel_Destination. Then use that to search for hotels and car rentals.

Therefore, the first tool call should be to Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Beverly Hills, Los Angeles".
