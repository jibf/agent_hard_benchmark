Okay, let's break down what the user needs. Aden is staying at the Pudong Shangri-La in Shanghai with hotel_id 181422. They want attraction recommendations near the hotel and detailed descriptions.

First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function with the hotel_id. The response mentioned the Oriental Pearl Tower as the closest landmark. That's a good start. Now, I need more details about this attraction.

Next, I called Search_Attraction_Location with "Oriental Pearl Tower" to get the product slug. The data gave me the slug "prz1xpmyzjoq-oriental-pearl-tower-tickets-booking". 

Then, using Get_Attraction_Details with that slug provided comprehensive info: description, opening hours, what's included, pricing, etc. 

Now, I should compile this information into a user-friendly response. Highlight the main points like the tower's features, ticket details, and practical info like free cancellation and pricing. Make sure to mention the proximity to the hotel and maybe suggest checking the exact distance or transportation options. Also, note the highlights like the observatories, VR roller coaster, and the restaurant. Include the price and cancellation policy so Aden knows what to expect. Keep it clear and concise, ensuring all key details are covered without overwhelming the user.
