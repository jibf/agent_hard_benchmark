Okay, let's break down the user's request. They need help checking details for the fastest flights from Montreal to Miami on Nov 20, 2024, and then Miami to Orlando on Nov 22, 2024. They want to book the tickets separately. Also, they need hotel options within 30 km of the airports in Miami and Orlando based on arrival airports.

First, I need to find the flights. The user specified the fastest flights, so I should use the Search_Flights function with sort set to FASTEST. But to do that, I need the departure and arrival airport IDs. So I should first use Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando to get their location IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned Montreal to Miami and then Miami to Orlando. So for the first flight, fromId is Montreal's airport ID, toId is Miami's. DepartDate is 2024-11-20. ReturnDate isn't needed since it's a one-way. Then the second flight is Miami to Orlando, departDate 2024-11-22, again one-way. But the user wants to book separately, so each flight is a separate search.

So first, get the location IDs for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando. Then perform two Search_Flights calls: one for Montreal to Miami, another for Miami to Orlando. Then get the flight details using Get_Flight_Details with the tokens from those searches.

Next, for hotels in Miami and Orlando. The user wants hotels within 30 km of the arrival airports. So for Miami, after getting the arrival airport's coordinates (from the flight details?), or maybe from the airport's location. Wait, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires latitude and longitude. So I need to get the coordinates of the arrival airports in Miami and Orlando.

But how? The Search_Flight_Location gives airport info, including maybe coordinates? The function's description says it finds airports by location, etc., but the parameters only take a query. The response might include airport details like IATA code, but not sure about coordinates. Alternatively, maybe there's another function to get coordinates from airport code, but since the available tools don't include that, perhaps I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name as the query.

For example, for Miami Airport (MIA), use Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami International Airport" to get its coordinates. Similarly for Orlando International Airport (ORL). Then use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 30 km, arrival and departure dates based on the stay. The user is staying in Miami for two days (arriving Nov 20, so check-out Nov 22), and Orlando from Nov 22 to Nov 24.

Wait, the user's stay in Miami is two days each. Wait, the original message says: "I'm going to stay in Miami and Orlando for two days each." So after arriving in Miami on Nov 20, they stay two days (depart Nov 22), then go to Orlando on Nov 22, stay two days (depart Nov 24). Wait, but the flight from Miami to Orlando is on Nov 22. So arrival in Orlando on Nov 22, then stay two days, leaving Nov 24.

So for hotels in Miami: arrival_date is 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22. For Orlando: arrival_date 2024-11-22, departure_date 2024-11-24.

So steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, Orlando to get their location IDs.

2. Use Search_Flights for each leg (Montreal to Miami and Miami to Orlando) with sort FASTEST.

3. For each flight, get the token and use Get_Flight_Details to retrieve details.

4. For each destination (Miami and Orlando), get the airport's coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long on the airport name (from flight details? Or from Search_Flight_Location response? Need to check if the flight search returns airport details with coordinates. But in the available functions, the Search_Flights returns flight data, which might include arrival and departure airport codes. Then, using those codes, use Location_to_Lat_Long to get coordinates.

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location's response might include the airport's city name, but not sure about coordinates. So perhaps after getting the flight details, we can get the arrival airport code (like MIA for Miami) and then use that as the query in Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. But if the airport's name is known, like "Miami International Airport", that could be the query.

Alternatively, maybe the Get_Flight_Details includes the arrival airport's coordinates. But looking at the functions provided, the Get_Flight_Details function's parameters only take a token and return details like baggage, prices, etc., but not the airport's coordinates. So we need another way to get the coordinates.

Therefore, the approach would be:

After obtaining the flight details for each flight, extract the arrival airport code (e.g., MIA for Miami, ORL for Orlando). Then use Search_Flight_Location again with the airport code to get the airport's name, then use that name in Location_to_Lat_Long to get coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the airport code can be used directly in the Location_to_Lat_Long query.

But the user might not have provided the airport codes yet. So first, when we do Search_Flight_Location for "Miami", we might get a list of airports, including MIA. Similarly for Orlando, maybe MCO (Orlando International). Then use those codes in the Location_to_Lat_Long function.

But since the assistant can't do that without the actual API responses, in the tool calls, we need to structure the steps.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city:

- Query "Montreal" to get departure airport ID for the first flight.

- Query "Miami" to get arrival airport ID for the first flight and departure for the second.

- Query "Orlando" to get arrival airport ID for the second flight.

Then use those IDs in Search_Flights.

Then, after getting the flight details, use the arrival airport codes from each flight's data to get coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long.

For example, first flight's arrival airport is MIA (Miami), so call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami International Airport" to get lat/long. Then use that in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Miami stay (Nov 20-22). Similarly, second flight's arrival is Orlando (maybe MCO), so get its coordinates and search hotels for Nov 22-24.

So the tool calls would start with Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs, then proceed to search flights, get details, then get coordinates for hotels.

But since the user hasn't provided any prior data, the assistant needs to make these steps in sequence.

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. However, the user's initial message requires multiple steps. But in the response, the assistant should outline the first step, which is to get the location IDs for the cities.

Wait, but the user's instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can plan multiple tool calls in sequence.

But in the example, the assistant should output each tool call in order. However, the user's message might require a series of steps. Since the assistant can't execute them, it has to generate the necessary tool calls in the order they should be made.

So the first step is to get the location IDs for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando using Search_Flight_Location.

Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location function's description says it's to find airports by their location, address, etc. So the assistant should call Search_Flight_Location three times: once for Montreal, once for Miami, and once for Orlando. But in the tools, the function is called Search_Flight_Location, which takes a query parameter.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Montreal" to get its airport ID.

Then, same for Miami and Orlando.

But since the assistant can only make one tool call per step, but the user's request requires multiple steps, the assistant should start with the first necessary tool call.

But the user's initial message requires a comprehensive answer, so the assistant should plan all necessary tool calls in sequence.

Wait, but according to the instructions, the assistant should return a tool call if needed. If multiple functions are needed, the assistant should return the first one, and then in subsequent interactions, the user (or system) would provide the response to proceed.

But in this case, the user is asking for a complete answer, so the assistant needs to plan all necessary steps.

But given the tools, the assistant must generate the required tool calls in order.

So the first step is to get the location IDs for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando using Search_Flight_Location.

Then, use those IDs to search for flights.

Then, get flight details.

Then, get the arrival airports' coordinates for Miami and Orlando.

Then, search hotels.

So the assistant should generate the first tool call for Search_Flight_Location with query "Montreal".

But since the user hasn't provided any prior information, the assistant must start by gathering all necessary data.

But since the assistant can only output one tool call at a time, the initial response would be to call Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, then in subsequent steps, after receiving the response, proceed to the next calls.

But the user's query is a single message, so the assistant should generate
