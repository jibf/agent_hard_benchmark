Okay, let's see. The user is looking for Opera-themed attractions in Rome under $100. The first attraction they checked was "Opera Serenades in Palazzo Doria Pamphilj" which costs $103.95, so that's over 100. Then they checked the next one, "Opera Concert Ticket in Rome with Dinner" which is $86.62, which is under 100. The user wanted to stop once they found one under 100, so this should be the one to recommend.

I need to present the details clearly. The name, price, description, and any important info like cancellation policy and what's included. Also, mention the price is under $100 as requested. Check if there are any other attractions to check, but since the second one already fits, no need to go further. Make sure to highlight the key points the user would care about: Opera theme, price under 100, and what's included in the ticket.
