Okay, let's break down what the user needs. They're staying at Hotel Route-Inn Sakaide-Kita Inter in Takamatsu with hotel_id 404817 and want attraction recommendations nearby, along with detailed descriptions.

First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function with the provided hotel_id. The response mentioned Takamatsu Symbol Tower as a nearby landmark. Next, I needed more details on this attraction. So, I used Search_Attraction_Location with "Takamatsu Symbol Tower" as the query. The result gave a productSlug, which I then used in Get_Attraction_Details to fetch the full description.

The final data shows that the main attraction is a Private Guided Shore Excursion from Takamatsu port. The details include the itinerary, such as making Sanuki Udon noodles, visiting Ritsurin Park, and enjoying the Seto Inland Sea view. The tour has free cancellation, is operated by MY Travel Consulting, and includes various amenities. I should present this information clearly, highlighting the key points like activities, inclusions, and practical info. Also, mention the distance from the hotel and maybe the rating if available. Make sure to format it in an easy-to-read way for the user.
