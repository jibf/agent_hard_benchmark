2025-08-13 21:32:31,805 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-62 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is looking for Harry Potter-themed attractions in London that cost under £100. The first attraction they checked was the Harry Potter's London Experience Tour, which is £395. That's way over 100, so they need to check the next ones.

The second attraction is the Self-Guided Audio Tour, which is £7.57. That's well under £100. The user's child is a fan, so maybe this is a good option. The description mentions visiting movie locations from various Harry Potter films, which sounds exciting. The tour is self-guided, so it's flexible, and the price is right. 

I should confirm if there are any other attractions under £100, but since the user said to stop once we find one under 100, and the second option is already under, maybe we can present this as the answer. However, the user might want more options. Let me check the other attractions from the initial search.

Looking back at the Search_Attraction_Location response, there are three more tours. Let me check their details quickly. The third one is a private car tour to London and Oxford, which might be more expensive. The fourth and fifth ones are walking tours; maybe their prices are in between. But since the second one is already under £100, maybe it's best to present that as the first option under 100. 

Wait, the user said "if the first one costs more than 100, keep checking the next ones until you find something under 100." The first one was 395, the second is 7.57. So the second is the first one under 100. Therefore, the answer should be the Self-Guided Audio Tour. Also, check if there are any other details the user might need, like cancellation policies, inclusions, etc. The audio tour includes lifetime access, offline maps, and the app, which is convenient.
