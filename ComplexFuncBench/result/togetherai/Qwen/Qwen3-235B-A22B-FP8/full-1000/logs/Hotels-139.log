Okay, let's break down the user's request. They're planning a trip to Tokyo from December 10th to 15th, 2024, with two adults and a three-year-old child. They want the two cheapest hotels that offer airport shuttle services and information on their child policies.

First, I need to find hotels in Tokyo for those dates. The user mentioned "cheapest," so sorting by price makes sense. But to search hotels, I need the destination ID. The function Search_Hotel_Destination can get that. I'll start by using that with the query "Tokyo."

Once I have the dest_id, I can use Search_Hotels. The parameters required are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, and departure_date. The user's dates are December 10th to 15th, so arrival is 2024-12-10 and departure 2024-12-15. Search_type might be "city" or similar, but since the user didn't specify, maybe the default from the Search_Hotel_Destination response will handle it. Also, they need airport shuttle services, which might be part of the categories_filter. But how to get that? The Get_Filter function can help, but the user mentioned "airport shuttle," which I'm not sure what the exact filter name is. Maybe the categories_filter has a code for amenities like shuttle service. However, the user might not know the exact code, so perhaps the initial search should include the categories_filter parameter once we get it from Get_Filter. But since the user specifically mentioned "airport shuttle," maybe it's a predefined filter. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function's categories_filter can be set to include that. But since the available functions don't have a direct way to specify amenities, maybe the categories_filter is used for that. However, the Get_Filter function's description says it's to get the categories_filter parameter value. So perhaps after getting the dest_id, I should call Get_Filter with the search_type and other parameters to get the correct categories_filter for airport shuttle. But the user's main goal is to find hotels with that service, so maybe the categories_filter needs to include that. However, without knowing the exact value, I might need to proceed step by step.

Wait, the user wants the two cheapest hotels with airport shuttle. So first, get the dest_id for Tokyo. Then, use Search_Hotels with sort_by as "price" to get the cheapest. But how to filter for airport shuttle? The categories_filter might be the way. So after getting dest_id, call Get_Filter to find the appropriate categories_filter that includes airport shuttle. But the Get_Filter function's parameters include search_type, dest_id, etc., and returns possible filters. However, the user might not know the exact filter value. Alternatively, maybe the categories_filter can be set to a specific value that represents airport shuttle. But since the function's documentation doesn't specify, perhaps the initial Search_Hotels call can be made with sort_by as price, and maybe the categories_filter left out, but then how to ensure airport shuttle? This is a bit unclear. Maybe the user's request can't be fully met with the given functions, but we can proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the airport shuttle is part of the hotel's amenities, and the categories_filter is used for that. Let me check the functions again. The Get_Filter function's description says it's to get the categories_filter parameter for Search_Hotels. So the process would be: first, get dest_id via Search_Hotel_Destination. Then, use Get_Filter with the search_type, dest_id, dates, etc., to get the categories_filter that includes airport shuttle. But how does the user specify "airport shuttle" in the Get_Filter? The Get_Filter's parameters don't include a way to specify amenities. Hmm, this is a problem. The available functions might not allow filtering by specific amenities like airport shuttle. The user might have to first search for hotels, then check each hotel's policies, including shuttle service. But the functions provided don't have a direct way to filter by amenities. This could be an issue. However, the user might have to proceed by first getting the list of hotels sorted by price, then for each hotel, check their policies via Property_Children_Policies (though that function only gives child policies, not shuttle service). Wait, the Property_Children_Policies function's description says it retrieves policies related to children, so it might not include shuttle service info. Therefore, the user's request to find hotels with airport shuttle might not be feasible with the given functions. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the shuttle service is part of the child policy, but that's unlikely. 

Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to first get the hotels sorted by price, then for each hotel, check if they have airport shuttle (but how?), but since the functions don't provide that info, maybe the child policy might mention it. Alternatively, the user might have to proceed with the available functions and then mention that the shuttle service can't be filtered via the API, so they need to check each hotel's details. But since the assistant can only use the given functions, maybe the best approach is to proceed with the Search_Hotels with sort_by price, and then use Property_Children_Policies to get the child policies, but the shuttle service might not be covered here. However, the user might have to be informed that filtering by shuttle isn't possible, but the assistant can only do what's available.

Alternatively, maybe the categories_filter can be set to a value that includes airport shuttle. For example, if the Get_Filter function returns possible categories_filter values, including one for shuttle service. But since the user hasn't called Get_Filter before, the initial call to Get_Filter would be needed. Let's outline the steps:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Tokyo" to get dest_id.
2. Use Get_Filter with search_type (from destination?), dest_id, dates, etc., to get categories_filter options. But how to specify airport shuttle here? The Get_Filter's parameters don't include a way to specify amenities. So maybe the categories_filter is a predefined set of filters, and the user has to select one. Without knowing the possible values, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, proceed without categories_filter and assume that the Search_Hotels will return hotels, and then check each hotel's policies. But the Search_Hotels function's response might include amenities like shuttle service. However, the function's parameters don't include a way to filter by that. So the assistant might have to proceed without filtering and then the user would have to manually check each hotel's amenities. But the user wants to find hotels that provide shuttle service, so this is a key point.

Given the functions provided, perhaps the assistant can only proceed with the available parameters and note that filtering by shuttle service isn't possible via the API. But the user's request is to find hotels with that service, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the initial steps and then explain that the shuttle service info isn't accessible through the current functions. However, the user might not know that. 

In this case, the assistant should proceed with the available steps:

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination to get the dest_id for Tokyo. Then, use Search_Hotels with sort_by price, and the given dates, dest_id, adults=2, children_age=3, room_qty=1 (assuming one room for two adults and a child). Then, from the results, get the top two hotels. Then, for each hotel_id, call Property_Children_Policies to get the child policies. However, the shuttle service info might not be available here. Therefore, the assistant can only address the child policies part, but not the shuttle service filtering. The user might need to be informed that the shuttle service can't be filtered via the API, but the child policies can be retrieved. 

But the user specifically asked for hotels that provide airport shuttle, so the assistant might need to proceed with the Search_Hotels without the categories_filter and then note that the shuttle service info isn't available through these functions. Alternatively, maybe the categories_filter can be set to a specific value that includes shuttle service. For example, if the Get_Filter function returns possible categories_filter values, and one of them is for airport shuttle. Let's see:

The Get_Filter function's parameters include categories_filter (which can be retrieved from the same endpoint), but the initial request should leave it blank. So perhaps calling Get_Filter with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, and other parameters would return possible filters, including one for airport shuttle. Then, the categories_filter can be set to that value in the Search_Hotels call. However, the assistant can't know the exact value without calling Get_Filter first. 

So the steps would be:

1. Search_Hotel_Destination("Tokyo") to get dest_id.
2. Call Get_Filter with search_type (from destination?), dest_id, dates, etc., to get possible categories_filter values, including airport shuttle.
3. Use that categories_filter in Search_Hotels along with sort_by price to get the cheapest hotels.
4. Then retrieve child policies for those hotels.

But since the assistant can't make multiple tool calls in one response, the initial step is to first call Search_Hotel_Destination. Then, in subsequent steps, proceed with Get_Filter, etc. However, the user's query requires a single tool call response. Wait, the user's instruction says "For each function call, return a json object..." implying that the assistant should make one tool call at a time. But in this case, the assistant needs to chain multiple calls. However, the user's current query requires the assistant to plan the steps and make the
