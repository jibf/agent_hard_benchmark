Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. They want the cheapest economy class flights for a multi-stop trip. The itinerary is San Francisco to Amsterdam on Dec 1, then Amsterdam to Prague on Dec 2, and returning to San Francisco on Dec 15. They also want flight details like baggage limits.

First, I need to find the flight options. The user mentioned a multi-stop journey, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is necessary. But before that, I need the correct airport IDs for the cities involved. San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Prague. So I should use the Search_Flight_Location function for each city to get their respective airport IDs.

Wait, the user didn't specify the airport codes, just the city names. So first, I should search for each location to get the correct IDs. Let me start with San Francisco. Using Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get its airport ID. Then do the same for Amsterdam and Prague.

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs for the multi-stop search. The legs array will have three entries: SFO to AMS on 2024-12-01, AMS to PRG on 2024-12-02, and PRG back to SFO on 2024-12-15. The cabin class is economy, and they want the cheapest option. The sort parameter should be CHEAPEST. 

After getting the flight search results, the next step is to retrieve the flight details using Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search results. This will provide baggage allowances and other details the user is interested in.

Wait, but the user mentioned "check the details of the flights" after searching. So the process is: first, get the flight options, then get the details for those flights. However, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function returns flight options, and each of those options would have a token. Then, to get details like baggage, the Get_Flight_Details function is called with that token.

But in the current setup, the user hasn't provided any tokens yet. So the first step is to perform the search, which will generate tokens for each flight option. Then, the assistant would need to use those tokens to fetch the details. However, since the user is asking to check the details, maybe the assistant should first perform the search, then use the token from the cheapest option to get the details.

But in the current tool setup, the assistant can only call the functions available. So the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. Once that's done, the response from that function will include tokens which can then be used in Get_Flight_Details.

But the user hasn't provided any tokens yet, so the initial step is to get the location IDs. Let me start with that. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, then Amsterdam, then Prague. Once I have the IDs, proceed to search flights with the multi-stop function. Then, after getting the flight options, use the token from the cheapest flight to get the details.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle all these steps. However, in the tool calling setup, each tool call is made in sequence based on the previous response. But since the assistant can't execute multiple steps in one response, it might need to first get the location IDs, then proceed to search flights, and then get the details. However, the user's message includes all the necessary info to start with the location search.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each of the three cities. Let's start with San Francisco. Then, once I have the IDs, proceed to the multi-stop flight search. Then, from the results, get the token of the cheapest flight and call Get_Flight_Details. But since the user wants the cheapest, maybe the sort parameter in the multi-stop search should be set to CHEAPEST.

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. However, the user's message requires multiple steps. But according to the instructions, the assistant should return the necessary tool calls in the order needed. However, the assistant might need to chain the calls. But in the initial response, the assistant can only make the first necessary tool call, which is to get the location IDs.

Wait, the user hasn't provided any IDs yet, so the first step is to get the airport IDs for the cities. So the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco. Then, once that's done, the next step would be to call it for Amsterdam, then Prague. Then, use those IDs in the multi-stop flight search. Then, after that, use the token from the search results to get the flight details.

But since the assistant can only return one tool call per turn, perhaps the first step is to get the location for San Francisco. However, the user's query includes all three cities, so maybe the assistant should make three separate calls to Search_Flight_Location for each city. But the system might require each tool call to be made in sequence. However, the assistant can only make one tool call in the response. Wait, the user's message is a single query, and the assistant needs to process all steps. But given the tool setup, the assistant must make each tool call one by one, but since the user's message includes all the necessary info, perhaps the assistant can chain the calls in a single response. However, according to the instructions, the assistant should return exactly one tool call per turn. Therefore, the first step is to get the location for San Francisco. Then, in the next turn, after the user provides the response, proceed to the next location, and so on. But since this is a single interaction, maybe the assistant should first call the Search_Flight_Location for all three cities in separate tool calls. However, the system might not allow multiple tool calls in one response. Wait, looking back at the tools instructions: "For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags." So each tool call is in its own XML tags. But the assistant can return multiple tool calls in one response? Or only one?

The initial instructions say: "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So multiple functions can be called. But the example shows one tool call. However, the user's query requires multiple steps. For example, first, get the IDs for all three cities. Then, search flights, then get details. But since each step depends on the previous, the assistant can't proceed to the next step without the prior data. Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location for each city. However, the assistant can make three separate tool calls in the same response. Let me check the example again. The example shows one tool call. So perhaps the assistant should make one tool call at a time. But the user's query requires multiple steps. Therefore, the assistant would first call Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, then in the next step (after the user provides the response), call it for Amsterdam, and so on. However, in this scenario, the assistant is supposed to generate the necessary tool calls in the initial response. But given that the user's message includes all the necessary info for all steps, perhaps the assistant can chain the tool calls. For example, first get the location IDs, then use them in the flight search, then get the details. But since the assistant can't execute the subsequent steps without the prior responses, the first step is to get the location IDs. Therefore, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city. However, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the same response. Let me check the tools instructions again. The user message is a single query, and the assistant must decide which function(s) to call. Since the user hasn't provided airport IDs, the first step is to get them via Search_Flight_Location. Since there are three cities, the assistant needs to call this function three times with each city's name. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, no. The assistant can make multiple tool calls in the same response. For example, if the assistant needs to search for all three locations, it can make three separate calls to Search_Flight_Location with each query. Then, once all three responses are obtained, proceed to the flight search. But according to the problem setup, the assistant can return multiple tool calls in the same response. Therefore, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Prague. Then, once those are done, use the IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, then use the token in Get_Flight_Details. However, the assistant's response can include multiple tool calls. But how does the system handle that? Maybe each tool call is processed sequentially, and the results are provided. However, the user's initial message requires all these steps. Therefore, the assistant's first step is to call the location search for all three cities. So in the response, three tool calls would be made. Then, after getting the IDs, proceed to the flight search. Then, get the flight details. But since the user wants the details, the assistant needs to chain all these calls. However, the assistant's response can only include the first necessary tool calls. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. So three separate tool calls. Then, in the next step, after receiving the IDs, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Then, from the results, call Get_Flight_Details. But since the user wants the cheapest economy flight, the assistant should structure the
