2025-08-13 21:24:37,146 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-26 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Forbidden City after seeing it on social media. Let me go through the steps I took to get the information.

First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with the query "Forbidden City". The response gave me a product slug, which is needed for the next step. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to retrieve detailed info.

Looking at the data from Get_Attraction_Details, there's a lot of information. The description mentions pre-booking tickets online to avoid long lines, which is a key point. The cancellation policy is free, which is good to note. The additional info includes accessibility issues and physical fitness requirements, important for travelers with specific needs. The reviews are mostly positive, highlighting ease of use and recommendations, but also some difficulties with the audio guide route.

I need to present this information clearly. Start with a brief overview, then break down the key details like booking options, what's included, cancellation, accessibility, and reviews. Make sure to mention the price and any important requirements like bringing a passport. Also, highlight the positive reviews but note the minor issues mentioned. Keep it concise but informative so the user gets all necessary details without being overwhelmed.
