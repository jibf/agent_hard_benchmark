Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. The user is staying at the DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort and wants to check sightseeing routes for attractions nearby, specifically for the day after tomorrow, which would be November 27th, 2024. They also want to reserve a taxi that picks them up three hours after the tour ends, taking them to Quebec City Jean Lesage International Airport.

First, I need to find the popular attractions near the hotel. The function Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires a hotel_id. To get that, I might need to search for the hotel first. However, the user didn't provide a hotel ID, so maybe I should use another function to get the hotel's details. Wait, looking at the tools provided, there's a Search_Hotel_Destination function that can find hotels by location. But the user already mentioned the hotel name, so perhaps there's a way to get the hotel_id by searching with the hotel's name. However, the available functions don't include a direct search by hotel name. Hmm, maybe the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function's description says that hotel_id can be retrieved from the searchHotels or searchHotelsByCoordinates endpoints. But since the user provided the hotel name, maybe I need to first use the Search_Hotel_Destination function with the hotel's name to get its coordinates or ID. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says it's to find hotels by their location, address, etc., and returns latitude and longitude. But how do I get the hotel_id from there? Maybe the response includes the hotel's ID. But since the user mentioned the hotel name, perhaps I can input the hotel's name as the query parameter for Search_Hotel_Destination. Once I get the hotel's details, I can extract the hotel_id from there. Wait, no, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response might give the coordinates, but not the hotel_id. This could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function can be called with the hotel_id obtained from another source. Since the user hasn't provided the hotel_id, and the assistant might not have access to look it up without the right function, perhaps there's a missing step here. But given the available tools, maybe the user expects that the hotel_id is known or can be inferred. Alternatively, maybe the hotel is in a specific location, and we can proceed by first getting the location details.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the assistant can use the hotel name to find the attractions nearby without the hotel_id. But according to the function definitions, Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id. So perhaps the assistant needs to first get the hotel_id. But how? The available functions for hotels are Search_Hotel_Destination (which searches by location query and returns coordinates) and the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By which needs hotel_id. There's no function listed that retrieves hotel details including hotel_id based on name. This seems like a gap. However, maybe the assistant can proceed by assuming that the hotel's name can be used as the query in Search_Hotel_Destination to get the hotel's coordinates, then use those coordinates in another function. Wait, but the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id, not coordinates. Hmm. This might be a problem. Maybe the assistant has to make an assumption here or there's a missing function. Since the user provided the hotel name, perhaps the assistant should first use Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel's name to get its location details, which might include the hotel_id. But according to the function's description, Search_Hotel_Destination returns latitude and longitude. If that's the case, then the assistant might need another function to get the hotel_id based on coordinates, but the available functions don't include that. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By can be called with the coordinates, but the function's parameters require hotel_id. This seems like a dead end. However, perhaps the assistant can proceed by using the hotel name as the query for Search_Hotel_Destination to get the coordinates, then use those coordinates in another function. Wait, but the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id. Maybe the assistant has to proceed with the assumption that the hotel_id can be retrieved through some means not explicitly covered here. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should proceed by first calling Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel's name to get its coordinates, then use those coordinates in another function to find attractions nearby. But the available functions don't have a way to get attractions by coordinates, only by hotel_id. Therefore, the assistant might be stuck here. However, given the problem, perhaps the assistant should proceed to call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with a placeholder hotel_id, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should inform the user that the hotel_id is needed, but since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the assistant should make an attempt to find it. Wait, perhaps the assistant can use the Search_Hotel_Destination function with the hotel's name to get the coordinates, then use those coordinates in the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function. But according to the function definitions, Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By requires hotel_id, not coordinates. Therefore, this might not be possible. This seems like a limitation in the provided tools. However, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available functions, even if there's a gap. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by first getting the hotel's coordinates via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use those coordinates in another function that's not listed here. But since the tools are fixed, the assistant must work with what's given. Therefore, perhaps the assistant should proceed by calling Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id, assuming that it can be retrieved somehow. But how? Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the assistant needs to make a function call to Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel's name to get the hotel's details. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says it's to find hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc., and returns latitude and longitude. It doesn't mention returning the hotel_id. Therefore, even after getting the coordinates, the assistant still doesn't have the hotel_id required for Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By. This seems like a dead end. However, perhaps the assistant can proceed to call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id as a placeholder, but that's not practical. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed to call the Taxi_Search_Location function for the airport and the hotel, then proceed to book the taxi. Let's look at the taxi part. The user wants to reserve a taxi to pick them up from the hotel three hours after the tour ends and take them to the airport. The taxi reservation requires drop_off_place_id and pick_up_place_id, which can be retrieved using Taxi_Search_Location. The pick_up_place_id would be the hotel's location, and the drop_off_place_id would be the airport. So, the assistant needs to first get the googlePlaceId for both the hotel and the airport. For that, the assistant can use the Taxi_Search_Location function. First, call Taxi_Search_Location with the query "DoubleTree by Hilton Quebec Resort" to get the pick_up_place_id. Then, call Taxi_Search_Location again with "Quebec City Jean Lesage International Airport" to get the drop_off_place_id. Once those are obtained, the assistant can proceed to call Search_Taxi with the pick_up and drop_off place IDs, along with the pick_up_date and time. The tour ends on November 27th (day after tomorrow), and the taxi should pick up three hours after the tour ends. However, the exact end time of the tour isn't specified. The user might assume that the tour ends at a certain time, but since it's not provided, the assistant might need to make an assumption or ask for clarification. However, since the user hasn't provided the tour end time, perhaps the assistant should proceed by setting the pick_up_time as three hours from the current time or the end of the day. But this is ambiguous. Alternatively, since the tour is on the day after tomorrow, the assistant might set the pick_up_date as November 27th and the pick_up_time as three hours after a typical tour end time, say 5 PM (assuming tours end at 2 PM, but this is a guess). However, without knowing the exact end time, this is speculative. The user might have intended that the taxi is booked three hours after the tour's end, but without knowing when the tour ends, the assistant might need to make an assumption. Alternatively, the assistant could proceed by using the current time plus three hours, but since the date is day after tomorrow, perhaps the assistant should set the time as 15:00 (3 PM) on November 27th. However, this is an assumption. 

Putting it all together, the steps would be:

1. Find the attractions near the hotel using Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By, which requires hotel_id. Since the hotel_id isn't provided, this step might not be possible with the given tools. However, perhaps the assistant can proceed to call Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel's name to get coordinates, but that doesn't give the hotel_id. Therefore, this function can't be used. This is a problem. Maybe the user expects that the assistant can find attractions near the hotel without the hotel_id, but according to the tools, that's not possible. Therefore, the assistant might have to skip this step or inform the user, but since the user asked for
