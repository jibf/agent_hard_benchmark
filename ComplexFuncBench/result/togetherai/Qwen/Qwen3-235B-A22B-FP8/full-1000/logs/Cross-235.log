Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. They want to book the cheapest flight from Toronto to Las Vegas on December 25, 2024, without overnight layovers. Then, they need a hotel near the Las Vegas Strip for four days, and a taxi from the airport to the hotel an hour after landing.

First, I need to find the flight. The user specified "cheapest," so I'll use the Search_Flights function with sort set to CHEAPEST. But before that, I need the location IDs for Toronto and Las Vegas airports. So I should first call Search_Flight_Location for both cities. Wait, but the user mentioned "Toronto" and "Las Vegas," so I need to get their airport codes. Let me check: the Search_Flight_Location function takes a query parameter. I'll call that for Toronto and then for Las Vegas to get their IDs.

Once I have fromId and toId, I can use Search_Flights with departDate as 2024-12-25, sort by CHEAPEST. Also, the user doesn't want overnight layovers, but the function parameters don't mention layover options. Hmm, maybe the API handles that automatically when sorting by cheapest, or perhaps the user's constraint might not be directly enforceable via the API. But since the function's parameters don't include layover options, I'll proceed with the available parameters and note that the user's preference might need to be checked post-results.

Next, the hotel booking. They want a hotel near Las Vegas Strip. So first, I need to get the dest_id for Las Vegas using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Las Vegas Strip." Then, use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date as 2024-12-25, departure_date as 2024-12-29 (four days stay), and sort_by price since they want the cheapest. Also, check if other parameters like room_qty or adults are needed, but the user didn't specify, so default to 1 adult and 1 room.

Then, the taxi. They need a taxi from the airport to the hotel an hour after the flight lands. So first, get the googlePlaceIds for both the airport (Las Vegas McCarran Airport) and the hotel. But how? The user hasn't specified the hotel name yet. Wait, the hotel booking would come after the flight search, but the taxi requires both pick-up and drop-off locations. This is a problem because the hotel isn't booked yet. Maybe the user expects that after getting the flight and hotel options, the taxi can be arranged once the hotel is selected. But since the user is asking to book all three, perhaps the process is to first get flight options, then hotel options, and then use the hotel's address to get the drop-off Place ID for the taxi. However, the user's instruction is to book all, so maybe the assistant needs to proceed step by step, first getting flight info, then hotel, then taxi. But since the taxi requires the hotel's Place ID, which isn't known yet, perhaps the assistant should first get the flight and hotel, then use the hotel's address to get the Place ID for the taxi. However, the user's message is a single request, so the assistant might need to make multiple function calls in sequence, using the outputs of each step to proceed.

But given the tools available, the assistant can only call the functions as per the provided APIs. Let's outline the steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get the departure airport ID (fromId).
2. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Las Vegas" to get the arrival airport ID (toId).
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-25, sort=CHEAPEST to get the cheapest flight. Check if the flight's arrival time allows for a taxi booking an hour after landing. However, the exact arrival time isn't known until the flight is booked, which complicates the taxi booking. But the user might be okay with providing the taxi pick-up time based on the flight's scheduled arrival plus one hour. However, the taxi requires pick_up_date and pick_up_time. Since the flight's arrival time is part of the flight data, the assistant would need to get that from the flight search results. But since we can't execute multiple steps in one go, perhaps the assistant should first get the flight details, then proceed to the hotel and taxi. However, the user wants all three booked, so the assistant might need to make multiple tool calls, using the outputs from each to proceed.

But in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to call the necessary functions based on the user's initial request. Since the assistant can't perform multiple steps interactively, perhaps the best approach is to first get the flight, then the hotel, then the taxi, each in separate tool calls, using the outputs from each previous step.

However, the user's message is a single query, so the assistant must generate all necessary tool calls in sequence, even if they depend on previous outputs. But in the context of the given tools, the assistant can only call the functions available, and the actual execution would be handled by the backend, which can chain the calls. Therefore, the assistant should structure the tool calls in the order needed, using placeholders where necessary.

Wait, but the assistant can't know the exact flight arrival time until the flight search is done, which affects the taxi's pick-up time. Similarly, the hotel's address isn't known until the hotel is booked, which affects the taxi's drop-off location. Therefore, the assistant should first call the flight search, then the hotel search, then the taxi search, each depending on the previous step's output. However, since the user is asking to book all, the assistant must generate the necessary tool calls in order, even if they depend on prior steps.

But in the current setup, the assistant is to output the tool calls based on the initial query. Therefore, the assistant must make the necessary function calls, even if some parameters are not yet known. However, the parameters must be filled with the available data. For example, the flight search requires fromId and toId, which can be obtained by first calling Search_Flight_Location for Toronto and Las Vegas.

So, the first step is to get the location IDs for Toronto and Las Vegas airports. Then, use those IDs to search for flights. Then, once the flight's arrival time is known, book the taxi. But since the assistant can't execute these steps in sequence in a single response, perhaps the assistant should first call the Search_Flight_Location for both cities, then proceed to search flights, then hotel, then taxi. However, the user's request is to book all, so the assistant must generate all necessary tool calls, even if they depend on prior calls.

But the assistant's response can only include the tool calls it can make based on the user's input, without knowing the intermediate results. Therefore, the assistant must make the first necessary calls, such as Search_Flight_Location for Toronto and Las Vegas, then once those IDs are obtained, proceed to Search_Flights. Similarly, for the hotel, use Search_Hotel_Destination for Las Vegas Strip, then Search_Hotels. For the taxi, use Taxi_Search_Location for both the airport and hotel to get their Place IDs, then Search_Taxi.

But given the user's message, the assistant must generate the required tool calls in order. Let's outline the steps:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get the departure airport's ID.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Las Vegas" to get the arrival airport's ID.
3. Use the obtained fromId and toId in Search_Flights with departDate=2024-12-25, sort=CHEAPEST.
4. Then, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Las Vegas Strip" to get the dest_id.
5. Use the dest_id in Search_Hotels with arrival_date=2024-12-25, departure_date=2024-12-29 (4 days), sort_by=price.
6. For the taxi, first get the Las Vegas airport's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location with query "Las Vegas Airport".
7. Get the hotel's googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location with query as the hotel's name (but since the hotel isn't selected yet, this might not be possible; perhaps the user expects the hotel to be selected first, but this complicates things).
8. Then, use the obtained Place IDs in Search_Taxi with pick_up_date=2024-12-25 and pick_up_time as flight arrival time + 1 hour.

However, the exact flight arrival time isn't known until the flight search is done. Similarly, the hotel's address isn't known until the hotel is booked. This creates dependencies that the assistant can't resolve in a single pass. Therefore, the assistant should proceed step by step, first getting the flight locations, then flight details, then hotel locations, then hotel details, then taxi locations based on flight and hotel results.

But given the tools, the assistant can only make the initial calls to get the location IDs. The rest would require the backend to handle the chaining. Therefore, the assistant's first step is to call the necessary search functions to get the IDs for the flight, hotel, and taxi.

So, the first tool calls would be:

- Search_Flight_Location for Toronto (to get fromId)
- Search_Flight_Location for Las Vegas (to get toId)
- Search_Hotel_Destination for Las Vegas Strip (to get dest_id)
- Taxi_Search_Location for Las Vegas
