Okay, let's see. The user wants to travel to Miami and Orlando, stay 5 days each, then return to Washington. They're flexible on the order of Miami and Orlando. They need the cheapest flight around December 18th, 2024, and details on that flight.

First, I need to figure out the possible itineraries. Since they can go Miami first or Orlando first, there are two possible routes. Let's break it down.

The user is starting from Washington. So the first leg would be Washington to either Miami or Orlando. Then after 5 days, they go from the first city to the second. Then after another 5 days, they return to Washington from the second city.

But since the departure date is around December 18th, maybe the trip starts on the 18th. Wait, but the user says "departure date of the cheapest flight around December 18th". So the departure date is the first flight's date. The return would be after 10 days (5+5 days), so around December 28th. But the user might be looking for the outbound flight around the 18th, and the return around the 28th. However, the exact dates might vary depending on the order of the cities.

But since the user hasn't decided the order, we need to check both possibilities: Washington to Miami first, then Miami to Orlando, then Orlando to Washington. Or Washington to Orlando first, then Orlando to Miami, then Miami to Washington.

But how to find the cheapest multi-stop flight? The user mentioned "cheapest flight around December 18th", so the departure date is around the 18th. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function can be used here. This function returns the minimum price for multi-stop flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if we set the date as December 18th, it will check from December 13th to December 23rd for the first leg. But the user wants the departure date to be around the 18th, so maybe the best approach is to check both possible orders (Miami first and Orlando first) and find which combination gives the cheapest total price.

Wait, but the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function will return the minimum price for a given set of legs. Each leg has a date. However, the dates might vary because the first leg's date affects the subsequent legs. For example, if the first leg is on the 18th, the second leg would be 5 days later (23rd), and the return on the 28th. But if the first leg is on the 18th, but the cheapest option might have a different date. However, the user wants the departure date to be around the 18th, so maybe the first leg's date should be around that.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function allows us to get the minimum price within 5 days before and after the specified date. So if we pass the legs with dates as December 18th, December 23rd, and December 28th (assuming 5 days stay each), the API will check the cheapest options for those legs within the date ranges. However, the user hasn't fixed the order of the cities, so we need to check both possible orders.

So first, I need to get the location IDs for Washington, Miami, and Orlando airports. The Search_Flight_Location function can be used here. Let's start by getting the IDs for each city.

Wait, but the user might not have provided the exact departure city. The user says "return to Washington", so the origin is Washington. So first, I need to get the location IDs for Washington, Miami, and Orlando airports.

So step 1: Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

But since the user might be departing from Washington, I need to find the airport code for Washington. Similarly for Miami and Orlando.

Let me start by calling Search_Flight_Location for each of these cities.

First, for Washington:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Washington".

Then for Miami: query "Miami".

Then for Orlando: query "Orlando".

Once I have the IDs, I can then create the two possible leg combinations:

Option 1:
Leg 1: Washington (fromId) to Miami (toId), date around 18th Dec.
Leg 2: Miami (fromId) to Orlando (toId), date 5 days after Leg 1.
Leg 3: Orlando (fromId) to Washington (toId), date 5 days after Leg 2.

Option 2:
Leg 1: Washington (fromId) to Orlando (toId), date around 18th Dec.
Leg 2: Orlando (fromId) to Miami (toId), date 5 days after Leg 1.
Leg 3: Miami (fromId) to Washington (toId), date 5 days after Leg 2.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function requires the legs array with dates. However, the dates for the subsequent legs would depend on the first leg's date. But since the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function looks for the minimum price within 5 days before and after each specified date, perhaps we can set the dates as 18th, 23rd, and 28th (assuming 5 days stay each). The API will then check the cheapest options around those dates.

But the user wants the departure date (first leg's date) to be around the 18th. So the first leg's date is set to 2024-12-18. The second leg's date would be 2024-12-23 (5 days later), and the third leg's date would be 2024-12-28 (another 5 days). However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will check 5 days before and after each date, so the actual dates might vary, but the user wants the departure to be around the 18th. So perhaps the initial dates are set to 18th, 23rd, 28th, and the API will find the cheapest within those ranges.

So first, I need to get the location IDs for Washington, Miami, and Orlando.

Once I have the IDs, I can call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for both options (Miami first and Orlando first) to get the minimum prices. Then compare which option is cheaper.

But since the user hasn't decided the order, I need to check both possibilities.

So first, let's get the location IDs.

Call Search_Flight_Location for each city:

1. Washington:
{"name": "Search_Flight_Location", "arguments": {"query": "Washington"}}

2. Miami:
{"name": "Search_Flight_Location", "arguments": {"query": "Miami"}}

3. Orlando:
{"name": "Search_Flight_Location", "arguments": {"query": "Orlando"}}

Once I have the IDs, I can proceed to call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for both options.

Assuming the IDs are:

Washington: WAS.AIRPORT
Miami: MIA.AIRPORT
Orlando: ORL.AIRPORT

Then for Option 1:

Legs = [
  {"fromId": "WAS.AIRPORT", "toId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-18"},
  {"fromId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "toId": "ORL.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-23"},
  {"fromId": "ORL.AIRPORT", "toId": "WAS.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-28"}
]

Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with these legs.

For Option 2:

Legs = [
  {"fromId": "WAS.AIRPORT", "toId": "ORL.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-18"},
  {"fromId": "ORL.AIRPORT", "toId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-23"},
  {"fromId": "MIA.AIRPORT", "toId": "WAS.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-28"}
]

Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops again.

Compare the minimum prices from both options and find which is cheaper.

Once the cheapest option is found, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flights around the dates to find the specific flight details. Then use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info for that flight.

But the user wants the departure date of the cheapest flight around December 18th. So after getting the minimum price, maybe the next step is to search for flights on the specific dates (or nearby) that give the cheapest price and then get the details.

But the process might involve multiple steps. However, the user's request is to find the departure date (so the date of the first leg) of the cheapest flight around December 18th, and provide detailed info for that flight.

So the steps would be:

1. Get location IDs for Washington, Miami, Orlando.

2. For both possible orders (Miami first or Orlando first), call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the minimum price. Determine which order is cheaper.

3. Once the cheaper option is identified, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the corresponding legs (with dates adjusted if necessary) to find the
