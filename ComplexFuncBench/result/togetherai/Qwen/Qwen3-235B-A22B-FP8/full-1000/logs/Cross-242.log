Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. They want to book a hotel near Westminster Abbey for November 10, 2024, and then arrange a taxi from the hotel to Imperial College at 10 AM the next day. 

First, I need to find the right tools. The user mentioned two main tasks: hotel booking and taxi arrangement. Let's start with the hotel. The available functions include Search_Hotels and Search_Hotel_Destination. Since the user specified a location (Westminster Abbey), I should first use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the destination ID for Westminster Abbey. That will give me the necessary dest_id parameter for the hotel search.

Once I have the dest_id, I can use Search_Hotels with the arrival_date as 2024-11-10 and departure_date as 2024-11-11 (since they need the taxi the next day). The other parameters like adults, room_qty can be set to default unless specified, but the user didn't mention those, so I'll stick with defaults.

Next, for the taxi. The user wants to book a taxi from the hotel to Imperial College. To do that, I need the pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. But since the hotel is near Westminster Abbey, maybe the pick_up_place_id would be the same as the hotel's location. However, the hotel search might return a specific location, but the function requires using Taxi_Search_Location to get the googlePlaceId for both locations. Wait, the user hasn't specified the exact hotel yet, just the area. So I need to first get the googlePlaceId for both Westminster Abbey (as the pick-up location) and Imperial College (as the drop-off). 

Wait, the user said "near the Westminster Abbey" for the hotel. So the hotel's location would be in that area, but to get the exact googlePlaceId for the hotel, maybe after searching for the destination, the hotel's address can be used. But the Taxi_Search_Location function is needed to find the googlePlaceId for both the hotel's area and Imperial College. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination can give the coordinates, but the taxi function requires googlePlaceId. So I need to use Taxi_Search_Location for both locations. 

So first, I'll use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Westminster Abbey" to get the destination ID for the hotel. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels to find hotels there. Once that's done, I need to get the googlePlaceId for both the hotel's location (Westminster Abbey) and Imperial College. But since the user hasn't selected a specific hotel yet, maybe the pick-up location for the taxi is the area around Westminster Abbey. However, the Taxi_Search_Location function can be used to get the googlePlaceId for "Westminster Abbey" and "Imperial College". Then, use those IDs in the Taxi_Search function with the pick_up_date as 2024-11-11 and pick_up_time as 10:00.

Wait, the user wants to book the taxi in advance. So the steps are:

1. Find hotels near Westminster Abbey for the dates.
2. Once the hotel is selected (even though not booked yet), get the exact location (googlePlaceId) for the hotel and Imperial College.
3. Then, search for taxis using those IDs and the time.

But since the user is asking for advance planning, they might not have a specific hotel yet. So perhaps the first step is to get the googlePlaceId for Westminster Abbey and Imperial College using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, proceed with the hotel search. However, the hotel search requires dest_id, which comes from Search_Hotel_Destination. 

So the order of operations should be:

- Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Westminster Abbey" to get the dest_id.
- Use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-11.
- Separately, use Taxi_Search_Location for "Westminster Abbey" to get pick_up_place_id and "Imperial College" to get drop_off_place_id.
- Then, use those place IDs in Taxi_Search with pick_up_date 2024-11-11 and pick_up_time 10:00.

But the user might not have selected a specific hotel yet, so the pick_up_place_id is just the general area of Westminster Abbey. The taxi service would need the exact location, but since the hotel is near there, the googlePlaceId for Westminster Abbey itself might suffice for planning purposes. 

So first, I need to call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Westminster Abbey" to get the dest_id. Then, call Taxi_Search_Location for both "Westminster Abbey" and "Imperial College" to get their googlePlaceIds. Then, proceed with the hotel search and taxi search. 

Wait, but the user hasn't mentioned any specific preferences for the hotel, like price range or amenities. So the Search_Hotels can be called with the dest_id, arrival and departure dates, and default parameters for adults and room quantity. 

Putting it all together, the first step is to get the destination ID for Westminster Abbey using Search_Hotel_Destination. Then, get the googlePlaceIds using Taxi_Search_Location for both locations. Then, proceed with the hotel and taxi searches. 

But the user's query requires me to call the functions in the correct order. Since the user hasn't provided any specific IDs yet, I need to first get those via the search functions. 

So the first tool call should be to Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Westminster Abbey". Then, call Taxi_Search_Location for both "Westminster Abbey" and "Imperial College". Then, use those IDs to search hotels and taxis. 

However, the user's initial request is to help them find a hotel and book a taxi. So the assistant should first get the necessary location IDs and then proceed with the searches. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Hotel_Destination for Westminster Abbey. Then, two Taxi_Search_Location calls for Westminster Abbey and Imperial College. Then, use the dest_id from the hotel search in Search_Hotels, and the place IDs from the taxi location searches in Taxi_Search. 

But according to the problem statement, I need to output the tool calls in order. Since the user hasn't provided any prior information, the first step is to get the location data. 

Wait, but the user might not have provided all the parameters. For example, in Search_Hotels, the required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. The search_type can be obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination as well? Or is search_type a different parameter? The Search_Hotel_Destination's response includes the search_type? The description says "search_type can be retrieved from Search Hotel Destination endpoint". So after calling Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Westminster Abbey", the response should include the search_type. 

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Westminster Abbey" to get dest_id and search_type.
2. Call Taxi_Search_Location for "Westminster Abbey" and "Imperial College" to get their googlePlaceIds.
3. Use the dest_id and search_type from step 1 in Search_Hotels with arrival_date 2024-11-10, departure_date 2024-11-11.
4. Use the googlePlaceIds from step 2 in Taxi_Search with pick_up_date 2024-11-11 and pick_up_time 10:00.

So the first tool call is to Search_Hotel_Destination. Then, Taxi_Search_Location for both locations. Then, proceed with the hotel and taxi searches. However, the user's query requires me to output the tool calls in sequence. Since the assistant can't do multiple steps at once, but the user is asking for planning, the assistant should generate the necessary tool calls in order, possibly in multiple steps. But according to the problem, I need to output the tool calls needed to fulfill the request. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant should determine which functions to call first. Since the functions require parameters that are obtained from other functions, the assistant must chain the calls. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Hotel_Destination for Westminster Abbey. Then, two Taxi_Search_Location calls. Then, the Search_Hotels and Taxi_Search. However, the problem states that for each turn, the assistant can call one or more functions. But in this case, the assistant would need to first get the location IDs before proceeding. 

But the user is asking for advance planning, so the assistant should outline all necessary steps. However, the current task is to output the tool calls needed. So the assistant should first call Search_Hotel_Destination, then Taxi_Search_Location for both locations, then Search_Hotels and Taxi_Search. 

But since the assistant can only call functions based on the current information, the first step is to call Search_Hotel_Destination and Taxi_Search_Location for both locations. 

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact parameters. Let me check the required parameters for each function.

For Search_Hotels, required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So to call Search_Hotels, we need search_type and dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination.

For Taxi_Search, required parameters are drop_off_place_id, pick_up_place_id, pick_up_time, pick_up_date. The place_ids come from Taxi_Search_Location.

Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Hotel
