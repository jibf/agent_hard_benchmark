2025-08-13 21:24:54,231 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-28 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about Tokyo Tower after seeing it on social media. First, I needed to find the right attraction using the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Tokyo Tower" as the query. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details function to get all the specifics.

Now, looking at the data from the tool response, the attraction is called "Red Tokyo Tower Night Ticket." The description mentions it's a digital playground with high-tech attractions like AR bouldering, VR rides, and a robot fight (with an extra fee). It's suitable for all ages but has some health restrictions. The price is $25.29 USD, and there's a free cancellation policy. The user might want a summary that highlights the key features, what's included, pricing, and any important terms. I should present this info clearly, making sure to mention the unique attractions and any warnings or requirements they should know about before booking.
