Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. They want to book a flight, a hotel, and a taxi. 

First, the flight from Toronto to San Francisco on December 15, 2024. They specified the best flight without overnight layovers. So I need to use the Search_Flights function. I'll need the departure and arrival airport IDs. The user didn't mention specific airports, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location function for both cities to get the IDs. For Toronto, query "Toronto" and get the id. Similarly for San Francisco. Then, use Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST to minimize layovers, set departDate as 2024-12-15. The returnDate isn't mentioned, so maybe it's a one-way trip? Wait, the hotel is for three days, so the flight is likely one-way. But the Search_Flights function requires returnDate if it's a round trip. Wait, the user says "book the best flight" and "book a hotel for three-day stay". So maybe the flight is one-way, and the return flight is on the 18th? But the user didn't specify return date. Hmm, but the taxi is needed one hour after the flight lands, so the flight arrival time is important. But the Search_Flights parameters include returnDate. Wait, looking at the parameters for Search_Flights, returnDate is not in the required list. The required are toId, fromId, departDate. So maybe the returnDate is optional. So the user is asking for a one-way flight. But the function might allow for a one-way by not providing returnDate. So proceed with departDate=2024-12-15, and no returnDate. But the user's hotel is for three days, so maybe the return flight is on the 18th. Wait, but the user didn't mention booking a return flight. They just want to book the flight from Toronto to SF and then the hotel for three days, and a taxi from airport to hotel. So perhaps the flight is one-way, and the return is not part of this booking. So proceed with one-way flight.

Next, the hotel near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get the dest_id. Then use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date as 2024-12-15, departure_date as 2024-12-18 (three days stay), room_qty=1, adults=1 (unless specified otherwise, but user didn't mention number of guests, so default to 1 adult). Sort by distance or popularity? The user wants it near Golden Gate Park, so maybe sort by distance. So sort_by="distance".

Then, the taxi from airport to hotel one hour after flight lands. Need to get the flight arrival time to determine pick_up_time. But the flight search results will have the arrival time. However, since we can't execute the API calls here, we need to assume that once the flight is booked, the arrival time is known. Then, the pick_up_time for the taxi would be arrival_time + 1 hour. But since we can't know the exact time yet, the taxi booking would require the pick_up_date as 2024-12-15 (same as flight arrival date) and pick_up_time as arrival_time + 1 hour. However, without knowing the flight's actual arrival time, we can't set the exact time. But the user's instruction is to book the taxi one hour after the flight lands, so the pick_up_time would be flight arrival time + 1 hour. But since we can't execute the APIs in sequence here, we need to structure the calls in a way that the flight search is done first, then the taxi uses the flight's arrival time. However, in the context of this problem, we need to generate the tool calls in order. So first, get the flight location IDs, then search flights, then get the hotel destination, search hotels, then get taxi locations (airport and hotel), then search taxi. But the user's request is to book all three: flight, hotel, taxi. So the assistant needs to make all necessary function calls. However, the user might need to provide more info after each step, but according to the problem, we need to generate the tool calls based on the given info.

Wait, the Taxi requires pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. The pick_up is the airport in San Francisco, and the drop-off is the hotel near Golden Gate Park. So first, get the airport's googlePlaceId for San Francisco airport. Use Taxi_Search_Location with query "San Francisco Airport" to get the drop_off_place_id (since the taxi is from the airport, so the airport is the pick-up place). Wait, the flight arrives at San Francisco airport, so the taxi's pick_up_place_id is the airport's googlePlaceId, and the drop_off_place_id is the hotel's location. But how to get the hotel's googlePlaceId? The hotel search might not provide that. Alternatively, the user might need to specify the hotel address, but in this case, the user just wants a hotel near Golden Gate Park. So perhaps the drop_off_place_id is the Golden Gate Park's place ID. Use Taxi_Search_Location with query "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get the drop_off_place_id. But the hotel might not be exactly there, but the user said "near Golden Gate Park", so using the park's place ID as an approximation. Alternatively, the hotel's address would be known after booking, but since we can't do that, maybe the assistant has to proceed with the available info.

Putting it all together:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get fromId.
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco to get toId.
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-15, sort=FASTEST to get the flight details. Assume the flight arrives on the same day (no overnight layover), so arrival_time can be extracted from the flight details. Let's say the flight arrives at 5:00 PM. Then pick_up_time for taxi is 6:00 PM.
4. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for Golden Gate Park, San Francisco to get dest_id.
5. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date=2024-12-15, departure_date=2024-12-18, sort_by=distance.
6. Use Taxi_Search_Location for San Francisco Airport to get pick_up_place_id.
7. Use Taxi_Search_Location for Golden Gate Park to get drop_off_place_id.
8. Use Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id, drop_off_place_id, pick_up_date=2024-12-15, pick_up_time= (flight arrival time + 1 hour). Since the flight arrival time isn't known yet, but the user says "one hour after the flight lands", the pick_up_time would be flight's arrival time plus one hour. However, without knowing the flight's exact arrival time, the assistant might need to proceed with the available info, perhaps using a placeholder, but in the context of the tool calls, the actual time would be determined after the flight search. But since we can't execute the APIs here, the assistant would generate the necessary tool calls in order, assuming that the flight's arrival time is known.

But according to the problem, the assistant needs to generate the tool calls based on the user's initial request, so the order would be:

First, get the flight location IDs, then search flights, then get hotel destination, search hotels, then get taxi locations and search taxi. However, since the taxi's pick_up_time depends on the flight's arrival time, which isn't known until the flight search is done, the assistant might need to make the flight search first, then use that info for the taxi. But in the tool calls, each step is a separate function call. So the assistant would first call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto and San Francisco to get the IDs, then Search_Flights, then from the flight results, get the arrival time, then compute pick_up_time, then call Taxi_Search_Location for the airport and hotel area, then Search_Taxi.

But since the user's message is a single request, the assistant has to generate all necessary tool calls in sequence, even if some depend on previous results. However, in the tool calls, each function call must be made with the available parameters. So the assistant would need to first get the flight location IDs, then the flight details, then the hotel destination, then the hotel search, then the taxi locations, then the taxi search. But since the user hasn't provided all the parameters, the assistant has to infer or use the available functions to get the required parameters.

So, step by step:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get toId.
3. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-15, sort=FASTEST to get flight details. From this, get the flight's arrival time. Let's assume the flight arrives at 18:00 (6 PM).
4. Then, pick_up_time for taxi is 19:00 (7 PM), same day.
5. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get dest_id.
6. Call Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival
