Okay, let's see. The user asked for tour routes in Beijing and detailed info on sightseeing activities. I started by using the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Beijing" as the query. That gave me a destination ID. Then I used Search_Attractions with that ID sorted by popularity, which returned a list of attractions, including the Forbidden City tour. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from that tour to get more specifics.

Now, the user probably wants a summary of the available tours, focusing on the Forbidden City one since it's the most popular. I should present the key details like the name, description, price, cancellation policy, and what's included. Also, mention the meeting point and any important notes like the need for passports. The reviews are mixed, so maybe highlight the positive ones and note the average rating. Make sure to structure the information clearly so it's easy to read. Let me check if there are other attractions from the Search_Attractions response, but since the user asked for detailed info, focusing on the top result makes sense. Alright, time to compile all this into a coherent response.
