Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want two things: detailed info on the fastest flight from Chengdu to San Francisco on December 20, 2024, and hotel availability within 50 km of the airport that day.

First, I need to find the flight. The user specified "fastest," so I'll use the Search_Flights function with sort set to FASTEST. I need the departure and arrival airport IDs. Since the user mentioned Chengdu and San Francisco, I should first get their airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location. Wait, but the user didn't specify the airport codes, just the cities. So maybe I should first call Search_Flight_Location for both cities to get their IDs. But wait, the Search_Flights function requires fromId and toId. So step one: get the location IDs for Chengdu and San Francisco.

Wait, but the user might not know the exact airport codes. So I should first use Search_Flight_Location with query "Chengdu" and "San Francisco" to get the correct IDs. Let me check the parameters for Search_Flight_Location. It takes a query parameter, which can be city names. So I'll need to call that function twice, once for each city, to get their respective IDs.

Once I have the fromId and toId, then I can call Search_Flights with departDate as 2024-12-20, sort by FASTEST. Then, from the search results, get the token for the fastest flight and use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info.

Next, the hotel part. The user wants hotels within 50 km of the airport (San Francisco airport, I assume). So first, I need the coordinates of San Francisco airport. To get that, I can use Location_to_Lat_Long with query as San Francisco airport. Wait, but maybe the Search_Flight_Location gives the coordinates as well? Let me check. The Search_Flight_Location's response isn't specified here, but the function's purpose is to find airports by location. So maybe after getting the toId (San Francisco's airport ID), I can get the coordinates from that response? Hmm, but the parameters for Search_Flight_Location only return the id. Wait, the function's description says "query can be names of airport, locations, etc." So maybe when I search for San Francisco airport using Search_Flight_Location, the response includes the coordinates. But since the tool's parameters don't mention that, maybe I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Flight_Details includes the airport's coordinates. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps after getting the toId, I can use another function to get the airport's details, but the available tools don't have that. So perhaps the safest way is to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport's name. For example, query "San Francisco International Airport" to get its coordinates.

But the user said "within 50 kilometers of the airport", so I need the coordinates of the airport. So steps: after getting the toId (San Francisco's airport ID), maybe use that to get the airport's name, then use Location_to_Lat_Long to get its coordinates. But how? Wait, the Search_Flight_Location's response might include the airport's name or coordinates. But since the tool's parameters for Search_Flight_Location only return the id, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Flight_Details includes the airport details. Hmm, this part is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

Assuming that after getting the flight details, the arrival airport's information might be included, but the tools don't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the toId from Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco would be the airport's ID, and maybe the name can be derived from that. Alternatively, maybe I should first get the airport's coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long with the city name. Wait, but the user wants hotels near the airport, not the city center. So better to get the airport's exact coordinates.

So perhaps after getting the flight info, the arrival airport's coordinates are needed. But without knowing the exact functions' responses, it's tricky. Since the available tools don't have a function to get airport details by ID, maybe I need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed step by step.

First, get the fromId and toId for Chengdu and San Francisco using Search_Flight_Location. Then, search for flights. Then, get flight details. Then, get the coordinates of the destination airport (San Francisco) using the toId. Wait, but how? Maybe the Search_Flight_Location's response includes the coordinates when querying for the airport. Let me check the parameters for Search_Flight_Location. The parameters only take a query string, and the description says it returns id. So perhaps the response includes more data, like coordinates. But since the tool's parameters don't specify that, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long function can be used with the airport's name. For example, if the airport is San Francisco International Airport (SFO), then querying "San Francisco International Airport" in Location_to_Lat_Long would give its coordinates.

So steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Chengdu" to get fromId.
2. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get toId.
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-20, sort=FASTEST.
4. From the search results, get the token of the fastest flight and call Get_Flight_Details.
5. Then, to find hotels near San Francisco airport, use Location_to_Lat_Long with query "San Francisco International Airport" to get latitude and longitude.
6. Then, use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-12-20, departure_date=2024-12-20 (assuming check-out is same day?), radius=50 km, and the coordinates obtained.

Wait, but the user said "availability of hotels within 50 kilometers of the airport on that day". The departure date for the flight is December 20, 2024, which would be the arrival date for the hotel. But hotels typically require check-in and check-out dates. If the user is arriving on the 20th, they might check in on the 20th and check out on the 21st. But the user's query says "on that day", so maybe arrival and departure dates are the same? Or perhaps the user is looking for availability on the day of arrival, so maybe arrival_date=2024-12-20 and departure_date=2024-12-21. But the user's instruction isn't clear. However, the user's original query says "availability of hotels ... on that day", which is December 20. So perhaps the arrival and departure dates are both on the 20th? But that's not typical. Maybe the user wants hotels available for check-in on the 20th. So arrival_date=2024-12-20 and departure_date=2024-12-21. But since the user didn't specify, I'll have to make an assumption here.

Putting that aside for a moment, the main steps are:

- Get flight info via Search_Flights and Get_Flight_Details.
- Get hotel availability near the destination airport using Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates.

But to get the coordinates for the airport, I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long. However, the exact query for that might be the airport's name. So after getting the toId from Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, perhaps the airport's name is known (like San Francisco International Airport), so the query would be that name. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location's response includes the airport's name. But since the tool's parameters don't specify, I can't be sure. So perhaps the user needs to make a best guess here.

In summary, the tool calls needed are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Chengdu to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco to get toId.
3. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, sort=FASTEST.
4. Get_Flight_Details using the token from the search results.
5. Location_to_Lat_Long for San Francisco airport to get coordinates.
6. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the coordinates, arrival and departure dates, radius=50.

But since the user might not have provided the airport names, but just the cities, maybe the hotel search should be based on the city's coordinates. However, the user specified "within 50 kilometers of the airport", so it's definitely the airport's coordinates needed.

Now, considering that the user might not have the airport names, but since we have toId from the flight search, maybe the flight's destination is an airport with a known name. For example, San Francisco's main airport is SFO. So using "San Francisco International Airport" as the query for Location_to_Lat_Long.

But in the absence of knowing the exact airport name, perhaps the Search_Flight_Location's response would include the airport name. But since the tool's parameters don't include that, I can't be sure. So perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available functions, making necessary assumptions.

Putting it all together, the tool calls would be:

First, get the from and to location IDs.

Then, search flights.

Then, get flight details.

Then, get coordinates of the destination airport.

Then, search hotels by coordinates.

But each step depends on
