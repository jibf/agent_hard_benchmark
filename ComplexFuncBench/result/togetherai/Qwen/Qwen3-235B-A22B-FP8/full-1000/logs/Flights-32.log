Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They need to find the best economy class flights for a trip from London to Paris and Berlin, staying a week in each, and returning to London on December 15th, 2024. The user also wants detailed flight information and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey starts in London (LON) to Paris (PAR), then Paris to Berlin (BER), and finally Berlin back to London. The dates would be December 1st, December 8th, and December 15th respectively. 

Since the user mentioned multi-stop flights, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is appropriate here. The legs array should include each segment with fromId, toId, and date. I'll need to get the airport codes for London, Paris, and Berlin using the Search_Flight_Location function. 

Wait, the user didn't specify the exact airports, so I should first search for the location IDs. For example, querying "London" to get its airport ID, then Paris, then Berlin. But the user might not have provided that info, so I need to assume standard airport codes or use the search function to get the correct IDs. 

Once the location IDs are obtained, I can structure the legs array with each flight segment. The cabin class is economy, and the sort parameter should be "BEST" to get the best flights. The user didn't mention the number of adults or children, so I'll default to 1 adult unless specified otherwise. 

After getting the flight search results, I'll need to retrieve detailed flight information using Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search results. Similarly, the seat maps can be obtained using Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken. 

Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops returns a token and offerToken? The parameters for Get_Flight_Details require a token, and Get_Seat_Map requires an offerToken. So after the initial search, I need to extract those tokens from each flight result to fetch the details and seat maps. 

But the user's query is about the entire journey, so maybe each leg's details and seat maps need to be retrieved individually. This might require multiple function calls for each segment. 

So the steps are: 

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin.
2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array constructed from those IDs.
3. From the search results, get the token and offerToken for each flight segment.
4. Call Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map for each segment using the respective tokens.
5. Compile all the information into a summary for the user.

But since the tools are limited to the functions provided, I need to make sure each function call is correctly structured. Also, the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so the Search_Flight_Location is necessary to get accurate IDs. 

Wait, the user mentioned leaving from London on December 1st, so the first leg is London to Paris. Then a week later, Paris to Berlin on December 8th, and then Berlin back to London on December 15th. So three legs in total. 

The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires the legs array with each leg's fromId, toId, and date. So first, I need to get the location IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city:

- Query "London" to get its airport ID (e.g., LON).
- Query "Paris" to get its airport ID (e.g., PAR).
- Query "Berlin" to get its airport ID (e.g., BER).

Once those IDs are obtained, structure the legs array as:

[
  { "fromId": "LON.AIRPORT", "toId": "PAR.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-01" },
  { "fromId": "PAR.AIRPORT", "toId": "BER.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-08" },
  { "fromId": "BER.AIRPORT", "toId": "LON.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-12-15" }
]

Then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with this legs array, cabinClass as ECONOMY, and sort as BEST. 

Once the flight search results are obtained, for each flight in the results, extract the token and offerToken. Then call Get_Flight_Details with the token and Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken for each leg. 

But the user might need the detailed information for each flight segment. So multiple tool calls would be necessary. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. But since the user is asking for the entire journey, the assistant should first get the flight search results, then proceed to get details and seat maps. 

Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs. But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so the assistant needs to first perform those searches. However, the initial query doesn't include the airport codes, so the assistant must first handle that. 

Wait, but the user might not have provided the exact locations, so the assistant should first use Search_Flight_Location to get the correct IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin. Then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. 

So the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for London. Then Paris, then Berlin. But since each tool call is separate, the assistant might need to do this step-by-step. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to plan the sequence of tool calls. However, in the context of this exercise, the assistant is supposed to make the necessary tool calls in the order required. 

But given that the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, the first step would be to search for the location IDs. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle this internally. Alternatively, the assistant might assume that the user has provided the correct airport codes, but since they didn't, the assistant needs to first get the location IDs. 

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed directly to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops if the IDs are known. But since the user hasn't provided them, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location. 

Therefore, the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location with query "London" to get its ID. Then, subsequent calls for Paris and Berlin. However, in the current setup, each tool call is separate, so the assistant would need to handle this step-by-step. 

But since the user is asking for a multi-stop trip, the assistant needs all three legs. Therefore, the assistant must first get the location IDs for all three cities before proceeding to search for flights. 

So the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location for London, then for Paris, then for Berlin. Once the IDs are obtained, the assistant can then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. 

But since the assistant can only make one tool call per response, the first step is to start with Search_Flight_Location for London. Then, in subsequent interactions, proceed with the other steps. However, in this scenario, the user is expecting a single response with all necessary tool calls. 

Wait, the instructions say that for each function call, return a JSON object within tool_call tags. The user's query might require multiple function calls, but the assistant should make them in sequence as needed. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. 

But in this case, the user's query requires multiple steps: first, getting location IDs, then searching flights, then getting details and seat maps. However, the assistant is supposed to determine which tool to call first. 

Given that, the first necessary step is to get the location IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin. Therefore, the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for London. Then, subsequent calls for Paris and Berlin. 

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first response would be to call Search_Flight_Location for London. Then, once that's done, proceed to call it for Paris, and so on. 

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. But according to the instructions, for each function call, return a JSON object within tool_call tags. So each tool_call is a single function call. 

Therefore, the assistant should start by calling Search_Flight_Location for London. 

Wait, but the user's main goal is to find flights for the entire journey. So perhaps the assistant should first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, but without the location IDs, that's not possible. Therefore, the first step is indeed to get the location IDs. 

So the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location with query "London" to get its ID. Then, similarly for Paris and Berlin. 

But since the assistant can only make one tool call per response, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for London. Then, in the next step, the user (or system) would provide the response, and the assistant would proceed to call it for Paris, then Berlin. 

Once all location IDs are obtained, the assistant can then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location with query "London".
