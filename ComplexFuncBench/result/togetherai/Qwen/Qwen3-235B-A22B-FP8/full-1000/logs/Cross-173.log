Okay, let's break down what the user needs. Aden is staying at Nantasket Beach Hotel and wants attraction recommendations nearby, along with detailed descriptions. 

First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function with the hotel_id provided. The response mentioned Boston Harbor Islands National Park as a nearby landmark. 

Next, I needed to get more details about that attraction. So, I used Search_Attraction_Location with the query "Boston Harbor Islands National Park" to find related products. The result was a Boston Harbor Sightseeing Cruise.

Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the previous step to retrieve all the specifics. The response included the description, cancellation policy, pricing, and other important info.

Now, I need to present this information in a clear and helpful way. The user probably wants to know what the attraction is, what's included, any requirements, and how much it costs. I'll structure the answer to highlight the key points like the cruise duration, sights seen, inclusions, pricing, and practical tips. Also, mention the free cancellation and any terms from the policies. Make sure it's easy to read and covers all the details Aden would need to decide if this fits their plans.
