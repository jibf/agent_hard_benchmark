Okay, let's break down the user's request. They need to find the cheapest multi-stop flight from Shenzhen to Miami with a layover in Dubai around December 10, 2024. Also, they don't want overnight layovers. Then, they need the seat map for that flight.

First, I need to get the location IDs for Shenzhen, Dubai, and Miami. The Search_Flight_Location function can help with that. Let me start by searching for Shenzhen's airport code. Using the query "Shenzhen" should give me the fromId for the first leg.

Next, search for Dubai's airport code since that's the layover. The same function with "Dubai" as the query should work. Then, do the same for Miami. Once I have all three IDs, I can proceed.

Now, to find the cheapest flights. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function requires the legs array with fromId, toId, and date. The user mentioned around December 10, so I'll use that date for the first leg. The second leg is Dubai to Miami on the same date? Wait, but the layover can't be overnight. So the departure from Dubai should be on the same day as arrival, so the second leg's date should be December 10 as well. But sometimes layovers might span into the next day. Wait, the user says no overnight layovers, so the layover must be on the same day. So both legs are on December 10. But I need to confirm if that's possible. Maybe the API handles the layover duration automatically, but the user's constraint is that the layover isn't overnight. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function might not account for layover duration, so maybe after getting the cheapest options, we need to check the flight details for layover times. But the user hasn't provided a function to check flight details, only to get the seat map. Hmm.

Wait, the user wants the cheapest multi-stop flight with layover in Dubai, no overnight. So first, get the minimum price, but the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function might not filter by layover duration. So maybe after getting the minimum price, we need to check the actual flight details to ensure the layover isn't overnight. But the user hasn't provided a function for that. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function can be used with the sort parameter set to CHEAPEST, which might include layover info. But the user's instruction says to first get the minimum price, then get the seat map. So perhaps proceed with Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops first, then use the offerToken from that to get the seat map. Wait, but Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the minimum price within 5 days before and after, but the user wants around December 10. So maybe the date is December 10, and the API checks 5 days before and after, but the user wants the flight on that date. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to find the cheapest flight on December 10 with a layover in Dubai, no overnight. So first, get the minimum price for that date, then get the seat map. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the lowest price within 5 days around the date. However, the user might need the exact date. Maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is better, sorted by CHEAPEST, then use the offerToken from the result to get the seat map. But the user's instruction says to first get the minimum price, then the seat map. Let me check the functions again.

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. The user says "around December 10", so maybe that's acceptable. But the user also needs the seat map, which requires an offerToken from a flight search. So perhaps first, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest price, but then need to perform a Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops includes the offerToken, but looking at its description, it's not mentioned. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops probably returns price data, not the flight details. Therefore, after finding the minimum price, we need to perform a Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs and sort by CHEAPEST to get the flight with the offerToken, then use that for the seat map.

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Shenzhen, Dubai, and Miami to get their IDs.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flights on December 10, with legs Shenzhen-Dubai and Dubai-Miami.
3. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs, sorted by CHEAPEST, to get the offerToken.
4. Finally, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user's query says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight" which might mean they want the actual flight details, including the dates (to confirm layover isn't overnight). So after getting the cheapest flight via Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, check the flight's layover time. However, the functions provided don't include a way to check layover duration, so maybe the user expects that the API returns flights that meet the no overnight layover condition. But the functions don't have a parameter to specify that. So the user might need to handle that manually, but since the assistant can't do that, perhaps proceed with the available functions.

Putting it all together:

First, get the location IDs. Then, search for the minimum price, then search for flights to get the offerToken for the seat map. But the user might need the actual flight details, so maybe skip Get_Min_Price and directly use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops sorted by CHEAPEST to get the cheapest flight, then get the seat map. The Get_Min_Price might just give the price, not the flight details needed for the seat map.

So the correct approach is:

1. Get the location IDs for Shenzhen, Dubai, Miami.
2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs Shenzhen-Dubai on Dec 10 and Dubai-Miami on Dec 10 (assuming no overnight layover), sorted by CHEAPEST.
3. From the result, get the offerToken.
4. Use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user mentioned "around December 10", so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is better to find the cheapest dates around that time. However, the user wants the seat map for the flight, which requires the offerToken from a flight search. So perhaps first use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the best date, then use that date in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight details. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the min price in the date range, but the exact date might be needed for the flight search.

Alternatively, proceed directly with Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for December 10, sort by CHEAPEST, get the offerToken, then seat map. But need to ensure that the layover in Dubai isn't overnight. However, the function parameters don't allow specifying layover duration, so the assistant can't filter that. Therefore, the user might have to check the flight details manually, but since the functions don't provide that info, the assistant can only proceed with the available tools.

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.
2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs (Shenzhen to Dubai on Dec 10, Dubai to Miami on Dec 10), sorted by CHEAPEST.
3. From the response, get the offerToken.
4. Use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But wait, the layover in Dubai must be on the same day. So the first leg departs Shenzhen on Dec 10, arrives Dubai same day, then the second leg departs Dubai same day to Miami. The flight search should return such options. The user's constraint of no overnight layovers is important, but the API parameters don't have a way to specify that, so the assistant can't enforce it via the function. Therefore, the assistant can only proceed with the given functions and assume that the user will check the flight times manually, or the API returns flights that meet the criteria.

So, the function calls needed are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Shenzhen.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Dubai.
3. Search_Flight_Location for Miami.
4. Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the three legs (wait, no: the legs are two, Shenzhen to Dubai and Dubai to Miami, same date).
5. Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the search results.

But the user's message says "get the seat map for the flight", implying that after finding the flight, we need to get its seat map. So the assistant needs to first get the flight data via Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, then extract the offerToken to call Get_Seat_Map.

Therefore, the correct sequence is:

- Get all necessary location IDs.
- Search for flights with the given legs and sorted by CHEAPEST.
- Then get the seat map using the offerToken from the search result.

So the tool calls would be:

First, three Search_Flight_Location calls for Shenzhen, Dubai, and Miami to get their IDs. Then, Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs and sort by CHEAPEST. Then Get_Seat_Map.
