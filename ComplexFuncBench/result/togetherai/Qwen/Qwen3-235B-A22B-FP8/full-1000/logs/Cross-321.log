I'll stay in each city for five days. Find the cheapest connecting flights for me. Additionally, I need to rent a car at each destination for convenience. I'll pick up the car at the airport one hour after my flight lands and return it two hours before my flight takes off.

Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they need flights from Los Angeles to New York, then to Columbia University, with a 5-day stay in each city. They want the cheapest connecting flights. Then, car rentals at each destination with specific pickup and drop-off times.

Starting with the flights. The user mentioned leaving Los Angeles on November 10th, 2024. They have two stops: New York University and Columbia University. Wait, but both universities are in New York City, right? So maybe the flights are from LA to NYC, then maybe another flight to another city? Wait, no, Columbia University is in NYC, same as NYU. So maybe the user is making two stops in NYC? But the user said "in sequence" and "stay in each city for five days." Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the user intended to go from LA to NYC, stay 5 days, then fly to another city where Columbia University is located? Wait, but Columbia is in NYC. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I should proceed as per their input.

Wait, perhaps the user is visiting both universities in the same city? That might not require a flight in between. So maybe the flights are just from LA to NYC, and then the return flight after 10 days total? But the user mentioned "connecting flights" which implies a multi-stop. Maybe the user intended to go from LA to NYC, stay 5 days, then fly to another destination where Columbia University is located, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to two different cities, but NYU and Columbia are both in NYC. So perhaps the user made an error, but I should proceed with the given information.

Assuming that the user wants to fly from LA to NYC on Nov 10, stay 5 days (leaving Nov 15), then fly to another destination (maybe Philadelphia for UPenn?), but the user specified Columbia University, which is in NYC. So perhaps the user has a mistake here, but I'll proceed with the given info. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to visit both universities in NYC, so only one flight to NYC, stay 10 days, but the user specified two stops. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to go to New York City (NYU) and then another city where Columbia University is located, but that's not the case. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I should proceed with the given input. So the flights would be from LAX to NYC (JFK, LGA, or EWR) on Nov 10, then another flight from NYC to another city where Columbia University is located, but since that's not the case, maybe the user intended a multi-city trip with two stops in NYC? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to return after 5 days, but the request says "in sequence" with each city stay. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended to go to New York University (NYC) first, stay 5 days, then fly to another university in a different city, but the name is Columbia University, which is in NYC. Maybe the user meant Columbia University in South Carolina? There is a Columbia University in SC. Let me check. Yes, there's a University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC. So maybe the user intended to go from LA to NYC (NYU), stay 5 days, then fly to Columbia, SC (University of South Carolina), stay 5 days, then return. That would make sense for a multi-stop flight. Alternatively, the user might have confused the location. 

Assuming that the user intended two different cities: first stop New York City (NYU), second stop Columbia, SC (University of South Carolina). Then the flights would be LAX to NYC on Nov 10, then NYC to Columbia, SC on Nov 15, then return from Columbia, SC to LAX on Nov 20. But the user didn't specify the return date, but the initial request is to find the cheapest connecting flights. Alternatively, the user might have a return flight after both stops. But the user's message says "leaving Los Angeles on November 10th, 2024, to give speeches at New York University and Columbia University in sequence. I'll stay in each city for five days." So departure from LA on Nov 10, stay in first city until Nov 15, then go to second city until Nov 20, then return. So the flights would be LA to NYC (Nov 10), NYC to Columbia (Nov 15), and then Columbia to LA (Nov 20). But the user didn't mention the return, but since they need to come back, the flights would be multi-stop: LA -> NYC -> Columbia -> LA. But the user might need a round trip. However, the user's request is to "find the cheapest connecting flights for me," which implies the outbound and return, possibly with stops. But the exact itinerary needs clarification. However, given the user's input, I'll proceed with the assumption that they need a multi-stop flight with two stops: LA to first destination (NYC), then to second destination (Columbia, SC), and then return. But the user didn't specify the return, so maybe it's a one-way? Unlikely. Alternatively, the user might need a round-trip ticket with multiple stops. 

But the function available is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, which allows multiple legs. So the legs would be:

1. LA to NYC (Nov 10)
2. NYC to Columbia (Nov 15)
3. Columbia to LA (Nov 20)

But the user didn't mention the return, but it's implied they need to come back. However, the user's message says "leaving Los Angeles" which might imply one-way, but that's unlikely. So perhaps the user needs a round-trip ticket with multiple stops. Alternatively, the user might have a return leg from the second destination to LA. 

But to proceed, I need to get the flight locations first. The user mentioned leaving LA on Nov 10, so the first leg is from LA to NYC. Then, after 5 days (Nov 15), fly from NYC to Columbia. Then after another 5 days (Nov 20), return to LA. But the return flight would be from Columbia to LA. However, the user might prefer to return from NYC instead. But without more info, I'll proceed with the three legs as per the user's stay.

First, I need to find the airport codes for LA, NYC, and Columbia, SC. 

For LA, the main airport is LAX. For NYC, options are JFK, LGA, EWR. For Columbia, SC, the airport is CAE. 

So the legs would be:

1. From LAX to JFK on 2024-11-10
2. From JFK to CAE on 2024-11-15
3. From CAE to LAX on 2024-11-20

But the user might not have specified the return, but since they mentioned staying in each city for five days, the total trip is 10 days, so the return would be on Nov 20. 

Now, using the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function, I need to structure the legs array with each leg's fromId, toId, and date. But first, I need to get the airport IDs for these cities using Search_Flight_Location. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided the airport codes, so I need to first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the airport IDs. 

First, for Los Angeles: call Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get LAX's ID. Then for New York City: query "New York" to get JFK, LGA, EWR. Then for Columbia, SC: query "Columbia, South Carolina" to get CAE. 

But since the user is flying from LA to NYC first, then NYC to Columbia, then Columbia back to LA. 

But the function requires the legs array. However, the user wants the cheapest flights, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST". Cabin class is not specified, so default to ECONOMY. Adults is 1 unless specified. 

So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. But since the user hasn't provided the airport codes, the assistant should first perform these searches to get the correct IDs. 

But in the tool calls, the assistant can only call functions based on the given tools. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each location. However, the user's initial query requires multiple steps: first get the airport IDs, then search for flights with those IDs, then handle car rentals. 

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. However, in this case, the user's message requires multiple steps, but the assistant needs to generate the first tool call. 

Wait, the user's message requires the assistant to first find the flight legs, which requires knowing the airport IDs. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. However, the assistant can't make multiple tool calls in one response. So the first tool call would be to search for the departure location (Los Angeles), then the next steps would involve subsequent tool calls. But since the assistant can only return one tool call per turn, perhaps the first step is to get the departure airport ID. 

But given the complexity, perhaps the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles, then New York,
