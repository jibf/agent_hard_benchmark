Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they need to take a taxi from 145 Richmond Rd to the University of Ottawa at 7 AM on December 10th, 2024, and then another taxi at 3 PM to a shopping mall in a nearby city. 

The first thing I need to do is find the Google Place IDs for both the pickup and drop-off locations for each trip. The user mentioned "University of Ottawa" and "shopping mall in a nearby city." But the functions available require using the Taxi_Search_Location to get the googlePlaceId. So, I should start by searching for the place IDs for 145 Richmond Rd and University of Ottawa for the first trip.

Wait, the user is starting at 145 Richmond Rd, which is the pickup location for the first taxi. The drop-off is the University of Ottawa. Then, the second trip starts at the University of Ottawa (as the new pickup) and goes to a shopping mall in a nearby city. But the nearby city needs to be determined. However, the Get_Nearby_Cities function can be used to find nearby cities around the University of Ottawa's coordinates. But to use Get_Nearby_Cities, I need the latitude and longitude of the University of Ottawa. 

So, first, I need to get the coordinates of the University of Ottawa. But how? The user hasn't provided that yet. Wait, the Meta collection has a function called locationToLatLong, but that's not listed in the tools provided. Wait, looking back at the tools, the Get_Nearby_Cities function's parameters mention that longitude and latitude can be retrieved from the Meta collection's locationToLatLong endpoint. But the tools listed here don't include that function. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to use another method. Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location can provide coordinates. Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location's description says it's to find the googlePlaceId for taxi locations. So perhaps when we search for the University of Ottawa using Taxi_Search_Location, it might return the coordinates or the googlePlaceId. 

Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location function's parameters take a query string (like location names) and returns the googlePlaceId. So, for each pickup and drop-off, we need to call Taxi_Search_Location to get the googlePlaceId. 

So for the first taxi trip: pickup is 145 Richmond Rd. I need to call Taxi_Search_Location with query "145 Richmond Rd" to get its googlePlaceId. Similarly, for the drop-off at University of Ottawa, call Taxi_Search_Location with query "University of Ottawa" to get its googlePlaceId. Then, use those place IDs along with the pickup time and date to call Search_Taxi for the first trip.

For the second trip, the pickup is the University of Ottawa (already got its googlePlaceId from the first step). The drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. To find nearby cities, we need to get the coordinates of the University of Ottawa. Wait, but how? The Get_Nearby_Cities function requires latitude and longitude. Since the Taxi_Search_Location might not provide coordinates, maybe the user expects us to use another method. But in the tools provided, there's no direct way to get coordinates from a place ID. Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location returns coordinates? Wait, looking at the Taxi_Search_Location function's description: it says it's to find the googlePlaceId. The parameters are just a query. The output isn't specified here, but the user would need to get the googlePlaceId from that function's response. 

Wait, perhaps the Taxi_Search_Location function returns the googlePlaceId and maybe coordinates. But since the function's parameters only require a query, and the output isn't detailed here, maybe the user expects that after getting the googlePlaceId, we can proceed. However, for Get_Nearby_Cities, we need the latitude and longitude. Since the user hasn't provided those, maybe we need to first get the coordinates of the University of Ottawa. But how? The Meta collection's locationToLatLong endpoint is mentioned in the parameters for Get_Nearby_Cities, but that function isn't listed in the tools. So perhaps that's a missing step, but since the tools don't include that function, maybe we can't use it. 

Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Ottawa" returns a place with coordinates. If the user's system allows that, then after getting the googlePlaceId for the University, we can get its coordinates from that data. But the function's description here doesn't specify that. So perhaps the user expects that we can get the coordinates from the Taxi_Search_Location response. However, given the function definitions provided, the Taxi_Search_Location's output isn't specified here. 

This is a bit of a problem. The user wants to find nearby cities around the University of Ottawa, which requires coordinates. But without a function to get coordinates from a place ID or name, we can't proceed. Wait, looking back at the tools, there's a Get_Nearby_Cities function that takes longitude and latitude, which can be retrieved from Meta's locationToLatLong. But since that function isn't in the tools, maybe the user expects that we can somehow get the coordinates through another means. 

Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location returns coordinates. Let's assume that when we call Taxi_Search_Location with "University of Ottawa", it returns a place with coordinates. If that's the case, then we can use those coordinates in Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities. But since the function definitions here don't specify that, it's a bit of a stretch. However, given the user's problem, we need to proceed with the available functions.

So, step by step:

1. For the first taxi trip:
   a. Use Taxi_Search_Location for pickup "145 Richmond Rd" to get pick_up_place_id.
   b. Use Taxi_Search_Location for drop-off "University of Ottawa" to get drop_off_place_id.
   c. Then call Search_Taxi with those place IDs, pickup time (7:00 AM + 20 minutes? Wait, the user says "in 20 minutes" to arrive, so pickup time is 7:00 AM, but the trip takes 20 minutes. Wait, the user says "I want to take a taxi from 145 Richmond Rd to University of Ottawa in 20 minutes to see my friend. We'll have lunch at the school first." So the pickup time should be arranged so that the taxi arrives at 7:00 AM + 20 minutes? Or the pickup time is 7:00 AM, and the trip takes 20 minutes, arriving at 7:20 AM. The user probably wants to leave at 7:00 AM to arrive in 20 minutes, so pickup time is 7:00 AM. The pick_up_time parameter is "7:00", pick_up_date is "2024-12-10".

2. For the second taxi trip at 3 PM:
   a. The pickup is University of Ottawa (already have its googlePlaceId from step 1b).
   b. The drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. Need to find nearby cities to the University of Ottawa. To use Get_Nearby_Cities, need coordinates. But how? Since the user hasn't provided coordinates, perhaps the Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Ottawa" returns coordinates. Let's assume that when we call Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Ottawa", we get latitude and longitude. Then use those in Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities. Once we have nearby cities, perhaps we can then use Taxi_Search_Location again to find a shopping mall in one of those cities, but the user hasn't specified which city. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants a taxi to a nearby city's shopping mall, so the drop-off location could be a mall in a nearby city. But without knowing which city, perhaps the function can handle it once we have the nearby cities.

Wait, but the user's instruction is to "arrange the taxis for both trips". So for the second trip, the drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. The user hasn't specified which mall or city, so perhaps the assistant needs to first find nearby cities, then find a mall in one of them, then arrange the taxi. However, the available functions don't include a way to search for malls, except maybe Taxi_Search_Location. But the user might expect that the assistant can proceed as follows:

For the second trip:
a. Use Get_Nearby_Cities with the coordinates of the University of Ottawa to get nearby cities.
b. Choose one of the nearby cities (e.g., the closest one) and search for a shopping mall there using Taxi_Search_Location.
c. Then call Search_Taxi with the pickup as University of Ottawa and drop-off as the mall's place ID.

But since the assistant can only call the functions provided, and the user hasn't specified which city or mall, perhaps the assistant can't proceed beyond getting the nearby cities. However, the user's request is to arrange the taxis, so the assistant must find a way to get the necessary place IDs.

But given the functions available, the assistant might need to:

1. For the first trip:
   - Call Taxi_Search_Location for both 145 Richmond Rd and University of Ottawa to get their googlePlaceIds.
   - Then call Search_Taxi for the first trip with those IDs, pickup time 7:00 AM on 2024-12-10.

2. For the second trip:
   - Need to get the coordinates of the University
