2025-08-13 22:03:30,560 - evaluation_logger_Flights-40 - INFO - Query: I'm looking for the cheapest economy class air ticket. Right now, I'm planning to set off from Chicago on November 10th, 2024, travel through Frankfurt on November 11th and then fly to Vienna. Finally, I'll return to Chicago on November 24th, 2024. Check the details of the flights. I want to know things like the baggage limit. Thanks for your help.

Okay, let's see. The user wants the cheapest economy class flights for a multi-stop trip. They're leaving Chicago on Nov 10, then Frankfurt on Nov 11, Vienna, and back to Chicago on Nov 24. They also want flight details like baggage limits.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned a multi-stop flight, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is necessary. They need to search for flights with three legs: Chicago to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Vienna, and then Vienna back to Chicago. 

Wait, the dates: Nov 10 departure from Chicago, next day (Nov 11) in Frankfurt, then to Vienna, and return on Nov 24. So the legs would be:
1. From Chicago (ORD?) to Frankfurt (FRA?), date Nov 10.
2. From Frankfurt to Vienna (VIE?), date Nov 11.
3. Return from Vienna to Chicago, date Nov 24.

But the user didn't specify the exact airports, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location function first to get the airport codes for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna. But maybe the user expects me to assume the main airports, like ORD for Chicago, FRA for Frankfurt, and VIE for Vienna. However, the correct approach is to search for each city's airport using the Search_Flight_Location function with the query parameters.

Wait, but the user might not have provided the exact airport names, so the assistant should first get the correct airport IDs for each city. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Chicago, Frankfurt, Vienna to get their airport codes. But since the user mentioned "Chicago", "Frankfurt", and "Vienna", the assistant can use those to get the airport IDs.

But the problem is that the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function requires the legs with fromId and toId, which are obtained from the Search_Flight_Location function. So the assistant should first get the airport IDs for each city.

Wait, but the user's query is asking to check the flights and details like baggage. So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs.
2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs using those IDs to find the cheapest economy flights.
3. Then, for each flight, use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search results to get baggage info, etc.

But the user hasn't provided any tokens yet, so the first step is to perform the search flights multi stops to get the token. Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's response would include a token, which is then used in Get_Flight_Details. So the assistant needs to first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the correct legs, then use the token from that response to get the details.

But the user hasn't done any search yet. So the first step is to perform the search for multi-stop flights with the given dates and cities, then use the token from that search to get the flight details.

But to construct the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops request, the assistant needs the fromId and toId for each leg. Therefore, first, the assistant needs to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna using the Search_Flight_Location function.

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact airport names, so the assistant should first search for each city's airport. For example, Chicago has ORD and MDW, Frankfurt is FRA, Vienna is VIE.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get the airport ID for Chicago O'Hare (ORD), then Frankfurt's airport (FRA), then Vienna (VIE). Then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops legs.

But the user's message requires the assistant to generate the function calls. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the airport IDs. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function.

But the user's query is to check the flights and details like baggage. So the process is:

1. Get airport IDs for each city via Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with parameters: economy class, cheapest sort.
3. Then use the token from the search results in Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info.

But the assistant can't perform multiple steps in one response. The user's initial query requires the assistant to generate the necessary function calls in order.

So the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Vienna. However, each function call is separate. But the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. Wait, but the user's instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the same response.

Wait, looking at the example in the tools description: the assistant should return each tool call in separate XML tags. So the assistant can call multiple functions in one response.

But in practice, the assistant should first get the airport IDs. So first, three calls to Search_Flight_Location for each city. But maybe the user's query can be handled by first getting the airport IDs, then the flight search, then the details.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to generate the necessary function calls in order. However, the assistant can't chain the calls in one response. The assistant must make each call in sequence, but the user's system would handle the flow.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the same response. However, in this case, the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs, then use them in the flight search. So the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city, then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

But how to represent that in the tool calls. Since each tool call is a separate function, the assistant can first call Search_Flight_Location for Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Vienna, then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. But the assistant can't execute them in sequence in one response. So perhaps the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city, then proceed.

But the user's system would need to handle the output of those calls and then make the next calls. However, the assistant's response should include all necessary tool calls in the correct order.

Alternatively, the assistant might assume that the airport codes are known (like ORD for Chicago, FRA for Frankfurt, VIE for Vienna) and proceed directly to the multi-stop search. But the correct approach is to use the Search_Flight_Location function to get the accurate IDs.

So the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the airport IDs.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get the airport ID for Chicago. Then similarly for Frankfurt and Vienna.

But the user's query mentions "Chicago" as the departure city. So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get the airport ID. Then same for Frankfurt and Vienna.

Therefore, the first three tool calls would be to Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But the assistant can only make one tool call per response? Or can they make multiple in one response? The example shows that multiple tool calls can be made.

Looking at the tools example:

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags.

So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response.

Therefore, the assistant can first call Search_Flight_Location for Chicago, then for Frankfurt, then for Vienna. Then, using the IDs obtained from these calls, proceed to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs.

But since the assistant can't know the results of the first calls in the same response, perhaps the correct approach is to first make the Search_Flight_Location calls, then the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, but in separate steps. However, the user's system would handle this step-by-step.

But according to the problem statement, the assistant must generate the tool calls in the response. So the assistant should generate the necessary function calls in the order they need to be executed.

So the first step is to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna. Therefore, three calls to Search_Flight_Location with the respective queries.

Then, using the obtained IDs, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs and parameters (economy, cheapest). Then, get the token from that response and call Get_Flight_Details.

But since the user's query is to check the flights and details like baggage, the assistant needs to perform all these steps.

However, the assistant can only return the first necessary tool call(s) in the response. Since the user hasn't done any searches yet, the first step is to get the airport IDs.

So the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, but the user's query includes three cities: Chicago (from), Frankfurt (stop), Vienna (destination), and return. So the legs are:

Leg 1: Chicago to Frankfurt on Nov 10.

Leg 2: Frankfurt to Vienna on Nov 11.

Leg 3: Vienna to Chicago on Nov 24.

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's legs parameter is an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date. So the assistant needs to get the IDs for each city.

Therefore, the first three tool calls are to Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But how to structure this. Let's proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Flight_Location
