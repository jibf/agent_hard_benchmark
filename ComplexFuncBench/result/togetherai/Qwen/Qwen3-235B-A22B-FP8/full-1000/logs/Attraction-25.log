2025-08-13 21:24:24,715 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about Westminster Abbey after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Westminster Abbey" as the query. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details function. 

The data from Get_Attraction_Details includes a description, cancellation policy, what's included, and other details. The user probably wants a concise summary highlighting key points like history, what the tour includes, pricing, and practical info like cancellation and accessibility.

I should structure the answer to be engaging, mention the historical significance, the tour specifics, costs, and any important notes like accessibility and cancellation. Also, since the user found it on social media, emphasizing the unique aspects like the private tour and expert guide might be appealing. Need to make sure all the important details are covered without overwhelming them with too much data.
