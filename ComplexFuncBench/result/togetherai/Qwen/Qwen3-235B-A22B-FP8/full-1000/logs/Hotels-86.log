Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants to find three hotels near Pike Place Market in Seattle that have airport shuttles. They also need detailed information and payment methods for these hotels. The conference dates are December 10th to 20th, 2024.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned Pike Place Market, which is a specific location. So, the first step is to search for the destination using the "Search_Hotel_Destination" function. The query parameter would be "Pike Place Market, Seattle". This should give me the dest_id needed for searching hotels.

Once I have the dest_id, I can use the "Search_Hotels" function. The parameters required are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, and departure_date. The arrival date is December 10th, departure is December 20th. The search_type might be "city" or something similar, but I need to get that from the searchDestination response. Also, I should check if there are any filters for airport shuttles. Wait, the "categories_filter" parameter in Search_Hotels can be used for that. But first, I need to get the filter options using "Get_Filter" function. However, the user specifically mentioned airport shuttles, which might be a specific filter. 

Wait, the "categories_filter" can be retrieved from the Get_Filter endpoint. But how does that work? The Get_Filter function requires parameters like search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, etc. Maybe after getting the dest_id from searchDestination, I can call Get_Filter with the necessary parameters to find the filter for airport shuttles. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function can take a filter parameter directly. The user might need to apply a filter for "airport shuttle" service. 

But looking at the functions, the Get_Filter function's description says it's to get the categories_filter parameter for Search_Hotels. So perhaps I need to first call Get_Filter to find the correct filter value for airport shuttles, then use that in the Search_Hotels function. However, the Get_Filter parameters include search_type, dest_id, etc., which I don't have yet. So the order would be:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination to get dest_id for Pike Place Market, Seattle.
2. Use Get_Filter with the dest_id and dates to find the categories_filter for airport shuttles.
3. Then use Search_Hotels with the dest_id, dates, and the filter to find hotels with airport shuttles.
4. Once the hotels are found, get their hotel_ids and call Get_Hotel_Details and Payment_features_of_the_Hotel for each to get detailed info and payment methods.

But wait, the user wants three hotels. So after searching, I need to pick three from the results. Also, the Search_Hotels function might return a list, so I can take the top three. Then, for each of those three, call Get_Hotel_Details and Payment_features_of_the_Hotel.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Pike Place Market, Seattle" to get dest_id.
2. Use the dest_id from step 1 to call Get_Filter, which will help find the categories_filter for airport shuttles. Wait, but how exactly? The Get_Filter function's parameters include search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date. So after getting dest_id, I can call Get_Filter with the dates and dest_id to get possible filters. But the user wants to filter hotels that have airport shuttles. The categories_filter might have a value like "airport_shuttle" or similar. However, the Get_Filter function's purpose is to get the possible categories_filter values. But the user might not know the exact filter name. So maybe the Get_Filter function would return available filters, and I need to find the one related to airport shuttles. But since the user can't interactively do this, perhaps the assistant should assume that the filter for airport shuttles is known (like "airport_shuttle") or find it through Get_Filter.

But given that the assistant can't make multiple interactive calls, maybe the Search_Hotels function can accept a filter parameter, and the user can input "airport shuttle" as part of categories_filter. However, the actual value for categories_filter might need to be a specific code. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function can take a filter parameter like "airport_shuttle" directly. The documentation says categories_filter can be retrieved from Get_Filter. So perhaps the assistant needs to first call Get_Filter to find the correct categories_filter value for airport shuttles, then use that in the Search_Hotels function.

But this is getting complicated. Let's proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Pike Place Market, Seattle" to get the dest_id. Then, using that dest_id, call Get_Filter with the necessary parameters (including the dates) to find the categories_filter that includes airport shuttles. Once the correct filter is known, call Search_Hotels with that filter, the dest_id, dates, etc. Then, from the search results, select three hotels, get their hotel_ids, and call Get_Hotel_Details and Payment_features_of_the_Hotel for each.

But the user's dates are December 10th to 20th, 2024. So arrival_date is 2024-12-10, departure_date is 2024-12-20. Adults and room_qty might default to 1 each, but the user is planning a conference, so maybe more people. However, the user hasn't specified the number of attendees, so perhaps the defaults are acceptable for the search. The children_age might be left out if there are no children.

So, step 1: Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Pike Place Market, Seattle" to get dest_id.

Then, step 2: Call Get_Filter with search_type (from searchDestination response?), dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date. But the Get_Filter parameters require search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date. The search_type might be obtained from the searchDestination response. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's response includes search_type? The description says "search_type can be retrieved from searchDestination endpoint". So after calling Search_Hotel_Destination, the response should include dest_id and search_type.

Assuming that, then after step 1, we have dest_id and search_type. Then, call Get_Filter with those parameters plus dates, adults, room_qty, etc. But the required parameters for Get_Filter are search_type, dest_id, departure_date, arrival_date. So we can proceed.

But the purpose of Get_Filter is to get the categories_filter options. However, the user wants to filter hotels with airport shuttles. So perhaps the Get_Filter will return possible categories, and the assistant needs to find the one that corresponds to airport shuttles. But since the assistant can't process the response here, maybe it's assumed that the categories_filter for airport shuttles is known, like "airport_shuttle".

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function's categories_filter can take a value like "airport_shuttle" directly. If that's the case, then the assistant can proceed to call Search_Hotels with categories_filter set to "airport_shuttle" without needing to call Get_Filter first. But according to the function's description, categories_filter should be retrieved from Get_Filter. So perhaps the assistant must first call Get_Filter to find the correct filter value.

This is a bit of a loop. To proceed, perhaps the assistant first calls Search_Hotel_Destination to get dest_id and search_type. Then, call Search_Hotels with the required parameters (search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date) and include categories_filter as "airport_shuttle" if that's a valid value. If not, maybe the assistant needs to use Get_Filter to find the correct value.

But given the constraints, maybe the assistant proceeds as follows:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Pike Place Market, Seattle".
2. From the response, get dest_id and search_type.
3. Call Search_Hotels with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date=2024-12-10, departure_date=2024-12-20, and categories_filter set to a value that represents airport shuttles. However, without knowing the exact value, perhaps the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant must call Get_Filter to find the correct categories_filter value for airport shuttles.

But how? The Get_Filter function's parameters include categories_filter, which seems odd. Wait, looking at the Get_Filter function's parameters:

{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "Get_Filter",
    "description": "Get the `categories_filter` parameter value for `Search_Hotels` function. EndPoint: /api/v1/hotels/getFilter",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "categories_filter": {"type": "string", "..."},
        "search_type": {"type": "string", "..."},
        "children_age": {"type": "..."},
        "dest_id": {"type": "..."},
        "room_qty": {"type": "..."},
        "departure_date": {"type": "..."},
        "arrival_date": {"type": "..."},
        "adults": {"type": "..."}
      },
      "required": ["search_type", "dest_id", "departure_date", "arrival_date"]
    }
  }
}

Wait, the Get_Filter function's parameters include categories_filter,
