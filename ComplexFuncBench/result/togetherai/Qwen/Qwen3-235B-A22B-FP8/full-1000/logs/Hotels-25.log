Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the reviews for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto from December 30, 2024, to January 3, 2025. They mentioned staying there to ring in the New Year.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user is asking for hotel reviews, so the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function seems necessary. But to use that, I need the hotel_id, which isn't provided directly. 

So, the first step is to search for the hotel's details to get its ID. The Search_Hotels function requires parameters like arrival_date, departure_date, dest_id, and search_type. But wait, the user hasn't provided the destination ID for Toronto. Therefore, I should first use the Search_Hotel_Destination function to find the destination ID for Toronto.

Let me start with the Search_Hotel_Destination function. The query parameter should be "Toronto". That should give me the dest_id. Once I have the dest_id, I can proceed to search for the hotel using Search_Hotels. 

For Search_Hotels, I need to input the arrival_date (2024-12-30), departure_date (2025-01-03), dest_id from the previous step, and the search_type which I think should be "CITY" based on the destination search. Also, maybe include the hotel name in the search_type? Wait, the search_type is retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. Wait, no, the search_type in Search_Hotels is a parameter that can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. Hmm, maybe the search_type should be "CITY" if the destination is a city. But I need to check the parameters for Search_Hotels. The required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. The search_type is obtained from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So after getting the destination ID for Toronto, the search_type might be "CITY" or another value. But since the user is looking for a specific hotel, maybe the search_type is "HOTEL" once we know the hotel's ID. Wait, no. The Search_Hotels function's search_type is from the Search Hotel Destination's response. Wait, looking back, the description says "search_type can be retrieved from api/v1/hotels/searchDestination endpoint in Hotels collection." So when we first search the destination, the response might include possible search_types. But perhaps for the initial step, the user is looking for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto, so maybe after getting the destination ID for Toronto, we can use search_type as "HOTEL" and specify the hotel name? Wait, no, the parameters for Search_Hotels don't have a hotel name field. The parameters are sort_by, search_type, categories_filter, price_min, price_max, children_age, adults, arrival_date, room_qty, dest_id, departure_date. So the search_type might be a value that indicates the type of search, like "CITY" or "HOTEL". But how do we specify the hotel name? Maybe the search_type is "HOTEL" and then the query in another parameter? Wait, no, the Search_Hotels function doesn't have a query parameter. Hmm, maybe the initial Search_Hotel_Destination is used to find the hotel's ID directly. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination function's description says "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." But the user wants a specific hotel, the Four Seasons in Toronto. So perhaps the Search_Hotel_Destination can be used with the query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get its ID. Wait, but the example for Search_Hotel_Destination seems to be for locations. Maybe the Search_Hotels function is the one that can find the hotel by name through the categories_filter or another parameter? Let me check the parameters again.

Looking at Search_Hotels parameters: categories_filter is retrieved from getFilter, which might not be helpful here. The parameters don't include a name search. So perhaps the process is:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get the dest_id, which might actually return the hotel's ID if it's specific enough. Or maybe first search for Toronto to get the city's dest_id, then use that to search for hotels in that city with the name.

But the Search_Hotels function's parameters don't have a name filter. This is confusing. Maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination can be used to find the specific hotel's ID. Let me check the function descriptions again.

Search_Hotel_Destination: "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc." So maybe if the query is specific enough, like "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto", it would return that hotel's details, including its ID. Then, using that ID, we can get reviews. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels function is used to find hotels in a location, but without knowing the hotel ID, we can't get reviews. 

So the steps would be:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get its hotel_id. If that works, then proceed to get reviews. If not, maybe first get the destination ID for Toronto, then use Search_Hotels with the dest_id and maybe other filters to find the hotel.

But according to the function definitions, the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function requires hotel_id. So the key is to get that hotel_id. 

Let me try the first approach: use Search_Hotel_Destination with the hotel name and location. If that returns the hotel's ID, then great. Otherwise, proceed with another step.

So first tool call: Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto".

Assuming that returns a dest_id and maybe a hotel ID, but looking at the function's description, it says the response contains latitude and longitude. Maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination doesn't return hotel IDs, just location info. Then, after getting the location (Toronto's dest_id), use Search_Hotels to find hotels in that location, but how to filter to Four Seasons? Since the parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a name filter, maybe the user would have to look through the results. But since the user specifically mentioned Four Seasons Hotel Toronto, perhaps the Search_Hotels function, when called with the dest_id for Toronto and the dates, would return that hotel in the results, and we can extract the hotel_id from there.

But the assistant can't manually look through results; it has to programmatically get the hotel_id. Therefore, this might be a limitation. However, given the available functions, perhaps the intended flow is:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the dest_id for Toronto (since the user is staying there).
2. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date to get a list of hotels, and somehow identify the Four Seasons Hotel in the response to get its hotel_id.
3. Then use Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- with the hotel_id to retrieve reviews.

But since the assistant can't process the response (as it's an API call), the user might need to provide the hotel_id. However, in this scenario, the user hasn't provided it, so the assistant must find a way to get it.

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination can be used with the hotel's name to get its ID. Let's proceed with that first.

So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto". If that returns a dest_id that can be used as hotel_id, then proceed. Otherwise, proceed to Search_Hotels.

But according to the function's description, Search_Hotel_Destination returns location info, not hotel-specific IDs. Therefore, the correct approach is:

1. Search for the destination (Toronto) to get dest_id.
2. Use Search_Hotels with dest_id, dates, etc., to get hotels in that area. But how to filter to Four Seasons? Since the parameters don't include a name, maybe the categories_filter or another parameter. Looking at the parameters for Search_Hotels, categories_filter is from getFilter, which might include categories like star ratings, but not names. Therefore, this approach might not work.

This suggests that the available functions might not allow retrieving reviews for a specific hotel unless the hotel_id is known. However, the user is asking for it, so there must be a way. Perhaps the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function can take a hotel name instead of hotel_id, but according to the parameters, hotel_id is required and must come from Search_Hotels or Search_HotelsByCoordinates.

Given that, perhaps the user's query lacks sufficient information (hotel_id) to proceed, but the assistant should attempt to find the hotel_id via the available functions.

Alternative approach: The assistant first uses Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Toronto" to get the dest_id. Then uses Search_Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, and maybe other parameters to get the list of hotels. But without a way to filter by name, the assistant can't programmatically get the hotel_id for Four Seasons. Therefore, this might be a dead end. However, perhaps in the Search_Hotels response, the hotel's name is included, and the assistant can infer it. But since the assistant can't process the response (as it's making the API call), the user would need to provide the hotel_id. But in this case, the user hasn't, so the assistant must make the calls to get to the point where the hotel_id is
