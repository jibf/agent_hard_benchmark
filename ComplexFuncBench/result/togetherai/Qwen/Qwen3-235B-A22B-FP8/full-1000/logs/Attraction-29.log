2025-08-13 21:25:07,591 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-29 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about Times Square after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Times Square" as the query. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details function. 

The data from Get_Attraction_Details shows that the main attraction here is a Times Square Photoshoot. The description mentions it's a professional photoshoot service with a local photographer, which aligns with the user's interest in getting more details about the place they saw online.

I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants to know what the attraction offers, how much it costs, and any important details like cancellation policies or what's included. The price is $107.49 USD, and there's a free cancellation policy. The photoshoot includes high-quality photos, a local guide, and a private gallery. 

Also, there are accessibility features mentioned, like wheelchair access and public transport options, which might be useful for planning. The user might not have considered booking a photoshoot, so highlighting the benefits like professional photos and local expertise could be helpful. 

I should structure the response to cover the main points: what the attraction is, cost, what's included, cancellation policy, and accessibility. Maybe end with a question to see if they want to proceed with booking or need more info.
