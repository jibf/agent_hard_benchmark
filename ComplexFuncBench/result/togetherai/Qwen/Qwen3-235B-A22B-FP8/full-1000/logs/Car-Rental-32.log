Okay, let's see. The user wants to rent a car in Melbourne and return it in Brisbane 48 hours later. They need detailed vehicle info.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned car rental, so the Search_Car_Rentals function is probably needed first. Then, after getting the vehicle ID and search key from that, use Vehicle_Details to get the details.

Wait, the parameters for Search_Car_Rentals require pick-up and drop-off details. The user provided Melbourne's coordinates for pick-up, and Brisbane's for drop-off. The pick-up date is November 25, 2024, at 8 am. Drop-off is 48 hours later, which would be November 27 at 8 am. Need to format dates as YYYY-MM-DD and times as HH:MM in 24-hour format.

So pick_up_date: 2024-11-25, pick_up_time: 08:00. Drop_off_date: 2024-11-27, drop_off_time: 08:00. The coordinates for Melbourne (pick-up) are longitude 144.96526, latitude -37.81298. Drop-off in Brisbane: longitude 153.02809, latitude -27.46794. 

I need to input all these into the Search_Car_Rentals function. Once that's done, the response should give vehicle_id and search_key, which are then used in Vehicle_Details. But the user wants detailed info, so after getting the search results, the next step would be to call Vehicle_Details with those parameters. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided a hotel ID, so the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By function isn't needed here. So the plan is: first call Search_Car_Rentals with all the given parameters, then use the vehicle_id and search_key from the response to call Vehicle_Details. 

I need to make sure all required parameters are included. The Search_Car_Rentals requires pick_up_longitude, drop_off_time, drop_off_latitude, drop_off_date, pick_up_time, pick_up_latitude, pick_up_date, drop_off_longitude. Let me check each:

- pick_up_longitude: 144.96526
- pick_up_latitude: -37.81298
- pick_up_date: 2024-11-25
- pick_up_time: 08:00
- drop_off_longitude: 153.02809
- drop_off_latitude: -27.46794
- drop_off_date: 2024-11-27
- drop_off_time: 08:00

Yes, all required parameters are there. So the first tool call is to Search_Car_Rentals with these. Then, the response should have vehicle_id and search_key, which are then used in Vehicle_Details. The user wants detailed info, so that's the next step. But since the user hasn't specified a particular vehicle, maybe the search results will return a list, and the user might need to select one. But the question says "give us detailed information about the vehicle," so perhaps the first step is to search, then get details for one of the vehicles in the results. However, since the user hasn't specified which one, maybe the assistant should first perform the search and then proceed to get details using the vehicle_id and search_key from the search results. 

But in the current setup, the user hasn't provided a specific vehicle ID, so the assistant needs to first perform the search, then use the results to call Vehicle_Details. However, the user's query is asking for detailed info, so the assistant should first perform the search, then use the returned vehicle_id and search_key to get the details. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Car_Rentals with the given parameters. Then, once that's done, the next step would be to call Vehicle_Details with the vehicle_id and search_key from the search results. However, since the user hasn't provided a specific vehicle, the assistant might need to present the search results and then proceed. But in the context of the tool calls, the assistant should first make the search call, then based on the results, make the vehicle details call. 

So the initial step is to call Search_Car_Rentals with the provided parameters. The assistant's first tool call should be that. Then, in a real scenario, the system would process that, get the vehicle IDs, and then the assistant would call Vehicle_Details. But since the user is asking for detailed info, the assistant needs to chain these two calls. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. Wait, the user's instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in sequence. 

But in the given example, the assistant should output the first tool call, then once that's processed, proceed to the next. However, in this static scenario, the assistant should output the necessary tool calls in order. However, the user's question requires first searching for cars, then getting details. So the assistant should first output the Search_Car_Rentals tool call, then after that, output the Vehicle_Details. But since the assistant can't know the vehicle_id and search_key until the first call is made, in a real scenario, the assistant would first make the search, then use the results to call Vehicle_Details. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Car_Rentals with the given parameters. Then, once that's done, the next step would be to call Vehicle_Details with the vehicle_id and search_key from the search results. However, since this is a single interaction, the assistant should first generate the Search_Car_Rentals call, and then, after that's processed, generate the Vehicle_Details call. But in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to generate all necessary tool calls in response to the user's query. However, the user's query requires a sequence of calls. 

Wait, looking back at the tools provided, the Vehicle_Details function requires vehicle_id and search_key, which are obtained from the Search_Car_Rentals function. Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Car_Rentals, get the results, and then call Vehicle_Details. But since the assistant can't execute the second call until the first has been processed, in this context, the assistant should first output the Search_Car_Rentals tool call. The user (or system) would then process that, get the necessary IDs, and then the assistant would proceed to call Vehicle_Details. However, in the current single interaction, the assistant can only make the first call. But the user's question asks for detailed information about the vehicle, which implies that after searching, the assistant should proceed to get details. 

But given the constraints, the assistant can only make the first tool call now. The user might need to provide the output of the first call to proceed. However, the user's instruction says "Give us detailed information about the vehicle." So the assistant needs to perform both steps. But how? Because the assistant can't make two tool calls in one response. Wait, looking at the example in the tools description, the assistant is supposed to return one or more tool calls in the response. Wait, the user instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So perhaps the assistant can chain the calls in sequence within the same response. But that's not possible because the second call depends on the result of the first. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to first call Search_Car_Rentals with the given parameters. Once that's done, the response will include the necessary vehicle_id and search_key to then call Vehicle_Details. However, since the assistant can't execute the second call immediately (as it needs the output from the first), the assistant should only make the first call now. The user (or system) would then process the first call, get the vehicle details, and then the assistant can proceed to call Vehicle_Details in a subsequent interaction. 

But the user's question is a single query, so perhaps the assistant should generate both tool calls in sequence. However, the second tool call depends on the output of the first, which isn't available yet. Therefore, the assistant can only generate the first tool call. The detailed vehicle information would require the user to provide the results of the search, but since the user hasn't done that, the assistant can't proceed further. 

Therefore, the correct initial step is to call Search_Car_Rentals with the provided parameters. The assistant's response should be the first tool call. The user would then need to provide the search results to proceed further. However, the user's query is asking for detailed info, so maybe the assistant should proceed to the next step. But without the vehicle_id and search_key, it's impossible. 

So the answer is to first call Search_Car_Rentals with all the given parameters. That's the only possible step here. The detailed information can't be retrieved yet because the vehicle isn't selected. The search will return available cars, and then the user can choose one, and the assistant can use Vehicle_Details with the specific vehicle_id and search_key.
