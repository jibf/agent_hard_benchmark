2025-08-13 22:06:18,130 - evaluation_logger_Flights-48 - INFO - Query: I'm looking for the cheapest economy class air ticket. Right now, I'm planning to set off from Los Angeles on September 18th, 2024, travel through Paris on September 19th and then fly to Rome. Finally, I'll return to Los Angeles on October 2nd, 2024. Check the details of the flights. I want to know things like the baggage limit. Thanks for your help.

Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want the cheapest economy class flights for a multi-stop trip. The itinerary is Los Angeles to Paris on Sept 18, then Paris to Rome on Sept 19, and back to LA on Oct 2. They also want flight details like baggage limits.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned searching for flights with multiple stops, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function is necessary. Then, they want details on those flights, so Get_Flight_Details will be needed after getting the flight tokens.

But wait, to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, I need the location IDs for Los Angeles, Paris, and Rome. The user didn't provide these, so I should first use Search_Flight_Location to get the airport IDs. Let me check the functions again. Yes, Search_Flight_Location takes a query parameter for locations. So I'll need to call that three times, once for each city, to get their respective IDs.

Wait, but maybe each city has multiple airports. For example, Los Angeles has LAX, Paris has CDG and ORY, Rome has FCO and CIA. The user didn't specify which airport, just the city. So the Search_Flight_Location will return possible airports, and I'll have to pick the main one, probably the city code. But the user might not know the exact airport, so the function should handle city names and return the main airport's ID. So first, I'll call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs for the multi-stop search. The legs array will have three entries: LA to Paris on Sept 18, Paris to Rome on Sept 19, and Rome to LA on Oct 2. The cabin class is economy, and they want the cheapest. The sort parameter should be CHEAPEST. Adults is 1 by default, but the user didn't mention children, so that's optional.

After getting the flight search results, the response should include tokens for each flight. Then, using those tokens, call Get_Flight_Details to retrieve baggage allowances and other details. But the initial step is to get the flight options, then details. However, the user's query is to check the details of the flights, so maybe the first step is to perform the search, then use the token from that to get details. Wait, the Get_Flight_Details requires a token from the search flights endpoints. So the process is: first perform the multi-stop search, get the token, then use that token in Get_Flight_Details.

But the user hasn't provided the token yet, so the assistant needs to first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the correct parameters, then use the returned token to call Get_Flight_Details. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only call functions based on the user's input. Since the user hasn't provided a token, the assistant can't directly call Get_Flight_Details yet. So the first step is to perform the multi-stop search, which will return flight options with tokens, and then the assistant can use that token in a subsequent step. But since the user is asking to check the details, maybe the assistant should first perform the search, then immediately call Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search result. However, in the current tool setup, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, no, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. Let me check the instructions again.

The user says: "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. Then use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Then, take the token from that response to call Get_Flight_Details. But how to handle this in the tool calls? Because each tool call's output is the input for the next. However, in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to generate the tool calls based on the user's input, not knowing the actual response data. So the assistant has to first get the location IDs, then proceed with the flight search, then get the details. But since the assistant can't execute the calls in sequence (as it's a single interaction), perhaps the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs, then use those IDs in the multi-stop search, and then use the token from that to get flight details. But since the assistant can't execute code, it's up to the system to handle the sequence. So the assistant's first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

Wait, but the user's query is to check the flight details for their itinerary. So the assistant needs to first find the flights, then get their details. But to get the flight details, the token from the search is needed. Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the correct parameters (using the location IDs obtained from Search_Flight_Location), then use the token from that response to call Get_Flight_Details. However, in the current tool setup, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. But how? Because the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops depend on the outputs of Search_Flight_Location. So the assistant has to first get the location IDs, then proceed. But since the user hasn't provided those IDs, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

So the first tool calls should be three instances of Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles, Paris, and Rome. Then, using the IDs from those responses, construct the legs for the multi-stop search. Then, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those legs, and then call Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search response.

But in the current setup, the assistant can only make tool calls based on the user's input, not on previous tool responses. Therefore, the assistant must first ask the user to provide the location IDs, but the user doesn't have them. Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs. However, the assistant can chain the tool calls. Wait, according to the instructions, the assistant can call multiple functions in the response. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city, then once those are done, proceed to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, and then Get_Flight_Details. But since the assistant can't wait for the responses, perhaps the correct approach is to first call Search_Flight_Location for each city, then in the same response, after getting those IDs, proceed to the multi-stop search and then get details. However, in reality, the system would handle the dependencies, but the assistant must structure the tool calls in order.

But given the way the tools are set up, the assistant needs to first get the location IDs. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. Let's structure that.

First, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get the ID for LA. Then, call it again with "Paris" and then "Rome". Once those IDs are obtained, they can be used in the legs for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Then, after getting the flight search results (which include a token), call Get_Flight_Details with that token.

So the assistant's first set of tool calls would be three instances of Search_Flight_Location for each city. Then, using those IDs, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Then, call Get_Flight_Details with the token from that response.

But in the current setup, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. However, the parameters for each tool call must be known. Since the IDs from Search_Flight_Location are not known until the tool is called, the assistant can't precompute them. Therefore, the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs. However, in the context of a single interaction, the assistant can't know the results of those calls. Therefore, the correct approach is to first call Search_Flight_Location for each city, then proceed with the flight search once the IDs are known. But since the user's query includes all the necessary information to perform these steps, the assistant should generate the tool calls in sequence.

Wait, but the assistant can only make tool calls based on the user's input. The user hasn't provided the IDs, so the assistant must first call Search_Flight_Location to get the IDs. Therefore, the first tool calls are the three Search_Flight_Location calls. Then, once the IDs are obtained, proceed to the multi-stop search. However, in the current setup, the assistant can't chain the calls in a single response. The assistant must output all necessary tool calls in the response, but the system would handle the execution order. Alternatively, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city and wait for the responses, then proceed. But since this is a single interaction, the assistant can only make the initial calls and then the system would handle the rest.

In conclusion, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs, then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function, and then use the token from that response to call Get_Flight_Details. However, since the assistant can only make one set of tool calls per response, perhaps the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for all necessary locations, then proceed with the flight search in a subsequent step once the IDs are available.

But given the user's query, the assistant needs to generate the necessary tool calls. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles, Paris, and Rome. Then, once the IDs are obtained,
