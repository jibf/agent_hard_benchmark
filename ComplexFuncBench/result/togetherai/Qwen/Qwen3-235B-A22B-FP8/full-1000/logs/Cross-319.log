Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they need to take a taxi from 97 Kent Ave to the University of Waterloo in 20 minutes. Since it's 11 AM on December 1st, 2024, the first taxi should be arranged for 11:20 AM. Then, at 3 PM, they need another taxi to a shopping mall in a nearby city around the university.

First, I need to find the Google Place IDs for both locations. The user mentioned "University of Waterloo" and a "shopping mall in a nearby city around University of Waterloo." But wait, the user also mentioned taking a taxi to the university first. So the first trip is from 97 Kent Ave to University of Waterloo. The second trip is from University of Waterloo to a shopping mall in a nearby city.

But to book the taxis, I need the Google Place IDs for both the pick-up and drop-off locations. For the first trip, the pick-up is 97 Kent Ave. I should use the Taxi_Search_Location function to get the Google Place ID for 97 Kent Ave. Similarly, for the University of Waterloo, I need to search for that as well. Then, for the second trip, the drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. However, the user hasn't specified which mall, so maybe I need to find nearby cities first using Get_Nearby_Cities with the coordinates of the University of Waterloo. Once I have nearby cities, I can search for shopping malls in those cities to get the Google Place ID for the mall.

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact mall, so perhaps the second taxi's drop-off is a mall in a nearby city. But the Taxi_Search_Location function requires a query. Maybe the user expects me to pick a nearby city and a mall there. However, the user might not have provided enough info, but since the task is to arrange the taxis, I need to proceed with the available info.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects to use the same University of Waterloo area for the second trip but a nearby city. Let me break it down:

1. For the first taxi:
   - Pick-up: 97 Kent Ave. Need GooglePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.
   - Drop-off: University of Waterloo. Need GooglePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.

2. For the second taxi:
   - Pick-up: University of Waterloo (same as previous drop-off, so same GooglePlaceId)
   - Drop-off: Shopping mall in a nearby city. Need to find nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities with coordinates of University of Waterloo. Then, for each nearby city, get the GooglePlaceId for a shopping mall there. But the user hasn't specified which mall, so perhaps just pick one, but the function requires a query. Maybe the user expects to input a mall name, but since it's not given, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available info, maybe using a default query like "shopping mall near [city]".

But the problem is that the Taxi_Search_Location function requires a query parameter. So for the second drop-off, the user says "shopping mall in a nearby city around University of Waterloo." So first, get nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities with the coordinates of University of Waterloo. Then, for each of those cities, use Taxi_Search_Location to find a shopping mall in that city. Then use the GooglePlaceId from that mall as the drop-off.

But how do I get the coordinates of the University of Waterloo? The user hasn't provided them. The Get_Nearby_Cities function requires longitude and latitude. So perhaps first, I need to get the coordinates of the University of Waterloo using the Taxi_Search_Location function. Wait, Taxi_Search_Location returns GooglePlaceId, but to get coordinates, maybe another function is needed. Wait, looking at the tools provided:

The Get_Nearby_Cities function requires longitude and latitude, which can be obtained from the Meta collection's locationToLatLong endpoint. But the user hasn't provided that. Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location function returns the coordinates as well? Let me check the tools again.

Looking at the Taxi_Search_Location function's description: it's to find the googlePlaceId for taxi locations. The parameters are a query. The response probably includes the googlePlaceId, but not the coordinates. The Meta collection's locationToLatLong function isn't listed here. Wait, the tools provided include:

- Get_Nearby_Cities: requires longitude and latitude from Meta's locationToLatLong.

But the Meta functions aren't listed here. Wait, the user provided tools include:

The Get_Nearby_Cities function's parameters are longitude and latitude, which can be retrieved from Meta's locationToLatLong endpoint. However, the Meta functions aren't in the provided tools. Wait, looking at the tools section:

The tools listed are:

- Search_Attractions
- Taxi_Search_Location
- Search_Taxi
- Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops
- Get_Nearby_Cities

The Get_Nearby_Cities function requires longitude and latitude, which can be obtained from Meta's locationToLatLong endpoint, but that Meta function isn't in the tools provided. So perhaps the user expects that the assistant can get the coordinates through some other means, but given the tools, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location can be used to get the GooglePlaceId for the University of Waterloo, and then perhaps another step to get its coordinates. However, without the Meta function, this might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location returns the coordinates, but according to the tool's description, it's only for getting the GooglePlaceId.

This seems like a problem. Without the Meta function to get coordinates, how can we use Get_Nearby_Cities? The user might have made a mistake in the tools, but assuming that the tools are correct, perhaps the University of Waterloo's GooglePlaceId can be used to get its coordinates via another method not specified here, but since the tools don't include that, maybe we have to proceed differently.

Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location function returns enough information to get the coordinates. But according to the tool's description, it's to get the GooglePlaceId. So perhaps the assistant can't get the coordinates directly, making the Get_Nearby_Cities function unusable. However, the user's request requires arranging the second taxi to a nearby city's mall, so the assistant must proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the second taxi's drop-off can be a shopping mall in the same city as the University of Waterloo, but the user specified "nearby city." So perhaps the assistant should proceed as follows:

1. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "97 Kent Ave" to get pick_up_place_id for the first taxi.
2. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "University of Waterloo" to get drop_off_place_id for the first taxi.
3. For the second taxi, the drop-off is a shopping mall in a nearby city. To find nearby cities, need coordinates of University of Waterloo. But without Meta's locationToLatLong, perhaps the assistant can't get the coordinates. However, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location for University of Waterloo returns a GooglePlaceId which includes coordinates, but the tool's description doesn't mention that. Since the tools don't include a way to get coordinates, maybe the assistant has to assume that the user can provide the coordinates, but in this case, the user hasn't. This is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed without the Get_Nearby_Cities step and directly search for a shopping mall in a nearby city by using Taxi_Search_Location with a query like "shopping mall near University of Waterloo" or in a specific nearby city. But the user's instruction says "shopping mall in a nearby city around University of Waterloo," so the assistant needs to first find nearby cities.

Given the constraints of the provided tools, perhaps the assistant can't proceed with Get_Nearby_Cities because it lacks the longitude and latitude. Therefore, the assistant might have to make an assumption or proceed without that step. However, the user's request explicitly mentions a nearby city, so the assistant must find a way.

Wait, looking back at the tools, the Get_Nearby_Cities function's parameters are longitude and latitude, which can be retrieved from Meta's locationToLatLong endpoint. But the Meta functions aren't listed in the tools provided. Therefore, the assistant can't use Get_Nearby_Cities because it doesn't have access to the coordinates. This is a dead end.

Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location function returns the coordinates as part of the GooglePlaceId data. If that's the case, then after getting the GooglePlaceId for University of Waterloo, the assistant could extract the coordinates from there. However, the tool's description doesn't mention that. The tool's description says it's to find the GooglePlaceId, which is a string identifier for the location.

Given the tools provided, perhaps the assistant can't retrieve the coordinates, making the Get_Nearby_Cities function unusable. Therefore, the assistant might have to proceed without it, perhaps by searching for a shopping mall directly in the same city as the University of Waterloo, but the user specified a nearby city. This is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can proceed by using the Taxi_Search_Location for the second drop-off with a query like "shopping mall in Kitchener" (assuming Kitchener is a nearby city to Waterloo), but the user hasn't specified which city. However, Waterloo, Ontario is a real place, and nearby cities include Kitchener, Cambridge, etc. But the assistant shouldn't assume real-world knowledge unless instructed.

Given the tools, the assistant must use the functions provided. So steps:
