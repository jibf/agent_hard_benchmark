Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user wants their friends to stay in a beachfront hotel near the British Museum in London from December 1st to 6th, 2024. Then, they need to find nearby cities around the hotel for further travel plans.

First, I need to find the hotel. The user specified London and the British Museum. The available functions include Search_Hotel_Destination, which can get the location details. So, I should start by using Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "British Museum, London" to get the dest_id and other necessary parameters.

Once I have the destination info, the next step is to search for hotels using Search_Hotels. The parameters required are search_type, arrival_date, departure_date, dest_id, and possibly categories_filter for beachfront. But wait, the categories_filter needs to be obtained from Get_Filter. However, the user mentioned a beachfront hotel, so I need to check if "beachfront" is a valid category. Since the Get_Filter function can provide the categories_filter, maybe I should first call Get_Filter with the search_type and dest_id from the initial search. But the Get_Filter requires parameters like search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. However, the user hasn't provided all these details yet. Wait, the Search_Hotels function requires search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, and departure_date. The dates are given as December 1st to 6th, 2024. So, arrival_date is 2024-12-01 and departure_date is 2024-12-06. The room_qty defaults to 1, and adults to 1, but since it's friends, maybe more adults, but the user didn't specify, so stick to defaults unless told otherwise.

But the user wants a beachfront hotel. The categories_filter is needed here. To get that, I need to call Get_Filter. But Get_Filter requires parameters like search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date. So first, I need to get the dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination. Let me structure this:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London" to get dest_id and search_type.
2. Then, use that dest_id and search_type along with arrival_date and departure_date to call Get_Filter, which might return the categories_filter that includes beachfront.
3. Then, use Search_Hotels with the parameters including categories_filter set to beachfront, if available.

Wait, but the Get_Filter's description says it's to get the categories_filter parameter. However, the user might not know the exact filter name. So maybe the Get_Filter will list available categories, and "beachfront" might be one of them. But how to ensure that? The user might have to specify, but since they want a beachfront hotel, I can proceed by first getting the filter options and then applying the beachfront filter.

However, the initial step is to get the destination. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London". The response should give me the dest_id and search_type. Then, proceed to Get_Filter with those parameters plus dates and room details. Then, from Get_Filter's response, get the categories_filter that corresponds to beachfront. Then, use that in Search_Hotels.

But the user also wants to find nearby cities around the hotel. For that, after getting the hotel's coordinates (latitude and longitude), use Get_Nearby_Cities. However, the Search_Hotels function's response might include the hotel's coordinates. Alternatively, if the hotel's coordinates are not available from the search, maybe another function is needed. But according to the tools provided, Get_Nearby_Cities requires latitude and longitude, which can be obtained from the hotel's details. But the tools don't include a function to get hotel details by ID, so maybe the Search_Hotels response includes the coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps the initial Search_Hotel_Destination gives the coordinates. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination's description says it returns latitude and longitude for the search query. Wait, the user is looking for a hotel near the British Museum, which is in London. The Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London" would return the coordinates for that area. But the hotel itself might have its own coordinates. Hmm, but maybe the Get_Nearby_Cities needs the coordinates of the hotel's location. If the Search_Hotels function returns the hotel's coordinates, then after finding the hotel, we can use those. But if not, perhaps the initial destination's coordinates can be used as a proxy. However, the user wants cities near the hotel, so ideally, the hotel's exact coordinates are needed.

Assuming that the Search_Hotels function returns the hotel's latitude and longitude, then after getting the hotel data, we can extract those coordinates and pass them to Get_Nearby_Cities. But since the tools don't include a function to get hotel details by ID, maybe the Search_Hotels response includes those details. Alternatively, perhaps the initial Search_Hotel_Destination's coordinates are sufficient if the hotel is in that area.

This is a bit of a challenge. Let's outline the steps again:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London" to get dest_id and coordinates.
2. Use Get_Filter with the dest_id, search_type, dates, etc., to get categories_filter options.
3. If "beachfront" is a valid category, use it in Search_Hotels with the parameters including categories_filter=beachfront, dates, dest_id, etc.
4. From the Search_Hotels response, get the hotel's coordinates (assuming it's included).
5. Use Get_Nearby_Cities with the hotel's coordinates to find nearby cities.

But the problem is whether the Search_Hotels function's response includes the hotel's latitude and longitude. The tool's description for Search_Hotels doesn't mention returning coordinates, but the Search_Hotel_Destination does. So maybe the initial Search_Hotel_Destination gives the coordinates of the destination (British Museum area), and the hotel is in that area. Then, Get_Nearby_Cities can use those coordinates. However, the user wants cities near the hotel, not the destination. If the hotel's coordinates aren't available, using the destination's coordinates might be the best approximation.

Alternatively, maybe the user's request is to find a hotel near the British Museum that is beachfront, and then find nearby cities around that hotel's location. Without the hotel's exact coordinates, this might not be possible. But given the available tools, perhaps the best approach is to first get the destination's coordinates, then use Get_Nearby_Cities with those. However, that might not be accurate if the hotel is in a different area. But given the tools provided, this might be the only way.

Wait, the Get_Nearby_Cities function requires latitude and longitude. These can be obtained from the Search_Hotel_Destination response. So, first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "British Museum, London" to get the latitude and longitude. Then, after finding the hotel (using Search_Hotels with the dest_id), use the same latitude and longitude to find nearby cities. Alternatively, if the hotel's coordinates are different, but we can't retrieve them, then we proceed with the destination's coordinates.

So, the steps would be:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London" to get dest_id and coordinates.
2. Call Get_Filter with the necessary parameters (search_type, dest_id, dates, etc.) to get the categories_filter for beachfront.
3. Call Search_Hotels with the parameters including categories_filter set to beachfront, dates, dest_id, etc.
4. Then, call Get_Nearby_Cities with the latitude and longitude from step 1 to find nearby cities.

But the user wants cities around the hotel, not the destination. If the hotel is in the same area as the destination's coordinates, then this works. Otherwise, it's not accurate. However, given the available tools, this might be the best approach.

Now, let's structure the function calls:

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London". The response will give dest_id and coordinates.

Then, to get the categories_filter for beachfront, call Get_Filter with search_type, dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. But the Get_Filter requires search_type, dest_id, departure_date, arrival_date. The dates are 2024-12-01 and 2024-12-06. The room_qty defaults to 1, adults to 1, but the user might have more friends. However, the user didn't specify the number of adults or rooms, so we'll use defaults unless told otherwise.

Once Get_Filter is called, the response might include categories_filter options. Assuming "beachfront" is a valid category, then proceed to call Search_Hotels with categories_filter set to beachfront, sort_by parameters, etc.

Finally, use the coordinates from Search_Hotel_Destination to call Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities.

But the user might need to filter for beachfront hotels. However, the Get_Filter's parameters include categories_filter, which is retrieved from the endpoint. The initial Get_Filter call might return available categories, and the user can select "beachfront" from there. But since the user explicitly asked for a beachfront hotel, we can assume that the categories_filter can be set to "beachfront".

Putting it all together:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "British Museum, London
