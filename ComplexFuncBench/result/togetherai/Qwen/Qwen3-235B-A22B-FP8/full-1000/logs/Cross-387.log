2025-08-13 20:32:37,755 - evaluation_logger_Cross-387 - INFO - Query: I'm going to have a meeting at the FTX Arena in Miami on November 30, 2024. After the meeting ends at 5 PM, I will fly from Miami to Orlando for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Orlando after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 30 kilometers of the airport in Orlando and check what fun places there are around the hotel.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. The user has a meeting at FTX Arena in Miami on November 30, 2024, ending at 5 PM. They need to fly to Orlando after that, so the flight should be after 5 PM. They also need a taxi to the airport right after the meeting, a hotel near Orlando airport within 30 km, and info on nearby attractions.

First, I need to find the airport codes for Miami and Orlando. The user mentioned FTX Arena in Miami, which is likely Miami International Airport (MIA). Orlando's airport is Orlando International Airport (MCO). But I should confirm using the Search_Flight_Location function for both cities to get the correct IDs.

Next, search for flights from Miami to Orlando on November 30, departing after 5 PM. The earliest flight possible. The Search_Flights function requires fromId, toId, departDate, and other optional parameters. So first, get the fromId (Miami) and toId (Orlando) using Search_Flight_Location.

Then, after getting the flight info, the user needs a taxi. For that, the Taxi_Search_Location function is needed for both pickup (FTX Arena in Miami) and drop-off (Orlando airport). But wait, the taxi is to take them to the airport in Miami, right? Because they're flying from Miami to Orlando. Wait, no. Wait, the user is in Miami for the meeting, then after the meeting ends at 5 PM, they need to go to Miami airport to fly to Orlando. So the taxi is from FTX Arena (Miami) to Miami International Airport. Then, after arriving in Orlando, they need a hotel near Orlando airport. So the hotel search is in Orlando, within 30 km of the airport. For that, use Search_Hotel_Destination to get the coordinates of Orlando, then use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the coordinates and radius 30 km. Then, once a hotel is found, get nearby attractions using Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id.

But the user also wants to check availability of attractions. Wait, the user mentioned "check what fun places there are around the hotel." So maybe Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By is sufficient. But maybe also check availability calendar for those attractions. However, the user didn't specify which attractions, so perhaps just getting the list is enough.

So the steps are:

1. Find Miami airport's ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami".
2. Find Orlando airport's ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Orlando".
3. Search flights from Miami to Orlando on Nov 30, departing after 5 PM. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, sorted by earliest (maybe sort by FASTEST or BEST? The user wants earliest, so maybe BEST might include earliest, but the parameters for sort are BEST, CHEAPEST, or FASTEST. The description says "orders result by BEST, CHEAPEST or FASTEST flights." So perhaps BEST might prioritize earliest available. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to specify FASTEST for shortest duration, but the user wants the earliest departure. Since the sort options don't include earliest, maybe the API defaults to earliest when using BEST. Not sure, but proceed with BEST.
4. Once flight is found, the user needs a taxi from FTX Arena in Miami to the airport. So use Taxi_Search_Location for pickup (FTX Arena, Miami) and drop-off (Miami airport). Wait, but the flight is from Miami to Orlando, so the taxi is taking them to Miami airport. Then, after arriving in Orlando, they need a hotel near Orlando airport. So for the hotel, use Search_Hotel_Destination for Orlando to get coordinates, then Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 30 km. Then, use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id from the hotel search.

But the user's request is to call a taxi to take them to the airport right after the meeting. So the taxi is from the meeting location (FTX Arena, Miami) to the Miami airport. So need to get the googlePlaceId for both locations using Taxi_Search_Location.

Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location function's parameters are a query string. So for pickup, query "FTX Arena, Miami" and for drop-off, query "Orlando International Airport" (but wait, no, the user is flying from Miami to Orlando, so the taxi is to Miami airport. The drop-off for the taxi is the airport in Miami. So the drop-off is Miami International Airport. So the Taxi_Search_Location for drop-off would be "Miami International Airport".

So steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for "Miami" to get fromId.
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get toId.
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-30, sort=BEST (or maybe FASTEST?), adults=1 (unless specified otherwise).
4. Then, for the taxi, use Taxi_Search_Location for pickup "FTX Arena, Miami" and drop-off "Miami International Airport".
5. Then, after arriving in Orlando, search for hotels near Orlando airport. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Orlando" to get coordinates, then Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date (the date they arrive in Orlando, which would be Nov 30 if the flight is direct? Assuming the flight is on Nov 30 departing at 5 PM, arrival in Orlando would be same day, so arrival_date=2024-11-30, departure_date=next day? Or how many days is the vacation? The user didn't specify, so maybe default to 1 night. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps need to ask, but since the user wants to book a hotel, maybe assume arrival on Nov 30 and departure on Dec 1. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the assistant should make an assumption and proceed. The user's main request is to find the earliest flight after 5 PM, so the flight would be on Nov 30, arrival in Orlando same day, check-in on Nov 30, check-out next day. So parameters for hotel search: arrival_date=2024-11-30, departure_date=2024-12-01, radius=30 (but the radius is in km, user said 30 km, so radius=30). Also, latitude and longitude from Search_Hotel_Destination for Orlando.

Wait, Search_Hotel_Destination returns latitude and longitude. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Orlando" to get the coordinates. Then use those in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates.

Then, once a hotel is found, use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with hotel_id to find nearby attractions.

So the tool calls needed are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for "Miami" to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" to get toId.
3. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-30, sort=BEST (or FASTEST? To get earliest departure? Maybe the API's BEST might include earliest available. Alternatively, the user wants the earliest flight after 5 PM, so maybe the API will handle that based on departDate and time, but the parameters don't include time. So the user's flight search might need to filter flights departing after 5 PM, but the parameters for Search_Flights don't have a time parameter. So the API might return all flights on that date, and the user would have to select the earliest. But since the tool can't do that, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the available data.

Wait, the Search_Flights function's parameters include departDate but not departTime. So the earliest flight on that date would be the one with the earliest departure time. The sort options are BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST. The user wants the earliest flight possible after 5 PM. The sort by FASTEST would give the shortest duration, but not necessarily the earliest departure. BEST might be a combination of factors. However, the user might need to look through the results for the earliest departure time after 5 PM. But since the assistant can't process the results, it can only call the function and let the backend handle it.

So proceed with calling Search_Flights with departDate=2024-11-30, fromId and toId obtained from the previous steps.

Then, Taxi_Search_Location for pickup (FTX Arena, Miami) and drop-off (Miami International Airport).

Then, Search_Hotel_Destination for Orlando to get coordinates.

Then, Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, radius=30, arrival_date=2024-11-30, departure_date=2024-12-01 (assuming 1 night stay).

Then, Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with hotel_id from the hotel search.

But the user's request is to "call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting". The meeting ends at 5 PM, so the taxi should be scheduled for around 5 PM. The Taxi_Search_Location requires pick_up_date and pick_up_time. The pick_up_date is 2024-11-30, pick_up_time is 17:00 (5 PM). The drop_off_place_id is the Miami airport's googlePlaceId.

But first, need to get the googlePlaceId for FTX Arena
