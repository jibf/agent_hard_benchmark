Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want to check the details of the fastest plane tickets for two separate trips: Toronto to New York on November 8, 2024, and New York to Washington on November 10, 2024. They also need hotel recommendations near the airports in both cities, within 10 kilometers, for their two-day stays. 

Starting with the flights. The user specified the fastest flights, so I need to use the Search_Flights function. But to do that, I need the departure and arrival airport IDs. The function requires fromId and toId, which are obtained from the Search_Flight_Location endpoint. So first, I should search for the airport IDs for Toronto, New York, and Washington.

Wait, the user mentioned New York and Washington. Are there multiple airports in those cities? For example, New York has JFK, LGA, EWR. The user might not specify which airport, so the Search_Flight_Location with the city name should return the relevant airports. Let me first get the IDs for Toronto, New York City, and Washington D.C.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto. Then for New York City, and then for Washington D.C. Once I have the IDs, I can proceed to search flights for each leg. The first flight is Toronto (fromId) to New York (toId) on Nov 8. The second flight is New York (fromId) to Washington (toId) on Nov 10. 

After getting the flight details, the user needs hotels near the arrival airports in New York and Washington. For that, I need the coordinates of the arrival airports. Wait, but the hotels are based on the arrival airports of the flights. So after getting the flight details, maybe the arrival airport's coordinates can be obtained from the flight data? Or perhaps the Search_Flights function returns the airport details, including coordinates? Hmm, but according to the function definitions, the Get_Flight_Details might include such information. Alternatively, maybe after getting the flight search results, the arrival airport's coordinates can be retrieved via another function. But looking at the available tools, there's Location_to_Lat_Long which can get coordinates from a location name. But the user wants hotels near the arrival airports, so perhaps the airport's coordinates are needed. 

Wait, the user says "based on the arrival airports of the flights". So once the flights are searched, the arrival airport's ID is known. Then, perhaps using the airport's ID, get its coordinates. But the available functions don't have a direct way to get coordinates from an airport ID. Alternatively, maybe the airport's ID can be used as a query in the Location_to_Lat_Long function. Let me check the functions again.

The Location_to_Lat_Long function takes a query parameter, which can be names of locations, airports, etc. So perhaps after getting the airport ID (like 'JFK'), I can use that as the query to get the coordinates. Or maybe the airport's name is part of the response from Search_Flight_Location. Let me think.

First, for each flight leg, I need to get the flight details. Let's outline the steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get fromId for the first flight.
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for New York City to get toId for the first flight.
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId (Toronto), toId (New York), departDate 2024-11-08, sorted by FASTEST.
4. Then, use Search_Flight_Location for Washington D.C. to get toId for the second flight.
5. Use Search_Flights again with fromId (New York), toId (Washington), departDate 2024-11-10, sorted by FASTEST.
6. For each arrival airport (New York and Washington), get their coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long, using the airport's ID or name.
7. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the coordinates, arrival and departure dates (2 days stay), radius 10 km.

But wait, the user is staying in New York and Washington for two days each. So for the first hotel in New York, arrival date is Nov 8, departure is Nov 10 (since they leave on the 10th for Washington). Then in Washington, arrival on Nov 10, departure Nov 12? Wait, the user says "stay in New York and Washington for two days each." The first flight arrives in New York on Nov 8, stays two days (leaving Nov 10), then flies to Washington on Nov 10, stays two days (leaving Nov 12). So hotel in New York: arrival 2024-11-08, departure 2024-11-10. Hotel in Washington: arrival 2024-11-10, departure 2024-11-12.

But the user might need the hotels near the arrival airports. So for the first flight's arrival airport in New York (e.g., JFK), get coordinates, then search hotels there. For the second flight's arrival airport in Washington (e.g., IAD), get coordinates and search hotels.

But how to get the airport's coordinates? The Search_Flight_Location might return the airport's name, city, and maybe coordinates? Let me check the function definitions.

The Search_Flight_Location function's description says it finds airports by location, etc., and returns their IDs. The parameters require a query, and the response probably includes airport details like id, name, city, etc. However, the function's response isn't specified here. But since the user needs the coordinates of the arrival airports, perhaps after getting the flight details, we can extract the airport's name or code and then use Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the Get_Flight_Details function returns the airport's coordinates. Let me check the functions again.

The Get_Flight_Details function's parameters require a token from the search flights, and it returns details like baggage, prices, etc. Not sure if it includes airport coordinates. The available tools don't have a function that directly gets airport coordinates from flight data. Therefore, perhaps the approach is to use the airport code (like JFK) as the query in Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates.

So steps:

For each flight leg:

1. Search for the departure and arrival airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location with the city names.
2. Use Search_Flights to get the fastest flights, which will return flight details including arrival airport codes.
3. Use the arrival airport codes in Location_to_Lat_Long to get coordinates.
4. Use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the appropriate dates and radius.

But the user hasn't provided the airport codes, just city names. So first, for Toronto, New York, and Washington, get the airport IDs.

Wait, the user might not know the exact airport codes, so the Search_Flight_Location function with the city name should return possible airports. For example, searching "New York" might return JFK, LGA, EWR. But since the user is looking for the fastest flight, maybe the system will handle which airport is best. However, the assistant needs to proceed with the available functions.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their respective IDs.

Let me outline the tool calls step by step.

First, get the fromId for Toronto:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto".

Then get toId for New York:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "New York".

Then search flights for Toronto to New York on 2024-11-08, sorted by FASTEST.

Then, for the return flight, get fromId for New York (which we already have from the previous step) and toId for Washington:

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Washington".

Then search flights for New York to Washington on 2024-11-10, sorted by FASTEST.

Once the flights are found, get the arrival airport details (probably the airport code) from the flight search results. Then use Location_to_Lat_Long on the airport's name or code to get coordinates.

For example, if the arrival airport in New York is JFK, then call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "JFK".

Then use those coordinates to search hotels with Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates, with arrival_date 2024-11-08, departure_date 2024-11-10, radius 10 km.

Similarly for Washington: arrival airport (e.g., IAD), call Location_to_Lat_Long with "IAD", then search hotels with arrival 2024-11-10 and departure 2024-11-12.

But since the user wants to book the tickets separately, the assistant needs to handle each flight independently.

Now, considering the tool calls required:

First, for the first flight's departure and arrival locations:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Toronto.
2. Search_Flight_Location for New York.
3. Search_Flights with fromId (Toronto's ID), toId (New York's ID), departDate 2024-11-08, sort FASTEST.

Then, for the second flight:

4. Search_Flight_Location for Washington.
5. Search_Flights with fromId (New York's ID), toId (Washington's ID), departDate 2024-11-10, sort FASTEST.

Assuming the flight search results include the arrival airport's code or name, then:
