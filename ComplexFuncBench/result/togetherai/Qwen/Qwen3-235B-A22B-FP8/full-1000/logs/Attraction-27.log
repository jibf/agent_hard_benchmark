2025-08-13 21:24:53,691 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-27 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Taj Mahal after seeing it on social media. First, I needed to find the right attraction using the Search_Attraction_Location function with "Taj Mahal" as the query. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in Get_Attraction_Details to retrieve more specifics.

Now, looking at the data from Get_Attraction_Details, there's a lot of info here. The description mentions a day trip including the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, which is helpful. The additional info covers accessibility, transportation, and requirements like age for booking. The user might be planning a visit, so I should highlight key points like free cancellation, what's included in the tour, and practical tips.

I should structure the answer to be clear and concise. Start with a brief overview of the attraction, then mention the highlights from the description. Include important details like the operator (RAFAEL TOURS), price, and what's included. Also, note the accessibility features and any recommendations or restrictions. Make sure to mention the free cancellation policy and any terms from Booking.com and Viator. Avoid technical jargon and present it in a friendly, informative way. Let me check if there's anything else the user might need, like how to book or other tips. Since the user found it on social media, maybe they're looking for a quick summary without too much fluff. Alright, time to put it all together.
