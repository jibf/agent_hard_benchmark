2025-08-13 21:23:56,864 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-21 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Arc de Triomphe after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with the query "Arc de Triomphe" to find relevant attractions. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details function to retrieve specific details.

Now, the user probably wants a concise summary of the attraction based on the data obtained. The response from Get_Attraction_Details includes the name, description, additional info, cancellation policy, and other features. I should structure the answer to highlight key points like the tour description, what's included, cancellation terms, and any important notes about accessibility or requirements. I'll make sure to present this information clearly and in a friendly tone, ensuring the user gets all the necessary details without any confusion.
