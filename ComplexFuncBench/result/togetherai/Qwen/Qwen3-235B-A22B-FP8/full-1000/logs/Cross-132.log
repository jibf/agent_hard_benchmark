Okay, let's break down the user's request. They need to book two separate flights: Vancouver to Chicago on Dec 1, 2024, and Chicago to Boston on Dec 3, 2024. They also want hotels near the airports in Chicago and Boston, within 20 km, based on the arrival airports of the flights.

First, I need to find the flight details for both legs. Since they want the fastest flights, I'll use the Search_Flights function with sort set to FASTEST. But to do that, I need the location IDs for Vancouver, Chicago, and Boston airports. So I should start by using Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Wait, the user mentioned booking tickets separately, so each flight is a one-way trip. For the first flight, from Vancouver to Chicago, I'll need fromId as Vancouver's airport ID and toId as Chicago's. Similarly, the second flight is Chicago to Boston, so fromId will be Chicago's and toId Boston's. Departure dates are Dec 1 and Dec 3 respectively. Return dates aren't needed here since they're one-way.

After getting the flight details, the user wants hotels near the arrival airports in Chicago and Boston. But to search for hotels, I need the coordinates of those airports. The Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates function requires latitude and longitude. However, I don't have those yet. So after getting the flight location IDs, I might need to use Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates of the airports. Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location might return the coordinates as part of the airport data? The function description says it finds airports by location, but the parameters only take a query. The response might include the airport's coordinates, but the function's parameters don't specify that. Hmm, maybe the user expects that once the airport is found, we can get its coordinates via another function. So first, use Search_Flight_Location for Chicago and Boston to get their airport details, which might include coordinates, or maybe use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport's name to get the coordinates.

Wait, the Location_to_Lat_Long function's description says it gets latitude and longitude for a location query. So perhaps after finding the airport using Search_Flight_Location, I can take the airport's name or city to get the coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location response includes coordinates. Since the function's parameters don't specify that, I might need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed step by step.

First step: Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs. For example, query "Vancouver" to get fromId for the first flight, "Chicago" to get toId for the first flight and fromId for the second, and "Boston" to get toId for the second flight.

Once I have the flight details, the next step is to find the arrival airports for both flights. Let's say the first flight's arrival airport is O'Hare in Chicago, and the second flight's arrival in Boston is Logan. Then, I need to get the coordinates of O'Hare and Logan airports to search for hotels nearby.

To get the coordinates, I can use the Location_to_Lat_Long function with the airport names as the query. Once I have the latitude and longitude, I can plug those into the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates function with a radius of 20 km (which is 20,000 meters, but the function's radius is in kilometers, so 20 km). The arrival and departure dates for the hotels would be based on the flight dates. For Chicago, arrival is Dec 1, departure is Dec 3 (2 days stay). For Boston, arrival is Dec 3, departure is Dec 5 (assuming two days there as well). Wait, the user said they're staying in Chicago and Boston for two days each. So after arriving in Chicago on Dec 1, they leave on Dec 3 (since Dec 1 and 2 are the two days, but maybe they stay two nights? So check-in on Dec 1, check-out Dec 3). Similarly for Boston: check-in Dec 3, check-out Dec 5. So the hotel search parameters would be arrival_date and departure_date accordingly.

But to get the flight details, I need to first get the tokens from the Search_Flights function for each flight, then use Get_Flight_Details to get more info. However, the user's main request is to check the details of the fastest flights and provide hotels near the arrival airports. So the steps are:

1. Search for each flight's details (fastest) to get the arrival airport information.
2. Use the arrival airport's coordinates to search for hotels nearby.
3. Provide the flight details and hotel options.

But to get the flight details, I need to first get the location IDs for the airports. Let's outline the function calls:

First, for each city, get the flight location IDs:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Vancouver" to get fromId for first flight.
- Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get toId for first flight and fromId for second flight.
- Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston" to get toId for second flight.

Assuming the responses include the airport IDs and possibly names. Then, call Search_Flights for each leg with sort=FASTEST, using the respective IDs and dates.

Once the flights are found, extract the arrival airport codes (e.g., ORD for Chicago, BOS for Boston). Then, use Location_to_Lat_Long with queries like "O'Hare Airport" and "Logan Airport" to get their coordinates. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 20 km, and the appropriate dates.

Wait, but the user said "based on the arrival airports of the flights". So the hotel search should be around the arrival airport of each flight. So for the first flight, arrival is Chicago's airport, so hotels in Chicago near that airport. Second flight arrival is Boston's airport, hotels there.

So the plan is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs.
2. Use Search_Flights for each leg (Vancouver to Chicago, Chicago to Boston) with sort=FASTEST, dates as specified.
3. From the flight results, get the arrival airport codes.
4. Use Location_to_Lat_Long on those airport names to get coordinates.
5. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, dates of stay, and radius 20 km.

But since the user wants to book tickets separately, maybe they need the flight details first, then the hotels. So each step depends on the previous. However, the user might not have provided existing flight data, so the assistant needs to simulate the function calls in order.

But according to the problem, the assistant needs to call the functions as per the available tools. So the first step is to get the location IDs for the cities.

So first, three calls to Search_Flight_Location:

- Query: Vancouver
- Query: Chicago
- Query: Boston

Then, use the fromId and toId for the flights. Then, call Search_Flights for each leg. Then, get the tokens from those flight searches to get flight details (but the user wants the details of the fastest flights, so maybe the initial search with sort=FASTEST will return the necessary info, or maybe Get_Flight_Details is needed for more info). Then, extract the arrival airport names from the flight results, get their coordinates, then search hotels.

But the user's instruction says to call one or more functions. Since the assistant can't actually execute them, it needs to list the necessary function calls in order.

So the assistant should start by calling Search_Flight_Location for each city. Then proceed with Search_Flights for each flight leg, then get the arrival airports' coordinates, then hotel searches.

But since the user hasn't provided any existing tokens or flight data, the assistant must start from the beginning.

So the first set of function calls would be three Search_Flight_Location calls for Vancouver, Chicago, and Boston.

Wait, but the user might not need all three immediately. The first flight is Vancouver to Chicago, so first get fromId (Vancouver) and toId (Chicago). Then the second flight is Chicago to Boston, so fromId (Chicago) and toId (Boston). So the assistant needs to first get all three location IDs.

Therefore, the first three tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location with query "Vancouver"
2. Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago"
3. Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston"

Assuming each returns the respective airport's ID.

Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights function for each leg.

So next, two Search_Flights calls:

4. For the first leg: fromId (Vancouver's ID), toId (Chicago's ID), departDate 2024-12-01, sort=FASTEST.

5. For the second leg: fromId (Chicago's ID), toId (Boston's ID), departDate 2024-12-03, sort=FASTEST.

Assuming these return flight details, including the arrival airport codes (e.g., Chicago's airport code like ORD, Boston's like BOS).

Then, for each arrival airport, get coordinates:

6. Search for coordinates of ORD (Chicago's airport) using Location_to_Lat_Long with query "O'Hare Airport" (assuming ORD is O'Hare).
7. Search for coordinates of BOS (Boston's airport) using Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Logan Airport".

Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates:
