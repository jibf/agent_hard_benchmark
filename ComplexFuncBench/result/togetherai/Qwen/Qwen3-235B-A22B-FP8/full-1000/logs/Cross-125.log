2025-08-13 19:05:38,285 - evaluation_logger_Cross-125 - INFO - Query: Find me the best-priced interlining flight around December 15, 2024, departing from Edmonton with stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, and then continuing to Toronto. I'll be staying a week in each city, so I need the most affordable hotel recommendations in Ottawa and Vancouver.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They need a multi-stop flight from Edmonton to Ottawa, then Vancouver, then Toronto, around December 15, 2024. They also want affordable hotels in Ottawa and Vancouver for a week each.

First, for the flights: The user mentioned interlining with stops in Ottawa and Vancouver. So, the flight legs would be Edmonton to Ottawa, Ottawa to Vancouver, and Vancouver to Toronto. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function is needed here. I need to structure the legs array with each leg's fromId, toId, and date. But wait, the dates for each leg? Since they're staying a week in each city, the first leg is Dec 15, then the next leg would be Dec 22 (a week later), and then another week later, Dec 29. But the API might handle the dates around the query date. Wait, the user said "around December 15," so maybe the first leg is Dec 15, and the API returns prices within 5 days before and after. But the subsequent legs would need to be after that. Hmm, maybe the API allows specifying the dates for each leg. Let me check the function parameters. The legs array requires each leg to have a date. So I need to set each leg's date as Dec 15, Dec 22, and Dec 29. But the user might not have specified exact dates for each leg, just the initial departure. This could be a problem. Maybe the user wants the initial departure around Dec 15, and then each subsequent leg a week later. So I'll set the dates accordingly. But the API's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, but the function is for multi-stops, so maybe each leg's date is fixed. Or maybe the API allows for the initial date and then the stops are determined by that. Not sure. The example in the parameters shows legs with specific dates. So I'll proceed by setting each leg's date as Dec 15, Dec 22, and Dec 29. But the user might not have specified the dates for each leg, just the initial date. However, the function requires each leg to have a date. So perhaps the user expects the initial date to be Dec 15, and each subsequent leg a week later. So I'll structure the legs with those dates.

Next, the cabin class isn't specified, so maybe we can omit that parameter unless the user prefers economy. The required parameter is legs, so that's covered.

Now, for the hotels in Ottawa and Vancouver. The user wants the most affordable options. So we need to use the Search_Hotels function. To do that, we need dest_id for each city. So first, we need to get the dest_id for Ottawa and Vancouver using Search_Hotel_Destination. But the user hasn't provided the destination IDs, so the assistant should first call Search_Hotel_Destination for Ottawa and Vancouver to get their dest_ids. Then, use those dest_ids in Search_Hotels with parameters like sort_by: price, and set the dates for a week stay. However, the user hasn't specified exact dates for the hotel stays, but since the flights are around Dec 15, maybe the arrival_date for Ottawa would be Dec 15, departure Dec 22, then Vancouver arrival Dec 22, departure Dec 29. So the Search_Hotels would need arrival and departure dates for each city. Also, parameters like adults, room_qty, etc., but the user didn't specify, so default values might be used (e.g., adults: 1, room_qty: 1). Also, price_min and price_max could be set to filter the most affordable options. However, the user might not have specified a price range, so maybe omit those or set a reasonable max. But the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So first, the assistant needs to get the dest_ids for Ottawa and Vancouver via Search_Hotel_Destination. Then, use those IDs in Search_Hotels with appropriate dates and sort_by: price.

But the user's query requires both flight and hotel searches. Since the assistant can call multiple functions, the plan is:

1. Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs Edmonton to Ottawa (Dec 15), Ottawa to Vancouver (Dec 22), Vancouver to Toronto (Dec 29). Need to get the airport IDs for each city using Search_Flight_Location first.

Wait, the fromId and toId in the legs are airport IDs. So the user provided city names, so the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs for Edmonton, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Toronto using Search_Flight_Location. For example, Edmonton's airport code is YEG, so the fromId would be YEG.AIRPORT. Similarly, Ottawa is YOW, Vancouver YVR, Toronto YYZ. But the assistant needs to confirm by calling Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their respective IDs.

So the steps are:

For Flights:

a. Call Search_Flight_Location for Edmonton to get fromId (e.g., YEG.AIRPORT).
b. Call Search_Flight_Location for Ottawa to get toId (YOW.AIRPORT) and fromId for the next leg.
c. Call Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver to get toId (YVR.AIRPORT) and fromId for the next leg.
d. Call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get toId (YYZ.AIRPORT).
e. Then, call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array containing each leg's fromId, toId, and date.

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates for each leg beyond the initial departure around Dec 15. Assuming each stay is a week, the dates would be Dec 15, Dec 22, and Dec 29. So the legs would be:

[
  {fromId: YEG.AIRPORT, toId: YOW.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-15},
  {fromId: YOW.AIRPORT, toId: YVR.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-22},
  {fromId: YVR.AIRPORT, toId: YYZ.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-29}
]

But the API's Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns prices within 5 days before and after the query date. However, each leg's date is fixed here. Maybe the API allows for each leg's date to be adjusted, but the user wants the best price around those dates. So the function call would use those dates, and the API would find the min price within Â±5 days for each leg? Or does the API handle each leg's date as a fixed point? The description says "lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." But each leg has its own date. So perhaps the API will search around each leg's date. However, the user wants the best price around December 15 for the entire multi-stop journey. This might be complex, but according to the function's description, it's designed for that.

For Hotels:

For Ottawa and Vancouver, need to:

a. Call Search_Hotel_Destination for Ottawa to get dest_id.
b. Call Search_Hotel_Destination for Vancouver to get dest_id.
c. Then, call Search_Hotels for each dest_id with arrival_date and departure_date (e.g., Ottawa: arrival 2024-12-15, departure 2024-12-22; Vancouver: arrival 2024-12-22, departure 2024-12-29), sort_by: price, and other default parameters.

But the user hasn't provided dates for hotels, but since they're staying a week in each city, the dates would align with the flight legs. So the hotel stays would be from the arrival date in each city until the next flight departure.

So the assistant needs to make multiple function calls. However, the current step is to determine which functions to call. Since the user's query requires both flight and hotel information, the assistant should first handle the flight part and then the hotels.

But the user's initial query might require multiple tool calls. However, the assistant can only call one function per turn. Wait, the instructions say "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So in one response, the assistant can make multiple tool calls. But in the example, each tool call is in separate XML tags. So the assistant can chain the necessary function calls.

But to get the flight info, first, the assistant needs to get the airport IDs for each city. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city. Then, use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

Similarly, for hotels, call Search_Hotel_Destination for Ottawa and Vancouver to get dest_ids, then use those in Search_Hotels.

But since the user's query is asking for both flights and hotels, the assistant needs to make all these calls. However, in the current setup, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response.

But the assistant should structure the tool calls in order. However, the assistant might need to first get the location IDs before proceeding to the flight and hotel searches.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city (Edmonton, Ottawa, Vancouver, Toronto) to get their airport IDs. Then, use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.

Then, for hotels,
