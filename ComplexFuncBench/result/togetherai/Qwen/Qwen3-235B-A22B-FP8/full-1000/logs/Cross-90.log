Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want to fly from Munich to Frankfurt on November 18, 2024, and they need the best air tickets. Then, they need taxi arrangements to and from the airports.

Starting with the flights: The user mentioned leaving Munich for Frankfurt, so I need to get the flight details. The function Search_Flights requires fromId, toId, and departDate. I don't have the airport IDs yet, so I should first use Search_Flight_Location to find the airports for Munich and Frankfurt. 

Wait, the user might not know the exact airport codes, so querying the searchDestination endpoint for both cities will give the correct IDs. Once I have fromId (Munich) and toId (Frankfurt), I can call Search_Flights with the departDate as 2024-11-18. The user wants the best tickets, so sort by BEST. Also, check if they need return date, but since they mentioned visiting friends and the taxi to the hotel, maybe it's a one-way trip. But the function requires departDate, and returnDate is optional. So proceed with just departDate.

Next, the taxi arrangements. The user wants a taxi from Munich Marriott Hotel to the airport, leaving at 10 AM. Then, upon arrival in Frankfurt, a taxi should wait at the airport to take them to InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt. 

For the taxi, the function Search_Taxi needs pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. To get these, use Taxi_Search_Location for each location. For Munich Marriott Hotel, query the taxi search location function to get the googlePlaceId. Similarly, for Frankfurt airport and InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt. 

Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location function's parameters require a query. So first, I need to call Taxi_Search_Location for each of the hotel and airport locations to get their googlePlaceIds. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Taxi function for both the departure and arrival taxis.

But the user mentioned two taxi rides: one from Munich hotel to airport, and another from Frankfurt airport to the hotel there. So each taxi ride requires separate Search_Taxi calls. However, the tools provided might need each taxi search to be a separate function call. But the user might need both taxis arranged. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for Munich airport's ID using Search_Flight_Location with query Munich.
2. Search for Frankfurt airport's ID using the same function with query Frankfurt.
3. Use those IDs in Search_Flights to find the best flight on 2024-11-18.
4. For the taxi from Munich Marriott Hotel to Munich airport: 
   a. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Munich Marriott Hotel" to get pick_up_place_id.
   b. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Frankfurt Airport" to get drop_off_place_id for the first taxi? Wait, no. Wait, the first taxi is from Munich hotel to Munich airport, so drop_off_place_id should be Munich airport's googlePlaceId. Wait, but the user is leaving from Munich, so the taxi is taking them from the hotel to the departure airport. Then, upon arrival in Frankfurt, another taxi will take them from Frankfurt airport to their hotel. 

So for the first taxi (Munich hotel to Munich airport):
- pick_up_place_id: Munich Marriott Hotel's googlePlaceId
- drop_off_place_id: Munich Airport's googlePlaceId
- pick_up_time: 10:00
- pick_up_date: 2024-11-18

For the second taxi (Frankfurt airport to InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt):
- pick_up_place_id: Frankfurt Airport's googlePlaceId
- drop_off_place_id: InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt's googlePlaceId
- pick_up_time: arrival time of the flight, but the user hasn't specified the flight's arrival time. Hmm, this is a problem. The user hasn't provided the flight's arrival time, so the taxi's pick-up time in Frankfurt can't be determined yet. Maybe the user expects the taxi to wait until the flight lands, but without knowing the flight's arrival time, the taxi can't be scheduled. However, the user might assume that the taxi will be arranged once the flight details are known. But since the flight search is part of the process, perhaps the assistant should first get the flight details, then use the arrival time from the selected flight to book the taxi. However, in the current step, the user is asking to look up the flights and arrange the taxi simultaneously. So maybe the taxi arrangement for Frankfurt arrival needs to be handled after the flight is selected, but the user wants both arranged now. 

This is a bit of a problem. Since the user hasn't provided the flight's arrival time, but the taxi requires pick_up_time and pick_up_date. The user might expect that the taxi will be waiting upon arrival, but without knowing the flight's arrival time, the pick_up_time can't be set. Perhaps the assistant should proceed with the flight search first, then once the flight's arrival time is known, proceed with the taxi booking. However, the user is asking to arrange both the flights and the taxi now. 

In this case, maybe the assistant can proceed with the flight search and the taxi bookings, using the expected arrival time from the flight. But since the flight hasn't been searched yet, the arrival time isn't known. Therefore, the assistant might need to first get the flight details, then use that information to book the taxi. However, the user's request is to help look up the best air tickets and arrange the taxi. So perhaps the assistant can proceed with the flight search and the taxi bookings, but for the Frankfurt taxi, the pick_up_time might be left as a placeholder, but the function requires it. Alternatively, the assistant can make an assumption that the flight arrives at a certain time, but that's risky. 

Alternatively, the assistant can proceed to search for the flights first, then once the flight's arrival time is known, proceed with the taxi booking. However, the user might expect both to be handled in one go. 

Given the tools available, the assistant must call the functions as per the parameters. Since the user hasn't provided the arrival time for Frankfurt, but the taxi requires pick_up_time and pick_up_date, perhaps the assistant can't proceed with the Frankfurt taxi until the flight's arrival time is known. However, the user might have intended that the taxi is arranged once the flight is booked, but since the flight is part of the current request, the assistant might need to first get the flight details, then proceed to book the taxi. 

But the user's message is a single request, so the assistant needs to handle all necessary steps. Therefore, the assistant should first search for the flights, which will return possible options with arrival times. Then, using the selected flight's arrival time, book the taxi in Frankfurt. However, since the assistant can't execute multiple steps in one response, perhaps the assistant should first call the flight search and the necessary location searches for the taxis, then in subsequent steps, proceed with the taxi bookings once flight details are known. 

But according to the problem statement, the assistant should return the function calls needed based on the current user message. So the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls to gather all information required. 

So, first, for the flight search, the assistant needs to get the fromId and toId. Therefore, call Search_Flight_Location for Munich and Frankfurt. Then, use those IDs to search flights. 

For the taxis, the assistant needs to get the googlePlaceIds for Munich Marriott Hotel, Munich Airport, Frankfurt Airport, and InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt. Then, use those to search the taxis. 

But the user hasn't provided the return date, so the flight search doesn't need a returnDate. The departDate is 2024-11-18. The sort is BEST. 

Putting it all together:

First, call Search_Flight_Location for Munich to get fromId.
Then, call Search_Flight_Location for Frankfurt to get toId.
Then, call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, sort by BEST.

For the taxis:

Call Taxi_Search_Location for Munich Marriott Hotel to get its googlePlaceId.
Call Taxi_Search_Location for Munich Airport to get its googlePlaceId.
Call Taxi_Search_Location for Frankfurt Airport to get its googlePlaceId.
Call Taxi_Search_Location for InterContinental Hotel Frankfurt to get its googlePlaceId.

Then, call Search_Taxi for the first ride (hotel to airport) with pick_up_place_id (Munich Marriott), drop_off_place_id (Munich Airport), pick_up_time 10:00, pick_up_date 2024-11-18.

Call Search_Taxi for the second ride (airport to hotel) with pick_up_place_id (Frankfurt Airport), drop_off_place_id (InterContinental Frankfurt), pick_up_time (arrival time from flight), but since the flight's arrival time isn't known yet, this might be a problem. However, the user might expect that the taxi is arranged regardless, perhaps with a flexible time. But the function requires pick_up_time. 

In this case, maybe the assistant can't proceed with the second taxi without knowing the flight's arrival time. Therefore, the assistant should first get the flight details, then use that to book the taxi. But since the user wants both arranged now, perhaps the assistant can proceed with the first taxi (Munich) and then, once the flight is booked, proceed with the Frankfurt taxi. However, the user's request includes both taxis. 

Alternatively, the assistant can make an assumption that the flight arrives at a certain time, but that's not reliable.
