2025-08-13 20:31:27,075 - evaluation_logger_Cross-383 - INFO - Query: I'm going to have a meeting at the United Center in Chicago on November 20, 2024. After the meeting ends at 1 PM, I will fly from Chicago to Miami for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Miami after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 40 kilometers of the airport in Miami and check what fun places there are around the hotel.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. The user has a meeting at the United Center in Chicago on November 20, 2024, ending at 1 PM. They need to fly to Miami after that, so I need to find the earliest flight possible after 1 PM. Then, they need a taxi to the airport, a hotel near Miami Airport within 40 km, and info on nearby attractions.

First, I need to find the correct airport codes for Chicago and Miami. The user mentioned flying from Chicago to Miami, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location function for both cities. For Chicago, the query would be "Chicago" to get the airport ID (probably ORD or MDW), and similarly for Miami, query "Miami" to get MIA or FLL.

Once I have the airport IDs, I can use Search_Flights with fromId as Chicago's airport ID, toId as Miami's, and departDate as 2024-11-20. Since they want the earliest flight after 1 PM, I might need to check if the search results include flights after 13:00. The sort parameter can be set to "FASTEST" or "CHEAPEST" depending on their priority, but the user didn't specify, so maybe default to "FASTEST".

Next, the taxi. They need a taxi from the United Center to the airport. First, I need the googlePlaceId for the United Center. Use Taxi_Search_Location with query "United Center, Chicago". Then, the airport's googlePlaceId would be the same as the airport ID from the flight search? Wait, no. The Taxi_Search_Location might need the airport's name, so maybe after getting the airport ID from Search_Flight_Location, I can use that to get the place ID for the taxi function. Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location's description says it's for pick-up/drop-off locations, so maybe the airport's place ID is needed. But the flight search uses a different ID. Hmm, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location's googlePlaceId is the same as the Google Place ID for the airport. So for O'Hare, the place ID might be different. Need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe after getting the airport ID from the flight search, I can use that in the taxi function, but the parameters for Taxi_Search_Location require a query string. Maybe I need to look up the airport's name again using the flight location's data. For example, if the flight's fromId is ORD, then the airport's name is O'Hare International Airport, so the Taxi_Search_Location query would be "O'Hare International Airport, Chicago".

Wait, the user is going from the United Center to the airport, so pick-up is United Center, drop-off is the airport. So first, get the pick_up_place_id by searching "United Center, Chicago" via Taxi_Search_Location. Then get the drop_off_place_id by searching the airport's name (like "Chicago O'Hare International Airport") via Taxi_Search_Location. Wait, but the user might be flying from either ORD or MDW, depending on the flight. So maybe the taxi drop-off is the same as the flight's departure airport. So after getting the flight's fromId (e.g., ORD), then get the Taxi's drop_off_place_id as the Google Place ID for ORD. So need to first get the flight's fromId and toId, then use those to find the taxi's pick-up and drop-off.

But the user hasn't specified which airport in Chicago they're departing from. The flight search will return flights from either ORD or MDW. Let's assume the earliest flight is from ORD, but the function will handle that. So first, get the flight details, then use the departure airport's name to get the taxi drop-off.

Wait, but the Taxi_Search_Location function's parameters require a query string. So for the drop-off, which is the airport, I need to pass the airport's name. For example, if the flight's fromId is for O'Hare, then the query would be "O'Hare International Airport". But how do I get that name from the fromId obtained via Search_Flight_Location? The Search_Flight_Location response might include the airport's name. Let me check the function descriptions.

The Search_Flight_Location function's description says it finds airports by their location, address, state, country, etc., and returns the id. So the id is the airport's code (like ORD), and the name might be part of the response. But the user's initial query for the flight location would return the airport's ID (e.g., ORD) for Chicago. So when the user searches for "Chicago", the Search_Flight_Location returns entries for ORD, MDW, etc. So the taxi drop-off would need to be the specific airport's name. Therefore, after getting the flight's fromId (say, ORD), the taxi drop-off query would be "O'Hare International Airport, Chicago".

But since the user hasn't specified which airport, the flight search might return multiple options, but the earliest flight might be from ORD. However, the taxi function needs the exact place ID for the airport. So perhaps the Taxi_Search_Location for the airport would need to be called with the airport's full name.

So steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get the airport IDs (ORD, MDW, etc.). Then, similarly for Miami, but the user wants to fly to Miami, so the toId would be MIA or FLL.

Wait, but the user's flight is from Chicago to Miami, so fromId is Chicago's airport, toId is Miami's. So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Chicago" to get possible airports, then for "Miami" to get possible airports.

But the user might not care which airport in Chicago as long as it's the earliest flight. So the flight search would return all options, sorted by earliest departure time.

But the taxi needs to take them to the same airport as the flight's departure. So after getting the flight's fromId (e.g., ORD), then get the corresponding Google Place ID for ORD via Taxi_Search_Location.

But how to map the flight's fromId (like ORD) to the Taxi_Search_Location's query? For example, ORD's full name is O'Hare International Airport. So the query would be "O'Hare International Airport".

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Chicago" to get the airport codes and their names. Then, after selecting the flight's fromId (e.g., ORD), use the corresponding name to get the googlePlaceId via Taxi_Search_Location.

But since the user hasn't specified which airport, maybe the first result in the flight location search is the main one, so proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the Taxi_Search_Location can take the airport code as part of the query. For example, "ORD Chicago" or similar.

But according to the function definitions, Taxi_Search_Location's query parameter is a string like location names, cities, etc. So for the airport, it's better to use the full name.

So step by step:

First, get the flight's fromId and toId.

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get possible departure airports. Let's say the response includes "id": "ORD" for O'Hare.

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" to get possible arrival airports, which would be "id": "MIA" for Miami International.

Then, use these IDs in Search_Flights to find the earliest flight after 1 PM on Nov 20, 2024.

Once the flight is found, the departure airport is known (e.g., ORD), so then call Taxi_Search_Location with query "O'Hare International Airport" to get the googlePlaceId for the airport.

Similarly, the pick-up location is the United Center in Chicago, so call Taxi_Search_Location with query "United Center, Chicago" to get its googlePlaceId.

Then, use Search_Taxi with the pick-up and drop-off place IDs, pick-up time after the meeting (1 PM), so pick_up_time is "13:00" and pick_up_date "2024-11-20".

Next, after arriving in Miami, find a hotel within 40 km of the airport (MIA). So first, get the coordinates of Miami Airport. To do that, use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Miami International Airport" to get its latitude and longitude. Alternatively, use the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates function, which requires latitude and longitude. But how to get those? The Search_Hotel_Destination function returns latitude and longitude. So call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Miami International Airport" to get the coordinates of Miami Airport. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 40 km (but the function's radius is in km, and the user wants within 40 km, which is within the allowed range of 10-500). The arrival_date would be the date they arrive in Miami, which is November 20, 2024 (assuming the flight arrives the same day, but depending on flight duration, maybe it's the same day). Departure_date would be when they leave, but the user hasn't specified, so maybe default to a day after, but since the user hasn't specified, perhaps use a placeholder. However, the function requires arrival and departure dates. Since the user is looking for a hotel to stay during their vacation, but the exact dates aren't given, but they are flying on Nov 20, so maybe assume arrival on Nov 20 and departure on Nov 21. But the user might need to specify, but
