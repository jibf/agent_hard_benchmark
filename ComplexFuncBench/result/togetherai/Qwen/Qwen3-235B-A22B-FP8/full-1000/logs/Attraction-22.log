2025-08-13 21:23:54,902 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-22 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Etihad Stadium after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location function with the query "Etihad Stadium" to find relevant attractions. The response listed several stadiums, including the Etihad in Manchester. I then called Get_Attraction_Details with the specific slug from the search results.

The detailed response provided a description of the guided tour, highlighting access to the players' tunnel, pitch, press room, dressing rooms, and other facilities. It also included practical info like price, cancellation policy, and accessibility. Now, I need to present this information in a clear, user-friendly way. I'll structure the answer to cover key points such as the tour experience, highlights, practical details, and a summary of the reviews. Making sure to mention the 75-minute duration, the guided aspect, and the notable features like the holographic content and cinema suite. Also, include the price, cancellation policy, and the 5-star review to give a comprehensive overview.
