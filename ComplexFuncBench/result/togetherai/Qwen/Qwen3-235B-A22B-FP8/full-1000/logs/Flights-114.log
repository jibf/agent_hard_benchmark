Okay, let's break down the user's request. They need to find the cheapest multi-stop flight from Wuhan to Philadelphia with a layover in Kuala Lumpur around November 10, 2024. Also, they don't want overnight layovers, and they need the seat map for the flight.

First, I need to figure out which functions to use. The user mentioned looking for the cheapest multi-stop flight, so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function seems appropriate. This function returns the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. The parameters required are legs (fromId, toId, date) and optionally cabinClass. Since the user didn't specify a cabin class, maybe default to economy.

But wait, the user also wants to get the seat map for the flight. To get the seat map, I need the offerToken from the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function. So maybe first, I need to use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flight, but then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken for the seat map. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return the offerToken, so perhaps I need to first get the minimum price, then perform a search with Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the specific flight details including offerToken.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days, but does it include the flight details needed for the seat map? Probably not. So the steps would be:

1. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the minimum price and possible dates, ensuring the layover isn't overnight. But how to check for overnight layovers? The function might not handle that, so maybe after getting possible flights, check the departure and arrival times to ensure the layover isn't overnight. However, since the user specified no overnight layovers, maybe the search function should include that constraint. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not allow filtering by layover duration. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe first use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the specific dates and the 'no overnight layover' constraint (which might require checking the flight times). But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops function's parameters don't include a filter for layover duration. So the user might need to manually check the flight times to ensure the layover isn't overnight. But since the user is asking for automation, perhaps the assistant needs to handle that.

Wait, the functions available don't have a parameter to specify layover time constraints. So the assistant might have to proceed with the available functions and then filter the results based on the layover duration. However, since the assistant can't process the actual flight data (as it's an API call), maybe the user needs to be informed that the function doesn't support filtering by layover duration, but the assistant can proceed with the search and then the user can check the layover times. But the user's instruction says she doesn't accept flights with overnight layovers, so the assistant must ensure that the flights returned meet this condition. But how?

This might be a limitation of the available functions. Since the functions don't have a parameter to specify layover duration, the assistant might have to proceed with the search and then filter the results based on the layover time. However, the assistant can't process the actual flight data until the API returns it. Therefore, the assistant might need to first get the cheapest flights using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get detailed flight info, including departure and arrival times for each leg, then filter out those with overnight layovers, and then get the seat map for the acceptable flight.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flights around November 10, 2024, with the given route (Wuhan -> Kuala Lumpur -> Philadelphia). This will give the minimum price and possible dates.

But wait, the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight. So the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function's response should include the dates and prices. Then, the assistant can pick the date with the lowest price.

But to get the seat map, the assistant needs the offerToken from Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Therefore, after identifying the best date from the minimum price function, the assistant would need to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with that date to get the offerToken, then use that to get the seat map.

However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return the offerToken, so the assistant has to perform a separate search with the same parameters but using Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken.

But first, the assistant needs to get the location IDs for Wuhan, Kuala Lumpur, and Philadelphia using Search_Flight_Location.

So the detailed steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the fromId for Wuhan (e.g., WUH.AIRPORT), toId for Philadelphia (PHL.AIRPORT), and the layover in Kuala Lumpur (KUL.AIRPORT).

2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs: [Wuhan to Kuala Lumpur on Nov 10, then Kuala Lumpur to Philadelphia on the same day or next day? Wait, the user wants a layover in Kuala Lumpur. So the legs would be:

Leg 1: fromId: Wuhan (WUH.AIRPORT), toId: Kuala Lumpur (KUL.AIRPORT), date: 2024-11-10

Leg 2: fromId: Kuala Lumpur (KUL.AIRPORT), toId: Philadelphia (PHL.AIRPORT), date: ?

But the user says "around November 10, 2024". The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function will check 5 days before and after, so the date can be Nov 10, and the API will check from Nov 5 to Nov 15.

But the legs need to have dates. However, for a multi-stop flight, the second leg's date depends on the layover duration. If the layover is same-day, then both legs are on Nov 10. If it's overnight, the second leg would be Nov 11. But the user doesn't accept overnight layovers, so the second leg must be on the same day as the first leg's departure. Therefore, the second leg's date should be the same as the first leg's date.

Wait, but how does the API handle this? The legs array requires each leg's date. So for a multi-stop flight with a layover in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 10, the first leg is Wuhan to KL on Nov 10, the second leg is KL to Philadelphia on Nov 10 (same day). If the layover is overnight, the second leg would be Nov 11, which the user doesn't want. Therefore, in the legs array, the dates for both legs should be Nov 10.

But how does the API handle this? The user wants to ensure that the layover is not overnight, so the flight must depart KL on the same day as arrival from Wuhan. Therefore, the legs should have the same date.

So the legs array would be:

[
  {
    "fromId": "WUH.AIRPORT",
    "toId": "KUL.AIRPORT",
    "date": "2024-11-10"
  },
  {
    "fromId": "KUL.AIRPORT",
    "toId": "PHL.AIRPORT",
    "date": "2024-11-10"
  }
]

But the API might handle this by looking for flights where the layover is on the same day. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops function might return the minimum price for such a configuration.

So first, the assistant needs to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Then, call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array as above, cabinClass as ECONOMY (if not specified), and the date as Nov 10. The API will check 5 days before and after, but the user wants around Nov 10, so that's acceptable.

Once the minimum price is found, the assistant needs to get the seat map. For that, the offerToken is required, which comes from Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. So the assistant would need to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs, sorted by CHEAPEST, and then take the first result's offerToken to call Get_Seat_Map.

But the user also mentioned not accepting overnight layovers. The assistant must ensure that the flights returned by the search do not have overnight layovers. However, the API parameters don't include a way to filter layover duration. Therefore, after getting the flight results, the assistant would need to check the departure and arrival times of each leg to ensure that the layover is within the same day. If the first leg arrives in KL on Nov 10 and the second leg departs KL on Nov 10, that's acceptable. If the second leg is on Nov 11, it's an overnight layover and should be excluded.

But since the assistant can't process the actual flight data until the API returns it, the assistant would have to make the search and then filter the results based on the layover duration. However, in the initial steps, the assistant can structure the legs with the same date to indicate same-day layover.

So putting it all together:

1. Use Search
