Okay, let's see. The user wants to find a beer-themed attraction in Munich that costs under $30. They mentioned the Beer series, so probably looking for tours or tastings.

First, I called the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Beer Munich" as the query. Got back five options. The first one was "Beer and Brewery Tour in Munich" with a price of $46.56, which is over $30. So I need to check the next ones.

Next, I used Get_Attraction_Details on the second product, "Beer Tour with Tasting in Munich". The price here is $27.07, which is under $30. That fits the user's budget. The description includes a tasting of three beers, snacks, museum admission, and a guide. Looks good. No negative reviews mentioned, and it's operated by Todo Tours. 

Since this one is under $30, I don't need to check the others. The user should go with this option. I'll present the details clearly, highlighting the price and inclusions.

- **Includes**:
