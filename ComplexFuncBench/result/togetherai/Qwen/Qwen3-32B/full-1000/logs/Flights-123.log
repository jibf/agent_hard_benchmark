Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel to San Diego and Phoenix, spend 7 days each, then return to Dallas. They haven't decided the order and need the cheapest flight around December 1st, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. Since the order isn't decided, there are two possible routes: San Diego first then Phoenix, or Phoenix first then San Diego. Each route would have three legs: departure, stop, and return. But since they stay 7 days in each, the return leg would be from the second city back to Dallas. Wait, actually, the user's plan is to go to both cities, stay 7 days each, then return. So the trip would be Dallas to City A (either SD or PHX), then City A to City B, then City B back to Dallas. So two possible itineraries.

But the user wants the cheapest flight. To find that, I need to check both possible routes. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can help here. It requires legs with fromId, toId, and date. The dates need to be around December 1st. Let's assume they want to depart around Dec 1st, spend 7 days in the first city, then 7 days in the second, returning from the second city about 14 days later. Wait, if they leave Dallas on Dec 1st, go to City A, stay 7 days, then go to City B, stay 7 days, return to Dallas. So the departure dates would be Dec 1st (Dallas to A), Dec 8th (A to B), and Dec 15th (B to Dallas). But the user hasn't specified the return date, but since they want the cheapest around Dec 1st, maybe the API's ±5 days window can help. However, the API for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. But the user's trip spans multiple dates. Hmm, maybe the API can be used for each possible route, adjusting the dates accordingly.

Wait, the user wants the departure date of the cheapest flight around Dec 1st. So the initial departure from Dallas to the first city (SD or PHX) should be around Dec 1st. The API can find the minimum price for multi-stop flights, so I need to create two scenarios: one where the first leg is Dallas to SD, then SD to PHX, then PHX to Dallas. The other scenario is Dallas to PHX, then PHX to SD, then SD to Dallas. For each scenario, I need to set the legs with dates. Let's assume the user wants to leave Dallas on Dec 1st, so for the first scenario: Dallas to SD on Dec 1st, SD to PHX on Dec 8th (after 7 days), PHX to Dallas on Dec 15th (after another 7 days). For the second scenario: Dallas to PHX on Dec 1st, PHX to SD on Dec 8th, SD to Dallas on Dec 15th. The API can be called for each of these two itineraries, and then compare which one is cheaper.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API might not handle the entire multi-city trip in one call. Wait, the API's legs array can have multiple legs. For example, for the first scenario, the legs would be:

[
  {fromId: Dallas, toId: SD, date: 2024-12-01},
  {fromId: SD, toId: PHX, date: 2024-12-08},
  {fromId: PHX, toId: Dallas, date: 2024-12-15}
]

But the API's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, the query date is for each leg? Or the first leg? The description says "within 5 days before and after the query date", but the parameters don't have a query date. Wait, looking back at the API parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, the legs have dates. The API's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, maybe the query date is the first leg's date? Or perhaps the API allows flexibility in the dates of the legs, adjusting within 5 days of the specified dates. The example given in the legs shows a date, but the description says the API returns flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Maybe the API is designed to find the minimum price for multi-stop flights where each leg's date can vary by ±5 days from the specified date. So if the user specifies a date for each leg, the API will look for flights that depart within 5 days before or after each leg's date. But the user wants the departure date around Dec 1st, so maybe the first leg's date is fixed, and the subsequent legs are adjusted accordingly. However, the user hasn't specified the exact dates for the second and third legs, just that they want to stay 7 days in each place. So the dates for the second and third legs would be 7 days after the first and second legs, respectively. But the API might not account for that. Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with the API finding the cheapest multi-stop flights with the legs as specified, even if the dates are adjusted within the 5-day window. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to first get the location IDs for San Diego, Phoenix, and Dallas using the Search_Flight_Location API. Then, construct the legs for both possible itineraries (SD first or PHX first) with the initial departure date around Dec 1st, and use the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API to find the cheapest option. Once the minimum price is found, use the Get_Flight_Details API to retrieve the detailed information for that flight.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the IDs for Dallas, San Diego, and Phoenix.
2. For each possible itinerary (SD first or PHX first), create the legs with the initial date around Dec 1st, then the subsequent dates 7 days later.
3. Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each itinerary to find the cheapest option.
4. Compare the two itineraries and select the cheaper one.
5. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the cheapest option to get detailed info.

But the user hasn't specified the number of passengers. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API doesn't have parameters for adults or children, but the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops does. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops parameters don't include adults or children, only legs and cabinClass. The user didn't mention the number of passengers, so maybe we can assume 1 adult as default. The cabin class is also not specified, so we can default to ECONOMY.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Dallas, San Diego, and Phoenix to get their IDs. Let's assume the user is departing from Dallas (DFW or DAL?), but the exact airport might not matter for the location ID. The Search_Flight_Location API takes a query, so for Dallas, query "Dallas", San Diego "San Diego", Phoenix "Phoenix".

Once we have the IDs, construct the legs for both itineraries. For example, if Dallas's ID is DFW.AIRPORT, San Diego's is SAN.AIRPORT, Phoenix's is PHX.AIRPORT.

First itinerary legs:
[
  {fromId: DFW.AIRPORT, toId: SAN.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-01},
  {fromId: SAN.AIRPORT, toId: PHX.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-08},
  {fromId: PHX.AIRPORT, toId: DFW.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-15}
]

Second itinerary legs:
[
  {fromId: DFW.AIRPORT, toId: PHX.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-01},
  {fromId: PHX.AIRPORT, toId: SAN.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-08},
  {fromId: SAN.AIRPORT, toId: DFW.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-15}
]

Then call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each set of legs. The API will return the minimum price within 5 days before and after each leg's date. So the departure date might adjust to, say, Nov 28th for the first leg, and the subsequent legs would adjust accordingly. But the user wants the departure date around Dec 1st, so the API's ±5 days window should cover that.

Once the minimum prices are found for both itineraries, compare them and choose the cheaper one. Then, use the Get_Flight_Details API with the token from the cheapest option to get the detailed flight information, including baggage, meals, etc.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API doesn't return a token; it returns the minimum price. Wait, the Get_Flight_Details requires a token from Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. So perhaps after finding the minimum price via Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, we need to use the Search_F
