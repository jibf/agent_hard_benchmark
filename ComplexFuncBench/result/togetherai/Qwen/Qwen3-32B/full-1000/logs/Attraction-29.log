2025-08-14 20:41:02,786 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-29 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me break down the information the user asked for. They wanted details about Times Square after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Times Square" as the query. That gave me the product slug needed for the next step.

Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the first response. The data shows it's a photoshoot service in Times Square. The description mentions professional photography, which the user might find interesting. The price is $107.49, and there's a free cancellation policy. Also, it's wheelchair accessible and suitable for all ages, which are important details for accessibility and planning.

I should present this info clearly, highlighting the key points like what's included, the price, cancellation policy, and accessibility. Making sure to mention the operator, Picster, adds credibility. The user might be considering booking, so including practical details like bringing a ticket and the age requirement is helpful. I'll structure it in a friendly, easy-to-read format without any markdown.
