The most impressive, ambitious, comprehensive yet also destructive and culturally catastrophic urban planning move, possibly of all time - the Haussmannian reconstruction - is the main topic of this tour. We present the pivotal change in the history of the city, where a medieval town, with aspects of renaissance and classical architecture scattered about, became a modern, industrialized capital of the world - in the time span of only 17 years. This is, without a doubt, one of the most interesting tours we offer, as it delves into the very birth of modernity: industrial life, consumerist culture, modern politics, urban living. This tour, like no other, shows us the birth of the world we today live in, and how it came to be in the most important (also, the most beautiful) city in the world, Paris.",

Okay, let's see. The user is looking for Napoleon-themed attractions in Paris for their child, and they want something under $100. The first attraction we checked was the Napoleon III's Paris city tour, which costs $324.84. That's way over $100, so we moved on. The next one was the Mille Feuille Napol√©on Pastry Class, which is $86.62. That's under $100, so that's a good option.

Now, I need to check if there are more options, but the user only asked to keep checking until we find one under $100. Since we found the pastry class under $100, maybe we can stop here. But let me confirm if the user wants more options or just the first one under $100. The user said "keep checking the next ones until you find something under 100," so once we found the pastry class, we can present it as the suitable option. 

I should also check if there are other attractions listed. The search results had five products. The third one is Napoleon's Guided Tour for Kids & Families, but we haven't checked its price yet. However, since the user's main request is to find something under $100, and we already found the pastry class which is under, maybe we can present that as the answer. But to be thorough, maybe check the next one's price as well. Wait, the user's instruction was to check until the first one under $100 is found. So once we found the second one under, we can stop. 

So the answer should be the Mille Feuille Pastry Class at $86.62. I should present that as the recommended option. Also, note that it's a pastry class, which might be engaging for a child, especially if they're a fan of Napoleon. The description mentions it's a hands-on class, which could be fun. Also, check if there are any age restrictions. The additional info says you need to be 18 or older to book, but it allows being accompanied by an adult. Since the user's child is a fan, maybe the child can participate with an adult. 

So the final answer should highlight this option, its price, and maybe the key details like what's included and any important info from the response.

**Mille Feuille Napol√©on Pastry Class in Paris**  
- **Price**: $86.62 (USD)  
- **Description**: A hands-on pastry class where participants can learn to make the iconic mille-feuille, a dessert linked to Napoleon's legacy.  
- **Includes**: Coffee/tea, access to the class, and instruction from experts.  
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair accessible, allows service animals, and public transport options nearby.
