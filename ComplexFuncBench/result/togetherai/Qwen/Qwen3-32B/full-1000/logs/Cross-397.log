2025-08-14 19:31:32,213 - evaluation_logger_Cross-397 - INFO - Query: It's 9:30 in the morning on November 8, 2024. I just had breakfast at the Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain. All local flights in Montreal have been canceled due to heavy rain. I need to catch a taxi to an airport in a nearby city to fly to Vancouver right away. Could you find a taxi for me and check the corresponding flight information?

Okay, let's tackle this user's problem step by step. First, the user is in Montreal and needs a taxi to a nearby airport due to local flight cancellations. They want to fly to Vancouver. 

So, the first thing I need to do is find the pick-up location's googlePlaceId for the taxi. The user mentioned they had breakfast at the Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain. I should use the Taxi_Search_Location tool with the query as that hotel's name to get the pick-up place ID.

Next, the user needs to get to a nearby airport. Since Montreal's flights are canceled, they need an airport in a nearby city. I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find airports nearby. The query here would be something like "nearby airports from Montreal" or maybe just "Montreal" to get the main airport, but since local flights are canceled, maybe a different approach. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool is for finding airports by location. So using "Montreal" as the query might return Montreal-Trudeau International Airport, but since flights there are canceled, maybe the tool can find other nearby airports. However, the user needs to go to a different city's airport. Maybe the tool can return other airports in nearby cities. Let me check the parameters: the query can be a location, so perhaps "nearby airports" or "airports near Montreal". But the tool's description says it's for finding airports by their location, address, state, country, etc. So using "Montreal" as the query should return Montreal's airports, but since they're canceled, maybe the user needs an alternative. Wait, the user is looking for an airport in a nearby city. So perhaps I need to find a list of nearby cities first. But the user hasn't specified which city. Maybe the taxi drop-off location is another city's airport. Hmm, this might require multiple steps.

Wait, the user needs to catch a taxi to an airport in a nearby city. So first, find the taxi from the hotel to that airport. To do that, I need the drop-off location's googlePlaceId. So I need to find the airport in the nearby city. Let's say the nearby city is Ottawa, for example. But how do I know which city? The user hasn't specified, so maybe I need to find the nearest airports first. Let me think. The user's main goal is to get to Vancouver. So after getting the taxi to a nearby airport, they need to book a flight from that airport to Vancouver. 

So first, find the taxi from the hotel to the nearest available airport. To do that, I need the drop-off airport's googlePlaceId. But how to find that airport? Maybe the user is looking for the nearest airport that's not in Montreal. So perhaps using the Search_Flight_Location tool with "nearby airports" or "airports near Montreal" to get a list of nearby airports. Once I have that, I can select the closest one with available flights. But the user hasn't specified which one, so maybe the assistant should first find the nearby airports, then proceed. However, the user's immediate request is to find a taxi and check flight info. So maybe the assistant should first get the taxi information, which requires the drop-off location (the nearby airport's place ID), and then check flights from that airport to Vancouver.

But to get the taxi, I need the drop-off place ID. So first, I need to find the airport in the nearby city. Let's assume the user wants the nearest airport. Let's use the Search_Flight_Location tool with query "Montreal" to get possible airports. But since Montreal's are canceled, maybe the next step is to find another airport. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a different city's airport. For example, Ottawa's airport. But how to determine that? The user hasn't specified, so perhaps the assistant should first find the nearby airports using the Search_Flight_Location tool with a query like "nearby airports from Montreal" or "airports near Montreal". Let's proceed with that.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Montreal" to get a list of airports. Then, from that list, pick the one that's not in Montreal (if any) and has available flights. Once that airport is identified, get its place ID via Taxi_Search_Location, then proceed to find the taxi. But wait, the Search_Flight_Location returns the airport's id, not the googlePlaceId. The taxi tool requires the googlePlaceId. So perhaps after getting the airport's id from Search_Flight_Location, we need to get its address or location details to then use in Taxi_Search_Location to get the place ID. Alternatively, maybe the airport's name can be used directly in Taxi_Search_Location. For example, if the airport is Ottawa International Airport, then using that name in Taxi_Search_Location would get the place ID.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Taxi_Search_Location with the hotel name (Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain) to get the pick-up place ID.

2. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "nearby airports" or "Montreal" to find nearby airports. From the results, select an airport in a different city (since Montreal's are canceled). Let's say the result includes Ottawa International Airport.

3. Use Taxi_Search_Location with the airport name (Ottawa International Airport) to get the drop-off place ID.

4. Use Search_Taxi with the pick-up and drop-off place IDs, along with the current time and date (November 8, 2024, 9:30 AM) to find a taxi.

5. Then, use Search_Flights with the fromId (Ottawa airport's id from step 2) and toId (Vancouver's airport id, which would require another Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver) to find available flights.

But the user's current request is to find a taxi and check the corresponding flight info. So the assistant needs to first handle the taxi part, then the flight part.

However, the user hasn't specified the destination airport in the nearby city, so the assistant might need to make an assumption or find the nearest available airport. Since the user is in Montreal and local flights are canceled, the nearest alternative might be Ottawa, but that's an assumption. The assistant should probably first find the nearby airports using the Search_Flight_Location tool with a query for Montreal, then proceed.

But given the tools available, let's outline the steps:

First, get the pick-up place ID for the hotel:

Call Taxi_Search_Location with query "Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain".

Then, find the nearby airports. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Montreal" to get a list of airports. From the results, select an airport that's not in Montreal (assuming the API returns nearby ones). For example, if the API returns Montreal-Trudeau and Ottawa, but Montreal is canceled, then Ottawa is the next option. Then, get the airport's id from the Search_Flight_Location response.

But to get the drop-off place ID for the taxi, we need the airport's name or address. So after getting the airport's id, we might need to get its location details. However, the Search_Flight_Location tool returns the airport's id, but not the address. So perhaps we need to use the Location_to_Lat_Long tool to get the coordinates of the airport, then use Get_Nearby_Cities to find the city, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, use the airport's name in the Taxi_Search_Location tool to get the place ID.

So, for example, if the airport is Ottawa International Airport, then call Taxi_Search_Location with query "Ottawa International Airport" to get the drop-off place ID.

Once we have both place IDs, then call Search_Taxi with the pick-up and drop-off place IDs, along with the current date and time (November 8, 2024, 9:30 AM).

Then, for the flight info, use the fromId from the Search_Flight_Location (Ottawa's airport id) and toId from a Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver (e.g., Vancouver International Airport) to get the flight details.

But the user hasn't specified the destination airport in Vancouver, so we need to search for that as well. So another Search_Flight_Location with query "Vancouver" to get the toId.

Putting it all together, the assistant needs to make several tool calls:

1. Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Montreal to find nearby airports.
3. Taxi_Search_Location for the selected nearby airport.
4. Search_Taxi with the place IDs and current time/date.
5. Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver to get the toId.
6. Search_Flights with fromId (nearby airport) and toId (Vancouver) with the departDate as the same day or next available.

However, the user's current time is 9:30 AM on November 8, 2024. The taxi would need to be booked for that date and time, and the flight would need to depart as soon as possible after arriving at the nearby airport.

But given the tools, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. The user's initial request is to find a taxi and check flight info. So the first step is to find the taxi, which requires the pick-up and drop-off place IDs. The assistant needs to first get the pick-up place ID (hotel) and then the drop-off place ID (nearby airport). But to get the drop-off place ID, the assistant needs to know which airport, which requires searching for nearby airports first.

So the first tool call should be Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel. Then, the next step would be to search for
