Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They need help finding the best economy class flights for a trip from London to Paris and Berlin, with a return to London on December 15th. They want detailed flight info and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The trip has three parts: London to Paris, Paris to Berlin, and Berlin back to London. Each leg requires a flight. Since they're staying a week in each city, the return date is December 15th, so the outbound flights are on December 1st and the return is on the 15th. Wait, but Paris to Berlin is a domestic flight, so maybe they need a flight from Paris to Berlin on December 1st, then Berlin to London on December 8th, and then London to Paris again? Wait, no, the user said they'll stay in each city for a week. So maybe the itinerary is London to Paris on Dec 1, stay a week, then Paris to Berlin on Dec 8, stay another week, then Berlin back to London on Dec 15. But the user's message says they return to London on Dec 15, so maybe the return is Berlin to London. But how do they get from London to Paris and then Paris to Berlin? So the outbound legs are London (LHR/LON) to Paris (CDG/ORY) on Dec 1, then Paris to Berlin (TXL/BER) on Dec 8, and return Berlin to London on Dec 15. 

To use the API, I need to search for multi-stop flights. The user mentioned "best" economy class, so the sort parameter should be "BEST". The legs array should include each segment. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops endpoint requires legs as an array of fromId, toId, and date. So first, I need to get the location IDs for each airport. The user didn't specify the exact airports, so I might need to use the Search_Flight_Location endpoint to find the IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin airports. 

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact airports, so maybe the API can handle city codes. For example, LON for London, PAR for Paris, and BER for Berlin. But the Search_Flight_Location endpoint requires a query. Let me check: the Search_Flight_Location parameters take a query string, which can be the city name. So for London, query "London" would return the location ID, which might be something like "LON.CITY". Similarly for Paris and Berlin. 

So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. Let's start with London. Then Paris, then Berlin. Once I have the IDs, I can construct the legs array. 

But the user's request is to find the best economy flights. So the first step is to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops endpoint with the legs as London to Paris on Dec 1, Paris to Berlin on Dec 8, and Berlin to London on Dec 15. Wait, but the user is returning on Dec 15, so the return leg is Berlin to London. But the legs array for multi-stop flights can have multiple legs, but how does the API handle round trips? The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops is for one-way multi-stop flights. Wait, the user's journey is a round trip with two stops. Maybe the legs array would have three legs: London to Paris, Paris to Berlin, and Berlin to London. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops might not handle return trips. Wait, the description says "Search multi-stop Flights", which might be for one-way trips with multiple stops. For a round trip, perhaps the user needs to search for two separate flights: outbound and return. But the user's case is a multi-city trip: London to Paris, Paris to Berlin, Berlin to London. So the legs array would have three entries. 

So the legs would be:
1. fromId: London's location ID, toId: Paris's location ID, date: 2024-12-01
2. fromId: Paris's location ID, toId: Berlin's location ID, date: 2024-12-08
3. fromId: Berlin's location ID, toId: London's location ID, date: 2024-12-15

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops might not allow three legs in a single request. Wait, the example given in the parameters for legs is an array of objects. The example shows a single leg, but the description says "If there are multiple stops, there should be more leg objects in the array." So it's possible to have multiple legs. So the user's trip can be handled as a multi-stop flight with three legs. 

So first, I need to get the location IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin. Let's start by calling Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

First, for London: query "London". The response would give the location ID, perhaps "LON.CITY". Similarly for Paris: query "Paris" gives "PAR.CITY", and Berlin: "BER.CITY". 

Once I have those IDs, I can construct the legs array. Then, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with adults=1 (assuming default), legs array with the three legs, cabinClass=ECONOMY, sort=BEST. 

After getting the flight options, the user wants detailed flight information and seat maps. For each flight, I need to use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search response. Then, for the seat map, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the same flight. 

But the user's request is to help find the best flights and provide detailed info and seat maps. So the steps are:

1. Search for multi-stop flights with the three legs.
2. For each flight option, retrieve flight details.
3. For each flight, retrieve the seat map.

But the user might not have provided the exact number of passengers. The default for adults is 1, but the user is "our company", which could mean multiple people. However, the user didn't specify the number of adults or children, so I'll proceed with the default of 1 adult. 

So the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location for London, Paris, and Berlin to get their IDs. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. 

Wait, but the user's message is a single query. The assistant needs to make multiple tool calls. However, in the initial response, the assistant can only make one tool call. Wait, the user's instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in sequence. 

But in the example, each turn has a single tool call. So perhaps the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for London, then Paris, then Berlin, but in the first step, the assistant can only make one tool call. Wait, no, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. Wait, looking at the example in the problem statement, the user's message is followed by the assistant's thought, then a tool call. So each turn is a single tool call. So the assistant needs to proceed step by step. 

So first, the assistant needs to get the location IDs for London, Paris, and Berlin. Let's start with London. 

First tool call: Search_Flight_Location with query "London". 

Then, the response would give the location ID for London. Then, next step would be to call Search_Flight_Location for Paris, then Berlin. But since the user's query requires multiple steps, the assistant would need to make multiple tool calls in sequence. However, in the initial response, the assistant can only make one tool call. So the first step is to get the location ID for London. 

But the user's question is complex and requires multiple steps. The assistant's first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for London. Then, in the next turn, the user (or the system) would provide the response, and the assistant would proceed to the next step. 

But in this scenario, the assistant is to generate the first tool call. So the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location for London. 

But the user's question is about finding flights, so the assistant needs to first get the location IDs for all three cities. So the first three tool calls would be Search_Flight_Location for London, Paris, and Berlin. 

But the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. So the first tool call is for London. Then, the next step would be for Paris, then Berlin. 

However, the user's message is a single query, and the assistant is to generate the first tool call. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for London. 

But the user's message is in the initial prompt, and the assistant is to generate the first tool call. So the correct first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for London. 

So the first tool call is:

{
  "name": "Search_Flight_Location",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "London"
  }
}

Then, once the location ID for London is obtained, the next step would be to call Search_Flight_Location for Paris, then Berlin. After that, the assistant can proceed to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the three legs. 

But since the user's question requires multiple steps, the assistant's first response is to get the location ID for London. 

Therefore, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "London".
