2025-08-14 20:41:26,451 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-27 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me process the information the user asked for. They wanted details about the Taj Mahal after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Taj Mahal" as the query. That gave me the product slug needed for the next step. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug to get the full info.

Looking at the response, there's a lot of data. The description mentions a day trip including the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort. The user might be planning a visit, so I should highlight key points like the itinerary, what's included, and important notes. The cancellation policy is free, which is good to mention. Also, the price is around $9.71, but I should check if that's accurate since sometimes there might be more to the cost. The additional info includes accessibility and age requirements, so travelers with specific needs should know that. I need to present this in a clear, friendly way without overwhelming them. Maybe summarize the main attractions, what to expect, and practical details like booking and cancellation. Make sure to mention the operator and any tips from the description. Avoid jargon and keep it conversational.
