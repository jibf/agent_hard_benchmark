Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel to Boston and Washington, spending 6 days each, then return to Chicago. They haven't decided the order and need the cheapest flight around December 10th, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the flight paths. Since they're going to both cities, it's a multi-stop trip. The user might be considering two possible routes: Boston first then Washington, or vice versa. To find the cheapest option, I should check both routes.

The user mentioned December 10th as the departure date. But since they want the cheapest, maybe looking at dates around that time (like 5 days before or after) could help. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool is designed for this, as it finds the minimum price within a 5-day window. That's perfect.

Next, I need the location IDs for the airports. The user mentioned Boston, Washington, and Chicago. I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool for each city to get their airport IDs. For example, Boston's main airport is BOS, Washington is likely IAD or DCA, and Chicago is ORD or MDW. But I need to confirm the exact IDs via the API.

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs for each possible route. Let's say the first route is Chicago to Boston, then Boston to Washington, then Washington back to Chicago. The second route would reverse the order. Each leg needs a fromId, toId, and date. The dates would be December 10th, 2024, plus 6 days for each stay. So departure from Chicago to Boston on Dec 10, arrive Boston, stay 6 days, then fly to Washington on Dec 16, stay 6 days, return to Chicago on Jan 5th. The return date would be 6 days after arriving in Washington. Wait, but the user wants to return to Chicago after both stops. So the return flight would be from Washington to Chicago, departing on Jan 5th. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool might handle the dates automatically when looking for the cheapest option around the specified date.

However, the user hasn't specified the exact return date, just the departure date around Dec 10th. The tool's description says it returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. But since the user is planning a multi-stop trip with two cities, each with a 6-day stay, the dates for each leg are sequential. So the first leg is Dec 10, the second leg would be Dec 16 (after 6 days in Boston), then the third leg would be Jan 1 (after 6 days in Washington). But the user might not have decided the order, so I need to check both possible itineraries.

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool requires the legs array. For each possible route (Boston first or Washington first), I need to create two legs: Chicago to first city, first city to second city, then second city back to Chicago. But the user's return is to Chicago after both stops, so the third leg is from Washington to Chicago. However, the user might not have specified the return date, but since they stay 6 days in each, the return would be 12 days after departure. But the tool's example shows legs as an array, so maybe the user needs to input all legs. However, the user hasn't decided the order, so perhaps I need to check both possible orders.

But the user is asking for the cheapest flight around December 10th. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can take the legs with dates, but since the user is flexible on the order, maybe I need to run two separate searches: one for Boston first and one for Washington first, then compare the results.

Alternatively, maybe the tool can handle it if I input both possible routes. But the tool's parameters require the legs array. So perhaps I need to first get the location IDs for Boston, Washington, and Chicago airports.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Boston to get fromId (e.g., BOS.AIRPORT).
2. Use Search_Flight_Location for Washington to get toId (e.g., IAD.AIRPORT).
3. Use Search_Flight_Location for Chicago to get fromId (e.g., ORD.AIRPORT).

Once I have these IDs, I can create two possible legs arrays:

Option 1: Chicago -> Boston -> Washington -> Chicago
Legs:
- fromId: ORD.AIRPORT, toId: BOS.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-10
- fromId: BOS.AIRPORT, toId: IAD.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-16 (6 days later)
- fromId: IAD.AIRPORT, toId: ORD.AIRPORT, date: 2024-01-05 (6 days after arrival in Washington)

Option 2: Chicago -> Washington -> Boston -> Chicago
Legs:
- fromId: ORD.AIRPORT, toId: IAD.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-10
- fromId: IAD.AIRPORT, toId: BOS.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-16
- fromId: BOS.AIRPORT, toId: ORD.AIRPORT, date: 2024-01-05

But the user wants the cheapest flight around December 10th. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can find the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. However, the legs need to be specified. Since the user is flexible on the order, maybe I need to check both options and see which is cheaper.

But the tool's parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops require the legs array. So I need to call the tool twice, once for each possible route, and compare the results.

However, the user hasn't specified the exact return date, but since they stay 6 days in each city, the return would be 12 days after departure. But the tool's example shows that the legs can be specified with dates. However, the user wants the departure date around Dec 10th, so the first leg's date is Dec 10, and the subsequent legs are based on 6-day stays.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool is supposed to find the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, the tool's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. But the query date is for the first leg? Or for each leg? The example in the tool's parameters shows legs with dates, so perhaps the tool adjusts the dates within the 5-day window for each leg. But the user's case requires specific dates based on the 6-day stays. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with the departure date being around Dec 10th, but the exact dates can vary by 5 days. So the first leg's date could be between Dec 5 and Dec 15, and the subsequent legs would adjust accordingly. But the user wants to stay 6 days in each place, so the second leg would be 6 days after the first leg's arrival, and the third leg 6 days after the second. But the tool's Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not account for the stay duration, only the flight dates. So perhaps the user's requirement of 6 days in each city isn't directly part of the flight search, but the flight dates are determined by the stays. Therefore, the legs' dates would be fixed once the first date is chosen. But the tool allows the first date to vary within 5 days before/after the query date, and the subsequent legs would adjust accordingly. However, the tool's parameters require the legs to be specified with dates. So if the user wants the first flight around Dec 10th, the legs would have the first date as Dec 10, and the subsequent dates as Dec 16 and Jan 1. But the tool's Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not adjust the subsequent dates if the first date changes. Therefore, maybe the user's 6-day stay requirement isn't directly handled by the tool, and the dates are fixed. But the user wants the cheapest flight around Dec 10th, so the first leg's date is flexible within 5 days, and the subsequent legs' dates adjust accordingly. However, the tool's parameters require the legs to be specified with dates. Therefore, perhaps the user's 6-day stay is a separate consideration, and the flight dates are based on that. So the first leg is Dec 10, second leg Dec 16, third leg Jan 1. But the tool's Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can find the minimum price for the first leg within 5 days before/after Dec 10, and the subsequent legs would adjust accordingly. However, the tool's parameters require the legs to be specified with dates. Therefore, perhaps the user's 6-day stay is a fixed part of the itinerary, and the tool is used to find the cheapest first leg date around Dec 10, with the subsequent legs' dates based on that. Therefore, the legs would be:

For Option 1 (Boston first):
Leg1: Chicago to Boston on Dec 10 (flexible within 5 days)
Leg2: Boston to Washington on Dec 16 (6 days later
