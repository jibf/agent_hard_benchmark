Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to find the cheapest multi-stop flight from Shanghai to San Francisco with a layover in Frankfurt, departing around December 5, 2024, and without overnight layovers. Also, they need the seat map for the flight.

First, I need to figure out the location IDs for Shanghai, Frankfurt, and San Francisco. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help here. I'll start by searching for each city to get their respective IDs.

For Shanghai, I'll use the query "Shanghai" in the Search_Flight_Location tool. Similarly, I'll do the same for Frankfurt and San Francisco. Once I have the IDs, I can proceed to find the cheapest multi-stop flights.

Next, using the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool, I'll input the legs: Shanghai to Frankfurt, then Frankfurt to San Francisco. The date is December 5, 2024, but since the tool looks for prices within 5 days before and after, I should check that range. Also, the cabin class isn't specified, so I'll default to ECONOMY. The tool will return the cheapest options, and I need to ensure that the layovers aren't overnight. That means the layover duration should be less than 12 hours. I'll have to filter the results accordingly.

Once the cheapest flight is identified, I'll need the offerToken from the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. Wait, but the user mentioned using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops first. However, the offerToken might come from the search results. Maybe after finding the minimum price, I need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same parameters to get the offerToken for the seat map. Or perhaps the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops provides an offerToken? The description says it returns the lowest priced flights, but it's unclear if it includes the offerToken. The Get_Seat_Map requires an offerToken from either Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. So maybe after getting the minimum price, I need to run a search again to get the offerToken.

Alternatively, maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the necessary offerToken. But the parameters for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops don't include offerToken. Hmm. Let me check the tool descriptions again.

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops endpoint returns the lowest priced flights within a date range. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would return the actual flight details, including offerToken. So perhaps the process is: first, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates and parameters to get the offerToken, then use Get_Seat_Map with that offerToken.

But the user wants the cheapest multi-stop flight's departure dates. So first, find the cheapest dates using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then get the seat map for that flight. However, the seat map requires an offerToken from a search. So the steps would be:

1. Search for location IDs of Shanghai, Frankfurt, San Francisco.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs (Shanghai to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to SF) around Dec 5, 2024, to find the cheapest dates (within 5 days).
3. Once the cheapest dates are determined, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those specific dates and parameters to get the offerToken.
4. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken to retrieve the seat map.

But the user's query is to "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map for the flight." So the first step is to find the cheapest dates, then get the seat map for that flight. However, the seat map requires the offerToken from the search, which depends on the specific flight details. Therefore, the process is sequential.

Now, considering the user's requirement to avoid overnight layovers. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not filter by layover duration, so after getting the cheapest options, I might need to check the layover times manually. But since the tool's description doesn't mention layover duration, perhaps the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would include that info, and I can filter there. However, the user's instruction is to not accept overnight layovers, so the layover should be during the day. Therefore, when using Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, I need to ensure that the layover times are within acceptable hours. But how to specify that? The tool parameters don't include layover time constraints. So maybe after retrieving the flights, we have to filter them based on the layover duration. But since the user wants the cheapest, perhaps the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops already gives the cheapest, and then we check if the layover is acceptable. If not, maybe there's a next cheapest option.

But the user's main goal is to find the cheapest flight without overnight layovers. So the process would be:

- Find the cheapest multi-stop flights (using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops) with the given legs and dates.
- Check if the layover is overnight. If yes, look for the next cheapest option within the date range that meets the layover criteria.
- Once the correct flight is found, retrieve the offerToken and then the seat map.

However, the tools available don't have a parameter to specify layover duration, so this might require manual filtering after retrieving the results. But since the user is asking for the assistant to handle this, I need to structure the tool calls accordingly.

So, the first step is to get the location IDs for the three cities. Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the offerToken. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user's query is to "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map for the flight." So the first tool call is to get the location IDs, then Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, then Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might not have provided all the necessary parameters. For example, the legs require fromId, toId, and date. The date is around Dec 5, 2024, so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will check 5 days before and after. The legs are Shanghai to Frankfurt, then Frankfurt to San Francisco. So the legs array would have two entries.

First, I need to get the fromId and toId for each leg. So:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Shanghai.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Frankfurt.
3. Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco.

Assuming the first leg is from Shanghai to Frankfurt, the second leg is Frankfurt to San Francisco. So the legs would be:

[
  {fromId: SHANGHAI_ID, toId: FRANKFURT_ID, date: 2024-12-05},
  {fromId: FRANKFURT_ID, toId: SAN_FRANCISCO_ID, date: 2024-12-05}
]

Wait, but the date for the second leg would depend on the layover. If the first flight departs on Dec 5, the second flight might depart the same day or the next. However, the user wants a layover in Frankfurt, so the second leg's date would be the same day if the layover is not overnight. But the user specified "around December 5, 2024," so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will look for dates within 5 days before and after. The tool will return the cheapest dates, which might be Dec 5, 6, etc.

But the user wants to depart around Dec 5, so the initial legs would have the date as Dec 5, but the actual flight might be on a different date within the 5-day window. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will return the cheapest dates, so the legs' dates might be adjusted.

Once the cheapest dates are found, the next step is to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those specific dates to get the offerToken. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with that offerToken.

So the steps are:

1. Get location IDs for Shanghai, Frankfurt, San Francisco.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs (Shanghai to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to SF) and date around Dec 5, 2024.
3. From the response, get the cheapest dates and ensure layover is not overnight.
4. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the specific dates and parameters to get the offerToken.
5. Use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user's query is to "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and get the seat map for the flight." So the first tool call is to get the location IDs, then Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, then Get_Seat_Map.

However, the user might not have provided all the necessary parameters. For example, the legs require fromId and toId, which are obtained via Search_Flight_Location. So the first three tool calls would be to get the IDs for each city.

Assuming the user's friend is traveling as an adult, the adults parameter is 1, and no children are mentioned. The cabin class is not specified, so default to ECONOMY. The sort parameter for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be CHEAPEST to get the cheapest options.

Now, let's outline the tool calls:
