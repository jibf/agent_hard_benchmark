2025-08-14 17:32:02,337 - evaluation_logger_Cross-217 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from Miami on November 15, 2024, going to Orlando and Tampa, then returning to Miami. I'm expecting to stay in each city for seven days. My address is 700 Ocean Dr in Miami. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want the cheapest connecting flight from Miami on November 15, 2024, to Orlando and Tampa, then back to Miami. They need to stay seven days in each city. Also, they need a taxi to the airport three hours before departure and back home one hour after landing.

Starting with the flights: The user is asking for a multi-stop flight. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool seems appropriate here. I need to get the location IDs for Miami, Orlando, and Tampa airports. To do that, I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool for each city to find their airport IDs. 

Wait, the user mentioned their address in Miami, but the flight is from Miami, so probably Miami International Airport (MIA). But maybe I should confirm using the Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami International Airport" to get the correct ID. Similarly for Orlando (MCO) and Tampa (TPA). 

Once I have the IDs, I can structure the legs. The first leg is from Miami to Orlando on Nov 15. Then Orlando to Tampa, but when? Since they stay seven days, the departure from Orlando to Tampa would be Nov 22. Then return from Tampa to Miami. But the return date isn't specified. The user wants to return to Miami after staying seven days in Tampa, so that would be Nov 29. 

So the legs would be:
1. MIA to MCO on 2024-11-15
2. MCO to TPA on 2024-11-22
3. TPA to MIA on 2024-11-29

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool requires an array of legs. However, the return leg from Tampa to Miami isn't part of the initial multi-stop. Wait, maybe the user wants a round trip with multiple stops. But the tool is for multi-stops in a single journey. The user's request is a round trip with two stops, but the tool might not handle that. Hmm, maybe the user needs three separate legs: outbound to Orlando, then to Tampa, then return to Miami. But the tool's example shows multiple legs in one direction. Maybe the return is a separate search. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a multi-city trip, which the tool can handle if the legs are structured correctly. 

Assuming the tool can handle it, I'll proceed. The legs array would include the three legs as mentioned. The cabin class is not specified, so default to ECONOMY. The sort parameter should be CHEAPEST. Adults are 1 by default unless specified, but the user didn't mention the number of adults. Wait, the user says "I'm expecting" so probably 1 adult. Children aren't mentioned, so maybe none. 

Next, the taxi bookings. The user needs a taxi from their address to the airport three hours before the flight and back after landing. To use the Search_Taxi tool, I need the pick-up and drop-off place IDs. The address is 700 Ocean Dr, Miami. So first, get the pick-up place ID using Taxi_Search_Location with query "700 Ocean Dr, Miami". The drop-off would be the airport, so for the outbound flight, the drop-off is Miami airport (MIA), and for the return, it's the same address. 

But the user's first taxi is to the airport for the initial flight (Miami to Orlando). The return taxi is from Tampa airport to home. So for the outbound taxi, pick-up is 700 Ocean Dr, drop-off is MIA. For the return, pick-up is TPA airport, drop-off is 700 Ocean Dr. 

But the user might need two separate taxi bookings: one for each direction. However, the user mentioned "book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands." So two separate taxi rides. 

First, for the departure flight (Miami to Orlando), the taxi would be from home to MIA. The pick-up date is the same as the flight's departure date (Nov 15), and the pick-up time is three hours before the flight's departure time. But the flight's departure time isn't known yet; it depends on the flight search result. Since the flight info isn't available yet, maybe the taxi booking can't be made until after the flight is booked. But the user is asking to book the taxi as part of the current request. Hmm, this might require first getting the flight details, then using that to schedule the taxi. However, the user's query is a single request, so perhaps the assistant needs to first find the flights, then use the flight times to book the taxis. But since the tools are separate, the assistant would need to chain the calls. 

But in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first step is to search for the flights. Once the flight details are known, then the taxi can be booked with the specific times. However, the user is asking for the entire process in one go. Since the taxi requires the flight's departure and arrival times, which are not yet known, the assistant might need to proceed in steps. 

But given the tools available, the assistant can first call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight options. Then, once the flight times are known, use Taxi_Search_Location to get the place IDs for the addresses and airports, then call Search_Taxi for each leg. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant should start by addressing the flight search. The taxi part can be handled after the flight is booked. However, the user might expect the assistant to handle both in sequence. 

So the first tool call is to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as outlined. Then, after getting the flight details, proceed to book the taxis. 

Now, for the flight search parameters: adults is 1 (default), children not mentioned, so no children parameter. The legs array is three entries. The cabin class is ECONOMY, sort is CHEAPEST. 

Next, the taxi part. The user's address is 700 Ocean Dr, Miami. To get the pick-up place ID, use Taxi_Search_Location with query "700 Ocean Dr, Miami". The drop-off for the first taxi is MIA airport, which can be found via Taxi_Search_Location with "Miami International Airport". Similarly, for the return taxi, the drop-off is the same address, and the pick-up is TPA airport. 

But again, the taxi booking requires the pick-up time and date, which depends on the flight's departure time. Since the flight's departure time isn't known yet, the taxi can't be booked immediately. So the assistant would need to first get the flight details, then proceed to book the taxi. 

In summary, the first step is to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the three legs. Then, once the flight times are known, use Taxi_Search_Location for the addresses and airports, then call Search_Taxi for each taxi ride. 

But the user's question is a single request, so the assistant should start with the flight search. The taxi part will require subsequent steps once the flight details are available. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as specified. The parameters would be:

- adults: 1
- legs: [
  { fromId: 'MIA.AIRPORT', toId: 'MCO.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-15' },
  { fromId: 'MCO.AIRPORT', toId: 'TPA.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-22' },
  { fromId: 'TPA.AIRPORT', toId: 'MIA.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-29' }
]
- sort: CHEAPEST

But wait, the return leg from Tampa to Miami is on 2024-11-29. The user stays seven days in each city. From Nov 15 to Nov 22 is seven days in Orlando. Then from Nov 22 to Nov 29 is seven days in Tampa. Then return to Miami on Nov 29. 

So the legs are correct. 

Now, the tool requires the fromId and toId to be the location IDs obtained from Search_Flight_Location. So before calling Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, the assistant should first get the IDs for Miami, Orlando, and Tampa airports. 

But the user's message doesn't mention the IDs, so the assistant needs to first call Search_Flight_Location for each airport. 

For example, for Miami: call Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami International Airport", get the id. Similarly for Orlando and Tampa. 

But the assistant can't do that in one step. So the first step is to get the location IDs for the airports. 

So the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for Miami, then Orlando, then Tampa. But since the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, the first response would be to call Search_Flight_Location for Miami. 

But the user's question is complex, and the assistant needs to handle it step by step. However, the user expects a single response. Given the constraints, the assistant should start by searching for the flight locations. 

But the user's main request is about the flight and taxi, so the assistant should first get the necessary IDs
