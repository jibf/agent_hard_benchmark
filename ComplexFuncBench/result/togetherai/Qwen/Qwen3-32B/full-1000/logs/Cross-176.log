Okay, let me break down how I arrived at the answer. The user asked for attractions near Hotel Route-Inn Sakaide-Kita Inter in Takamatsu with detailed descriptions.

First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool with the provided hotel_id (404817). The response mentioned Takamatsu Symbol Tower as a close landmark. But the user wanted more details, so I needed to find more info on that attraction.

Next, I used Search_Attraction_Location with the query "Takamatsu Symbol Tower" to get the slug or product ID. The response gave a productSlug which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details tool. 

The details from Get_Attraction_Details provided a comprehensive description of the private guided tour, including what's included, the experience of making udon, visiting Ritsurin Park, and other important info like cancellation policy and price. 

I compiled this information into a coherent answer, highlighting the key points the user would care about, like the tour activities, inclusions, price, and practical details. I made sure to present it clearly and concisely, ensuring all the necessary details were covered based on the tool responses.
