Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They need help finding the best business class flights for a trip from Rome to Milan and Venice, with a return to Rome on December 14th. They want detailed flight info and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The trip has three main parts: Rome to Milan, Milan to Venice, and then Venice back to Rome. Wait, actually, the user mentioned leaving Rome on Nov 30th, visiting Milan and Venice, and returning on Dec 14th. So maybe it's Rome to Milan, then Milan to Venice, and then Venice back to Rome? Or is it Rome to Milan, stay a week, then Milan to Venice, stay a week, then Venice back to Rome? The dates are Nov 30 to Dec 14, so two weeks total. They stay in each city for a week. So the outbound flights would be Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7, and return flights Venice to Rome on Dec 14. But the user might have a multi-stop flight for the outbound and return. Alternatively, maybe they fly Rome to Milan, stay a week, then fly Milan to Venice for another week, then return Venice to Rome. So three legs: Rome-Milan, Milan-Venice, Venice-Rome. But the user might want the best business class flights for each leg. 

To find the flights, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. The legs would be from Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7, and then Venice to Rome on Dec 14. Wait, but the return is on Dec 14. So maybe the outbound is Rome to Milan, then Milan to Venice, and the return is Venice to Rome. But the user might have a round trip with multiple stops. Alternatively, maybe the outbound is Rome to Milan, stay a week, then Milan to Venice, stay a week, then return from Venice to Rome. So the legs for the outbound are Rome-Milan and Milan-Venice, and the return is Venice-Rome. But the user's query says they leave Rome on Nov 30 and return on Dec 14. So the outbound is Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7, and the return is Venice to Rome on Dec 14. 

So for the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops, the legs would be:

1. fromId: Rome's airport (FCO or FCO.AIRPORT?), toId: Milan's airport (MIL or Linate?), date: 2024-11-30
2. fromId: Milan's airport, toId: Venice's airport (VCE?), date: 2024-12-07
3. fromId: Venice's airport, toId: Rome's airport, date: 2024-12-14

But wait, the user is staying in each city for a week. So the first leg is Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then after a week, Milan to Venice on Dec 7, then after another week, Venice back to Rome on Dec 14. So the legs are three in total. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, which usually refers to a single journey with multiple stops. However, in this case, the user is making a round trip with two destinations. So maybe the outbound is Rome to Milan to Venice, and the return is Venice to Rome. But the user's schedule is Rome to Milan (week), Milan to Venice (week), then return from Venice to Rome. So the outbound is two legs, and the return is one leg. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for a single trip, not round trip. Hmm, maybe the user needs to book three separate flights: Rome-Milan, Milan-Venice, and Venice-Rome. But the user wants the best business class flights for the journey. Alternatively, maybe there's a multi-stop flight from Rome to Venice via Milan, but that's a one-way trip. The return would be a separate flight. 

This is a bit confusing. The user's request is for a trip that starts in Rome, goes to Milan, then Venice, and returns to Rome. The dates are Nov 30 to Dec 14. So the outbound flights are Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7, and the return is Venice to Rome on Dec 14. So three separate flights. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights in a single journey. So perhaps the outbound is a multi-stop flight from Rome to Milan to Venice, but that would be a single trip, and then the return is a separate flight. However, the user might have a round trip with multiple stops. But the tool's example shows legs as an array, so maybe the user can specify multiple legs for the outbound and return. Wait, the tool's parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops require an array of legs. Each leg is fromId, toId, date. So for a round trip with multiple stops, the legs would include the outbound and return. But the example given in the tool's description is for a single direction. For example, the example shows legs as [ {fromId: BOM.AIRPORT, toId: AMD.AIRPORT, date: 2024-05-25 }, ... ] which is a one-way multi-stop. So perhaps the user needs to make two separate calls: one for the outbound multi-stop (Rome to Milan to Venice) and another for the return (Venice to Rome). But the user's return is on a specific date, Dec 14, so the return is a single leg. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to search for the outbound trip (Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7) and the return trip (Venice to Rome on Dec 14). So two separate multi-stop searches? Or three separate single flights. 

But the user is asking for the best business class flights for the entire journey. So perhaps the assistant should first search for the outbound legs (Rome to Milan and Milan to Venice) as a multi-stop flight, then search for the return leg (Venice to Rome). However, the multi-stop search is for a single journey, so the outbound would be Rome to Milan to Venice, but the dates are Nov 30 and Dec 7. Wait, the first leg is Nov 30, the second leg is Dec 7. That's a week apart. So the multi-stop flight would be Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then after a week, Milan to Venice on Dec 7. But multi-stop flights typically have consecutive legs. So maybe the user needs to book two separate flights: Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7. Then the return is Venice to Rome on Dec 14. 

In that case, the assistant would need to make three separate flight searches: two for the outbound (Rome-Milan and Milan-Venice) and one for the return (Venice-Rome). But the user wants the best business class flights for the entire journey. So perhaps the assistant should use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool for the outbound legs (Rome to Milan on Nov 30, then Milan to Venice on Dec 7) and another for the return leg (Venice to Rome on Dec 14). Wait, but the return is a single leg. So maybe the assistant should make two calls: one for the outbound multi-stop and one for the return. 

But the user's request is to find the best business class flights for the entire journey. So the assistant needs to first get the flight details for each leg. 

First, the assistant needs to get the location IDs for Rome, Milan, and Venice airports. Using the Search_Flight_Location tool with queries "Rome", "Milan", and "Venice" to get their respective airport IDs. For example, Rome's main airport is FCO (Leonardo da Vinci), Milan's is MXP (Malpensa), and Venice's is VCE (Marco Polo). 

Once the location IDs are obtained, the assistant can use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool for the outbound journey. The legs would be:

1. fromId: FCO.AIRPORT, toId: MXP.AIRPORT, date: 2024-11-30
2. fromId: MXP.AIRPORT, toId: VCE.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-07

Cabin class is BUSINESS, sort by BEST. 

Then, for the return journey, another Search_Flights_Multi_Stops call with:

1. fromId: VCE.AIRPORT, toId: FCO.AIRPORT, date: 2024-12-14

Cabin class BUSINESS, sort by BEST. 

But wait, the return is a single leg, so maybe using the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with one leg is acceptable. 

Once the flight tokens are obtained from the search, the assistant can use Get_Flight_Details to get detailed info for each flight, and Get_Seat_Map to retrieve the seat maps using the offerToken from the search results. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for Rome's airport ID (FCO.AIRPORT)
2. Search for Milan's airport ID (MXP.AIRPORT)
3. Search for Venice
