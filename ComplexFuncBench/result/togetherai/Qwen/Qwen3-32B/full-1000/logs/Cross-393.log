2025-08-14 19:29:54,700 - evaluation_logger_Cross-393 - INFO - Query: It's 10 o'clock in the morning on December 5, 2024. I just had breakfast at the Boston Marriott Copley Place. All local flights in Boston have been canceled due to heavy rain. I need to catch a taxi to an airport in a nearby city to fly to Toronto right away. Could you find a taxi for me and check the corresponding flight information?

Okay, let's tackle this user's problem step by step. First, the user is in Boston and needs to get to a nearby airport to fly to Toronto because all local Boston flights are canceled. They want a taxi to take them to a nearby city's airport.

First, I need to find the taxi service. The user mentioned they're at the Boston Marriott Copley Place. So, the pick-up location is that hotel. I'll need the googlePlaceId for the hotel. The Taxi_Search_Location tool can help here. The query parameter would be "Boston Marriott Copley Place". Once I get the pick-up place ID, I can proceed.

Next, the drop-off location should be an airport in a nearby city. But which airport? Since the user wants to fly to Toronto, maybe the nearest major airport that has flights to Toronto. However, the user hasn't specified the destination airport yet. Wait, the user just wants to go to Toronto, so maybe the destination is Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) or another airport in Toronto. But the taxi is to get to a nearby city's airport. So perhaps the user needs to fly from a different airport, like maybe Hartford (BID), Providence (PVD), or another nearby airport that's operational. But the user hasn't specified which airport, so maybe the taxi is to take them to a different airport, like maybe Logan International in Boston is closed, so they need to go to a nearby city's airport. Wait, but all local Boston flights are canceled. So maybe the user is looking for an alternative airport nearby that's still operational. For example, maybe Albany (ALB), Hartford (BID), or even Philadelphia (PHL) if that's closer. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the taxi is to take them to the nearest alternative airport. However, the user hasn't provided that info. So maybe the assistant needs to first find the taxi to a nearby airport, but which one? The user might not know, so perhaps the assistant should first find the taxi to a nearby airport, but the user hasn't specified the destination airport. Wait, the user's goal is to fly to Toronto, so the taxi is to get to an airport that can fly to Toronto. So maybe the assistant needs to first find the taxi to a nearby airport (like Hartford or Providence) and then check flights from there to Toronto. But the user hasn't specified the destination airport, so the assistant might need to first find the taxi to a nearby airport, then check flights from that airport to Toronto. However, the user's immediate request is to find a taxi to a nearby city's airport and check the corresponding flight info. So the steps would be:

1. Find the pick-up location's googlePlaceId (Boston Marriott Copley Place).
2. Find the drop-off location's googlePlaceId (the nearby airport's place ID).
3. Use the Search_Taxi tool with the pick-up and drop-off IDs and the current time (10 AM on Dec 5) to find taxi options.
4. Then, check flights from that airport to Toronto on the same day (Dec 5) since the user wants to fly right away.

But the user hasn't specified which airport to go to, so the assistant might need to first determine which nearby airports are operational and have flights to Toronto. However, the user's immediate request is to find a taxi to a nearby city's airport. So perhaps the assistant should first find the taxi to a nearby airport (like Hartford or Providence) and then check flights from there. But since the user hasn't specified the destination airport, the assistant might need to make an assumption or ask for clarification. However, the user wants the assistant to handle it, so maybe the assistant can proceed by first finding the taxi to a nearby airport (like Hartford) and then check flights from there. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can first find the taxi to the nearest alternative airport, then check flights from there to Toronto. But the user hasn't specified the destination airport, so the assistant might need to first find the taxi to a nearby airport, then check flights from that airport to Toronto. However, the user's query is to find a taxi and check the corresponding flight info. So the assistant needs to first get the taxi info, then the flight info. But the flight info requires knowing the departure airport (fromId) and arrival airport (toId). The arrival airport is Toronto, so the toId would be Toronto Pearson (YYZ) or another Toronto airport. But the user hasn't specified, so the assistant might need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the toId for Toronto. Then, the fromId would be the nearby airport (like Hartford's airport ID). But the user hasn't specified which nearby airport, so the assistant might need to first find the taxi to a nearby airport, but which one? The user might not know, so the assistant might need to find the nearest operational airport to Boston that has flights to Toronto. However, the assistant's tools don't include flight availability, but the Search_Flights tool can be used once the fromId and toId are known. So the steps would be:

1. Use Taxi_Search_Location for the pick-up (Boston Marriott Copley Place) to get its googlePlaceId.
2. Use Taxi_Search_Location for the drop-off (nearby airport, e.g., Hartford Bradley International Airport) to get its googlePlaceId.
3. Use Search_Taxi with the pick-up and drop-off IDs, current date and time (Dec 5, 10:00 AM) to get taxi options.
4. Use Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get its airport's toId.
5. Use Search_Flight_Location for the nearby airport (Hartford) to get its fromId.
6. Use Search_Flights with fromId (Hartford), toId (Toronto), departDate (Dec 5), and sort by FASTEST or CHEAPEST to find available flights.

But the user hasn't specified the nearby airport, so the assistant might need to assume a specific one. Alternatively, the assistant could first find the nearby cities around Boston using Get_Nearby_Cities, then check their airports. However, the user's main goal is to get to a nearby airport to fly to Toronto. So perhaps the assistant should first find the taxi to a nearby airport, but which one? Since the user is in Boston, nearby airports could be Hartford (BID), Providence (PVD), or maybe even Albany (ALB). The assistant might need to use the Taxi_Search_Location for each of these airports to get their place IDs. But the user hasn't specified, so the assistant might need to proceed with one of them. Alternatively, the assistant could first find the nearby cities using Get_Nearby_Cities with Boston's coordinates, then check their airports. But the user's current location is Boston, so the nearby cities would be around Boston. However, the user needs to go to an airport in a nearby city, so perhaps the assistant should first get the nearby cities, then find their airports. But this might be a longer process. Given the time constraints (user wants to catch a taxi right away), the assistant should proceed with the most likely nearby airports. For example, Hartford Bradley International Airport (BID) is about 45 minutes from Boston. So the assistant could use Taxi_Search_Location for "Hartford Bradley International Airport" to get its place ID. Then proceed with the taxi search and flight search.

So, the first step is to get the pick-up place ID (Boston Marriott Copley Place) using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, get the drop-off place ID (Hartford Bradley International Airport) using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, use Search_Taxi with those IDs and the current date/time. Then, use Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get the toId, and for Hartford to get the fromId. Then, use Search_Flights with those IDs and the departDate (Dec 5) to find available flights.

But the user's message is to find a taxi and check the corresponding flight info. So the assistant needs to first handle the taxi part, then the flight part. Let's start with the taxi.

First, call Taxi_Search_Location for the pick-up location: "Boston Marriott Copley Place". Then, call Taxi_Search_Location for the drop-off location: "Hartford Bradley International Airport". Then, use those place IDs in Search_Taxi. Then, for flights, use Search_Flight_Location for "Toronto Pearson International Airport" to get toId, and for "Hartford Bradley International Airport" to get fromId. Then, use Search_Flights with those IDs and departDate Dec 5.

But the user might not have specified Hartford, so the assistant might need to first find the nearby cities around Boston to determine which airports are nearby. However, the Get_Nearby_Cities tool requires latitude and longitude. The user is in Boston, so the assistant needs to get Boston's coordinates using Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Boston". Then, use those coordinates in Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities, which might include cities with airports. Then, for each nearby city, find the airport's place ID. But this is a multi-step process. However, given the time constraints, the assistant might need to proceed with the most likely nearby airport. Alternatively, the assistant could first get the nearby cities, then check their airports. Let's outline the steps:

1. Use Location_to_Lat_Long for "Boston" to get latitude and longitude.
2. Use Get_Nearby_Cities with those coordinates to find nearby cities.
3. For each nearby city, use Taxi_Search_Location to find the airport's place ID.
4. Use Search_Taxi with the pick-up (Marriott) and drop-off (airport) place IDs.
5. Use
