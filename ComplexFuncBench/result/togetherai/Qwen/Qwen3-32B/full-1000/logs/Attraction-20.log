Okay, let me process the user's query and the previous interactions. The user initially asked about the Stone Forest after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool to find relevant attractions, which returned three options. The user probably wanted more details on the first one, so I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the first product.

The response from Get_Attraction_Details provided comprehensive information about the Stone Forest Day Tour. Now, I need to summarize this data into a user-friendly answer. The user might be looking to book this tour, so I should highlight key details like what's included, pricing, cancellation policy, and any important notes from the additional info. Also, the review mentioned is negative, so I should include that warning. I'll structure the response to cover description, inclusions, exclusions, pricing, cancellation, and practical information. Make sure to mention the operator and the location (Kunming) to help the user decide. Check if there are any requirements like minimum age or group size. Avoid technical terms and keep it conversational.
