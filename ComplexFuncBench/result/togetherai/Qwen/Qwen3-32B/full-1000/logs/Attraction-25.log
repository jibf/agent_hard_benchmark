2025-08-14 20:40:46,752 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me break down the information the user asked for. They wanted details about Westminster Abbey after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Westminster Abbey" as the query. That gave me the product slug needed for the next step. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug to get the full info.

The response from the second tool has a lot of details. The description mentions it's a historic site with coronations and royal weddings. I should highlight the key points like the historical significance, notable burials, and the private tour details. Also, the cancellation policy and price are important for someone planning to visit. I need to present this in a clear, conversational way without using markdown. Make sure to mention the operator, what's included, and any restrictions like age requirements. Keep it concise but informative so the user gets all the necessary info to decide if they want to book the tour.
