2025-08-14 17:31:09,592 - evaluation_logger_Cross-213 - INFO - Query: I want to find out about the cheapest connecting flight leaving from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to San Francisco. I'm expecting to stay in each city for ten days. My address is 600 Market St in San Francisco. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want the cheapest connecting flight from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, to San Diego and Las Vegas, then back to San Francisco. They need to stay ten days in each city. Also, they want a taxi booked three hours before departure and one hour after return.

Starting with the flights: the user is asking for a multi-stop flight. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool seems appropriate here. The legs would be SFO to SAN, SAN to LAS, and LAS back to SFO. Each leg's date needs to be calculated. Since they stay ten days in each city, the return flight from LAS to SFO would be December 5 + 10 days (to SAN) + 10 days (to LAS) + 10 days back? Wait, that might not add up. Let me think. If they leave SF on Dec 5 to SD, stay 10 days, then go to LV, another 10 days, then return. So the first leg is Dec 5, the second leg would be Dec 15 (after 10 days in SD), third leg Dec 25 (after 10 days in LV). But the user might not have specified the exact return date, so maybe I need to confirm. However, the user hasn't provided the return date, so perhaps the tool can handle it with the legs array. The cabin class is not specified, so default to ECONOMY. Sort by CHEAPEST.

Next, the taxi bookings. For the outbound flight, they need a taxi from 600 Market St, SF to the airport (SFO) three hours before departure. For the return flight, from LAS airport to home one hour after landing. To use the Search_Taxi tool, I need the pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. The user's address is 600 Market St, SF. So I need to get the googlePlaceId for that address using Taxi_Search_Location. Similarly, the airport's place ID for SFO and LAS. But the user didn't specify the airports, but the flight legs use SAN, LAS, SFO. So for the first taxi, pick up is 600 Market St (SF) to SFO. For the return, LAS airport to 600 Market St. Also, need the pick_up_time and date. The flight's departure time isn't known yet, so maybe after getting the flight details, the taxi can be booked with the specific time. But the user wants to book the taxi now, which might require the flight details first. So the process would be: first get the flight info, then use the flight's departure and arrival times to set the taxi times. However, since the flight details aren't known yet, maybe the taxi booking has to be conditional on the flight booking. But the user is asking to book the taxi now, so perhaps the taxi tool can be called with the dates and times based on the flight legs. For example, the outbound flight is Dec 5, so the taxi pick up date is Dec 5, pick up time 3 hours before the flight's departure time. But without knowing the flight's exact time, this might not be possible. Maybe the user expects the taxi to be scheduled for the date, and the time will be adjusted later once the flight is booked. Alternatively, the taxi tool might require the exact time, so perhaps the assistant needs to proceed with the flight search first, then use the flight's departure and arrival times to book the taxis. But the user's message is a single request, so the assistant needs to handle it in steps. 

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the fromId and toId for each city (San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas). The query parameters would be "San Francisco", "San Diego", "Las Vegas". Each will return an id like "SFO.AIRPORT", "SAN.AIRPORT", "LAS.AIRPORT".

2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: from SFO to SAN on Dec 5, SAN to LAS on Dec 15 (assuming 10 days in SD), LAS to SFO on Dec 25 (10 days in LV). But the user didn't specify the exact dates for the return legs, so maybe the assistant needs to calculate based on 10 days stay. However, the user might not have provided the return dates, so perhaps the tool can be called with the legs as specified, but the dates need to be inferred. Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the original query again. The user says "leaving from San Francisco on December 5, 2024, going to San Diego and Las Vegas, then returning to San Francisco. I'm expecting to stay in each city for ten days." So the first leg is Dec 5 SFO to SAN. They stay 10 days in SD, so the next flight from SD to LV would be Dec 15. Then stay 10 days in LV, returning on Dec 25. So the legs are:

- Leg 1: SFO to SAN, date 2024-12-05
- Leg 2: SAN to LAS, date 2024-12-15
- Leg 3: LAS to SFO, date 2024-12-25

But the user wants a return flight, so maybe the last leg is from LAS back to SFO. So the legs array would have three entries. The adults count is not specified, default to 1. Sort by CHEAPEST.

Once the flight is booked, get the flight details including departure and arrival times. Then, for the taxi:

- Outbound taxi: pick up from 600 Market St, SF (get place ID via Taxi_Search_Location) to SFO airport (get place ID via Taxi_Search_Location). Pick up date is 2024-12-05, time 3 hours before the flight's departure time. But since the flight's time isn't known yet, maybe the user expects the taxi to be scheduled for the date, and the time will be adjusted later. However, the tool requires pick_up_time in HH:MM format. So perhaps the assistant needs to proceed with the flight search first, then use the flight's time to set the taxi time. But since the user is asking to book the taxi now, maybe the assistant can proceed with the taxi tool once the flight's time is known. However, in the current step, the assistant can only call the flight search, then in a subsequent step, after getting the flight details, call the taxi tool. But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle it in one go. 

Alternatively, the assistant can first get the place IDs for the taxi locations. For the pick up location (600 Market St, SF), use Taxi_Search_Location with query "600 Market St, San Francisco". Similarly, for the drop off (SFO airport), use "San Francisco International Airport". Then, for the return taxi, from LAS airport to 600 Market St. 

So the steps are:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the fromId and toId for the flight legs.

2. Call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs, sorted by CHEAPEST.

3. Once the flight is found, get the departure and arrival times for the outbound and return flights.

4. Call Taxi_Search_Location for the user's address and the airports.

5. Call Search_Taxi for the outbound and return trips with the appropriate dates and times.

But since the user is asking for all this in one go, the assistant needs to chain these calls. However, in the current setup, each tool call is separate. So the assistant would first need to call the flight search, then the taxi search. But the user's message is a single request, so the assistant must first handle the flight part, then the taxi part. 

So first, the flight part:

- Use Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas to get their IDs.

- Then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as specified.

Then, for the taxi:

- Use Taxi_Search_Location for 600 Market St, San Francisco to get the pick_up_place_id.

- Use Taxi_Search_Location for SFO and LAS airports to get the drop_off_place_id for the outbound and return trips.

- Then call Search_Taxi for each leg (outbound and return) with the appropriate dates and times.

But the user hasn't provided the return flight's arrival time, so the return taxi's pick_up_time (after landing) can't be determined without the flight details. Therefore, the assistant must first get the flight details, then proceed with the taxi bookings. However, in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first step is to call the flight search, then the taxi search. But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle it step by step.

In the first tool call, the assistant would call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the IDs. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Then, once the flight is found, proceed to the taxi part. However, the user's message is a single request, so the assistant must first handle the flight part, then the taxi part. But since the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, the first step is to call the flight location search for the cities involved
