2025-08-14 17:24:54,091 - evaluation_logger_Cross-174 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me break down how I arrived at the answer. The user asked for attractions near the Chisun Hotel Hiroshima (hotel_id 313854) and detailed descriptions.

First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool with the hotel_id. It returned the Memorial Cathedral for World Peace, which is close by. But the data was minimal, so I needed more details.

Next, I called Search_Attraction_Location with the cathedral's name to get the slug. The response provided a productSlug, which I then used in Get_Attraction_Details. 

The details from Get_Attraction_Details gave a comprehensive description of the Peace Memorial tour, including the itinerary, inclusions, and practical info. I structured this information into a coherent answer, highlighting key points like the tour route, what's included, and important notes for the user. I made sure to present it clearly, focusing on the most relevant details for someone planning a visit.
