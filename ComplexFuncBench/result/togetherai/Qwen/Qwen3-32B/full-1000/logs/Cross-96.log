Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to travel from New York to Los Angeles on December 1, 2024, and need help finding the best flight tickets. Also, they need a taxi arranged for both pickup from their hotel in New York and a drop-off at their friend's hotel in Los Angeles.

First, for the flights, I need to use the Search_Flights tool. The required parameters are toId, fromId, and departDate. To get these IDs, I should first call the Search_Flight_Location tool for both New York and Los Angeles. The user mentioned Shangri-La Hotel New York as the departure point and Marriott Hotel Los Angeles as the destination. However, the flight tool requires airport IDs, not hotel names. So, I need to find the nearest airports to these hotels. For New York, the main airport is JFK, and for Los Angeles, it's LAX. I'll use the Search_Flight_Location tool with queries "JFK" and "LAX" to get their IDs. Once I have the fromId and toId, I can proceed with the Search_Flights tool, setting the departDate to 2024-12-01. The user wants the best flights, so the sort parameter should be "BEST". They didn't specify the number of adults or children, so I'll default adults to 1 and assume no children unless stated.

Next, for the taxi arrangements, I need to use the Taxi_Search_Location tool to get the googlePlaceIds for both the Shangri-La Hotel New York and the Marriott Hotel Los Angeles. The user specified the pickup time as 10 AM on the departure date, so the pick_up_date is 2024-12-01 and pick_up_time is 10:00. The drop_off_place_id for the New York pickup and the pick_up_place_id for the Los Angeles drop-off will be needed for the Search_Taxi tool. I'll need to call Taxi_Search_Location with the hotel names to get their respective googlePlaceIds. Once those are retrieved, I can then use the Search_Taxi tool for both the outbound and return trips. Wait, actually, the user needs two taxi services: one from Shangri-La to the airport and another from the airport to Marriott. But the Search_Taxi tool requires drop_off and pick_up_place_ids. So for the first taxi, the pick_up_place_id is Shangri-La's googlePlaceId and the drop_off_place_id is JFK's. For the second taxi, the pick_up_place_id is LAX's and the drop_off_place_id is Marriott's. However, the user mentioned the taxi should wait at the LA airport upon landing. So maybe the second taxi is a drop-off at the hotel, so the drop_off_place_id is Marriott's. But the Search_Taxi tool's parameters are pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id. So for the first taxi, pick_up is Shangri-La, drop_off is JFK. For the return, if the user is coming back, but the user hasn't mentioned a return date. Wait, the user only mentioned a one-way trip to LA. So the taxi from LA airport to Marriott is a one-time drop-off. So I need to call Search_Taxi once for the departure and once for the arrival? But the user hasn't specified a return date, so maybe only the outbound taxi is needed. Wait, the user said "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport", implying both ways. But since the flight is one-way, maybe the user is planning a return, but it's not specified. Hmm. The user's message is a bit ambiguous. Since the flight is only for December 1, maybe the taxi is only for that day. But the user might need a taxi to the airport and another from the airport to the hotel in LA. So two separate taxi bookings. But the Search_Taxi tool requires pick_up and drop_off. So first, from Shangri-La to JFK, then from LAX to Marriott. So I need to call Taxi_Search_Location for both hotels and the airports. Wait, but the airports' googlePlaceIds might not be needed if the user is going to the airport itself. Wait, the user is leaving from Shangri-La Hotel to the airport (JFK), so the drop_off_place_id is JFK's googlePlaceId. Similarly, arriving at LAX and needing a taxi to Marriott, so the pick_up_place_id is LAX's googlePlaceId and drop_off is Marriott's. So I need to get the googlePlaceIds for Shangri-La Hotel, JFK, LAX, and Marriott Hotel. 

So the steps are:

1. For flights:
   a. Search_Flight_Location for "JFK" to get fromId.
   b. Search_Flight_Location for "LAX" to get toId.
   c. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-01, sort=BEST.

2. For taxi:
   a. Taxi_Search_Location for "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get pick_up_place_id.
   b. Taxi_Search_Location for "JFK Airport" to get drop_off_place_id for the first taxi.
   c. Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id (Shangri-La) and drop_off_place_id (JFK), pick_up_date=2024-12-01, pick_up_time=10:00.
   d. Taxi_Search_Location for "LAX Airport" to get pick_up_place_id for the second taxi.
   e. Taxi_Search_Location for "Marriott Hotel Los Angeles" to get drop_off_place_id.
   f. Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id (LAX) and drop_off_place_id (Marriott), but the user hasn't specified the arrival time. Since the flight's arrival time isn't given, maybe the taxi is scheduled for the same date, but the time isn't specified. The user said "when the plane lands", but without knowing the flight's arrival time, the taxi's pick_up_time can't be determined. However, the user might expect the taxi to be available upon arrival, so perhaps the time is left as default or the user will specify later. But the tool requires pick_up_time. Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe we can't proceed without it. However, the user might expect the system to handle it, so perhaps we can proceed with the available information, assuming the taxi is booked for the same date with a time to be determined later. Alternatively, the user might need to provide the arrival time once the flight is booked. Since the flight search is first, once the flight is selected, the arrival time can be used for the LA taxi. But since the flight hasn't been booked yet, the taxi for LA can't be scheduled yet. Therefore, perhaps the taxi for LA can't be arranged at this stage. The user might need to first get the flight details, then arrange the taxi based on the flight's arrival time. However, the user's request is to arrange both, so maybe the assistant should proceed with the taxi for LA as well, using the same date but without the time, but the tool requires pick_up_time. This is a problem. The user might have to provide the arrival time, but since it's not given, the assistant might need to make an assumption or note that the time is required. However, the user's message says "the taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands", implying that the taxi's pick-up time is when the plane lands, which depends on the flight's arrival time. Since the flight hasn't been booked yet, the taxi can't be scheduled with an exact time. Therefore, the assistant should first get the flight details, then use the arrival time from the flight to schedule the LA taxi. But since the user wants both arranged, the assistant might need to proceed with the flight search first, then use the flight's arrival time for the taxi. However, in the current step, the assistant can only make the initial calls. So perhaps the assistant will first call the flight search, then once the flight is selected, the taxi can be arranged. But in the current response, the assistant can only make the initial tool calls. Therefore, the assistant will proceed with the flight search and the taxi for the departure from New York, and note that the LA taxi requires the flight's arrival time. But the user might expect the assistant to handle both. Alternatively, the assistant can proceed with the LA taxi with a placeholder time, but that's not feasible. Therefore, the assistant will first handle the flight and the New York taxi, and then, once the flight's arrival time is known, the LA taxi can be arranged. However, the user's request is to arrange both, so the assistant should make the necessary tool calls for both, even if some parameters are missing. But the tool requires pick_up_time for the LA taxi. Since the user hasn't provided it, the assistant can't proceed. Therefore, the assistant should first get the flight details, then use the arrival time for the LA taxi. But in the current step, the assistant can only make the initial calls. So the assistant will proceed with the flight search and the New York taxi, and then, in a subsequent step, after the flight is selected, the LA taxi can be arranged. However, the user's message is a single request, so the assistant should make all necessary tool calls, even if some parameters are missing. But the tool requires pick_up_time for the LA taxi. Therefore, the assistant might need to make an assumption or proceed with the available information. Alternatively, the assistant can call the Taxi_Search_Location for the LA hotel and the airport
