Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to find two cheap hotels in Sydney from Nov 20 to 25, 2024, for two adults and a 6-year-old. The hotels need airport shuttle services, and they want to know the child policies.

First, I need to figure out the steps. The user mentioned hotels, so I should start by searching for Sydney's hotel destination. The Search_Hotel_Destination tool can get the dest_id and search_type needed for subsequent steps. 

Once I have the dest_id, the next step is to use Get_Filter to retrieve categories_filter, which includes amenities like airport shuttle. The user wants the cheapest options, so in Search_Hotels, I'll set sort_by to "price" and specify price_min and price_max if possible. But since the user didn't mention a price range, maybe just sort by price to get the cheapest first. Also, need to include the categories_filter from Get_Filter that includes airport shuttle service.

After getting the hotel list, I need to check the child policies for each of the two cheapest hotels. The Property_Children_Policies tool requires hotel_id, which comes from the Search_Hotels response. So first, get the hotel_ids from the search results, then call the policies tool for each.

Wait, the user is asking for two cheapest hotels. So after searching, I should select the top two based on price. Then, for each of those two, get their child policies. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sydney" to get dest_id and search_type.
2. Use Get_Filter with the dest_id and search_type, specifying room_qty=1, adults=2, children_age=6, arrival and departure dates. The categories_filter should include airport shuttle. But how to specify that? The Get_Filter's categories_filter might be a parameter that includes filters like amenities. Maybe the Get_Filter endpoint returns possible categories, but the user wants to filter by airport shuttle. Hmm, maybe the categories_filter is a parameter that needs to be set to include "airport shuttle" as a filter. But the exact value isn't clear. Maybe the Get_Filter is needed to get the correct categories_filter value to use in Search_Hotels. Alternatively, perhaps the categories_filter is a string that specifies the filters, like "amenities:airport_shuttle". The user wants hotels with airport shuttle, so the categories_filter should include that. But the exact format is not specified. The Get_Filter tool's description says categories_filter can be retrieved from that endpoint, but for the initial request, leave it blank. So maybe in Get_Filter, we need to specify the categories_filter as "amenities:airport_shuttle" or similar. But the user's instruction is to find hotels that provide airport shuttle, so the categories_filter should include that. However, the exact parameter format isn't given. Maybe the Get_Filter is used to get the available filters, but the user wants to apply a specific filter. This part is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the Search_Hotels tool's parameters include categories_filter, which can be set to filter by amenities. So after getting the categories_filter from Get_Filter, we can use it in Search_Hotels. But how to construct the categories_filter to include airport shuttle? Maybe the Get_Filter endpoint returns possible categories, and the user needs to select the correct one. Since the user wants airport shuttle, perhaps the categories_filter should be something like "amenities:airport_shuttle". 

Assuming that, the process would be:

- Use Search_Hotel_Destination to get dest_id and search_type for Sydney.
- Use Get_Filter with the dest_id, search_type, and other parameters (arrival_date, departure_date, adults=2, children_age=6, room_qty=1) to get the categories_filter that includes airport shuttle. But how to specify the categories_filter in Get_Filter? The Get_Filter's parameters include categories_filter, but the user wants to set it to include airport shuttle. Wait, the Get_Filter's description says that categories_filter can be retrieved from that endpoint, but for the initial request, leave it blank. So maybe the first call to Get_Filter is with categories_filter blank, and then subsequent calls can use the returned categories_filter. But the user wants to filter by airport shuttle, so perhaps the categories_filter needs to be set to include that. Maybe the categories_filter is a string that specifies the filters, like "amenities:airport_shuttle". 

Alternatively, perhaps the Get_Filter is used to get the available filters, and then in Search_Hotels, the categories_filter is applied. But the user's goal is to find hotels with airport shuttle, so the categories_filter should include that. 

This part is a bit tricky. Let me proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sydney" to get the dest_id and search_type. Then, use Get_Filter with the dest_id and search_type, along with arrival and departure dates, adults, children_age, and room_qty. The categories_filter parameter in Get_Filter might be used to specify the filters, but since the user wants to include airport shuttle, perhaps the categories_filter should be set to "amenities:airport_shuttle". However, the exact format isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Filter is used to get the possible categories, and then in Search_Hotels, the categories_filter is applied. 

Assuming that the Get_Filter is called first to get the categories_filter value, but the user wants to filter by airport shuttle, perhaps the categories_filter is a parameter that needs to be set. However, the Get_Filter's parameters include categories_filter, which is optional. For the initial request, it's left blank. So maybe the first step is to call Get_Filter without categories_filter to get the available filters, then use that to construct the categories_filter for Search_Hotels. But the user wants to filter by airport shuttle, so perhaps the categories_filter should be set to include that. 

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels tool's categories_filter parameter can be set directly to "amenities:airport_shuttle" without needing to call Get_Filter. But the tool's description says that categories_filter should be retrieved from Get_Filter. So perhaps the correct approach is to first call Get_Filter to get the categories_filter value that includes airport shuttle. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me check the tool descriptions again.

The Get_Filter tool's description says: "Get the `categories_filter` parameter value for `Search_Hotels` function." So the purpose of Get_Filter is to retrieve the categories_filter that can be used in Search_Hotels. The parameters for Get_Filter include categories_filter, which is optional. The user wants to filter by airport shuttle, so perhaps the categories_filter in Get_Filter should be set to include that. But how? The example isn't given. Maybe the categories_filter is a string that specifies the filters, like "amenities:airport_shuttle". 

Assuming that, the process would be:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sydney" to get dest_id and search_type.
2. Call Get_Filter with the dest_id, search_type, arrival_date, departure_date, adults=2, children_age=6, room_qty=1, and categories_filter="amenities:airport_shuttle" to get the categories_filter value.
3. Use the categories_filter from Get_Filter in the Search_Hotels call, along with sort_by="price" to get the cheapest hotels.
4. From the Search_Hotels results, select the two cheapest hotels and get their hotel_ids.
5. For each of those two hotel_ids, call Property_Children_Policies to get the child policies.

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. Let's outline each step with the correct parameters.

First, Search_Hotel_Destination:

- query: "Sydney"

This will return dest_id and search_type.

Next, Get_Filter:

- search_type: from previous step
- dest_id: from previous step
- arrival_date: 2024-11-20
- departure_date: 2024-11-25
- adults: 2
- children_age: "6"
- room_qty: 1
- categories_filter: "amenities:airport_shuttle" (assuming this is the correct format)

But the Get_Filter's parameters include categories_filter as optional. The user wants to filter by airport shuttle, so setting categories_filter to include that. However, the exact format isn't specified. The tool's description says that categories_filter can be retrieved from Get_Filter, but for the initial request, leave it blank. So maybe the first call to Get_Filter is with categories_filter blank, and then subsequent calls can use the returned categories_filter. But the user wants to apply a specific filter, so perhaps the categories_filter needs to be set. This is a bit unclear, but I'll proceed with the assumption that categories_filter can be set to "amenities:airport_shuttle".

Then, Search_Hotels:

- sort_by: "price"
- search_type: from Search_Hotel_Destination
- categories_filter: from Get_Filter
- dest_id: from Search_Hotel_Destination
- arrival_date: 2024-11-20
- departure_date: 2024-11-25
- adults: 2
- children_age: "6"
- room_qty: 1

This should return the hotels sorted by price, filtered by airport shuttle.

Once the two cheapest hotels are identified, their hotel_ids are used in Property_Children_Policies to get the child policies.

So the first tool call is Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Sydney".
