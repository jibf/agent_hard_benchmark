Okay, the user wants to know the reviews for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto during their stay from December 30, 2024, to January 3, 2025. Let me see which tool to use here.

Looking at the available tools, there's "Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-" which retrieves reviews and tips for a specified hotel. The required parameter is hotel_id. But where do I get the hotel_id from? The description says it can be retrieved from "Search Hotels" or "Search Hotels By Coordinates" endpoints. However, the user hasn't provided coordinates, so probably "Search_Hotels" is the way to go first.

Wait, but the user already mentioned the hotel name: Four Seasons Hotel Toronto. So maybe I need to first search for that hotel to get its hotel_id. Let me check the tools again. The "Search_Hotels" requires parameters like search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. But to search for the hotel, maybe I need to use "Search_Hotel_Destination" first to get the dest_id for Toronto?

Alternatively, maybe the "Search_Hotels" can be used with the hotel name. But the parameters for "Search_Hotels" don't include a hotel name; they have parameters like sort_by, price_min, etc. Hmm. The "Search_Hotel_Destination" is for finding locations, so maybe I need to first find the dest_id for Toronto, then use that in "Search_Hotels" to find the specific hotel.

So step 1: Use "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get the dest_id. Wait, no, "Search_Hotel_Destination" is for locations, addresses, cities, etc. Maybe the hotel name isn't a valid query there. Maybe I should search for Toronto first. Let me think.

The user's main goal is to get reviews for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto. So perhaps the hotel_id is needed. To get the hotel_id, I need to first perform a search using "Search_Hotels" or "Search_Hotel_Destination". But "Search_Hotel_Destination" returns latitude and longitude for the search query. Maybe if I search for "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" in "Search_Hotel_Destination", it will return the location details, including dest_id, which can then be used in "Search_Hotels" to find the hotel's hotel_id.

Alternatively, maybe "Search_Hotels" can take parameters that would allow searching by hotel name, but looking at the parameters for "Search_Hotels", there's no direct parameter for hotel name. The parameters include dest_id, which would be obtained from "Search_Hotel_Destination".

So the process would be:

1. Use "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get the dest_id. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe the query should be the city, like Toronto, Canada. But the user specifically mentioned the hotel name, so perhaps the "Search_Hotels" can be used with the hotel name in some way. However, the parameters for "Search_Hotels" don't include a hotel name. Maybe the search_type from "Search_Hotel_Destination" is needed here.

Wait, the "Search_Hotels" requires "search_type" which is retrieved from "Search_Hotel_Destination". So perhaps the correct flow is:

- First, call "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto" to get the dest_id and search_type.
- Then, use that dest_id and search_type in "Search_Hotels" to find the list of hotels, including the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto, which would have a hotel_id.
- Once I have the hotel_id, then call "Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-" with that hotel_id to get the reviews.

But the user specifically mentioned the hotel name, so maybe after getting the list of hotels from "Search_Hotels", I can filter for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and extract its hotel_id. However, since I'm the assistant, I need to make sure I have the correct hotel_id. But since the user is confident about the hotel name, perhaps the first step is to search for the hotel's location (Toronto) to get the dest_id, then search hotels in that destination to find the specific hotel's ID.

But this seems like multiple steps. However, the user's question is about getting reviews, so the assistant needs to first find the hotel_id. Since the user hasn't provided the hotel_id, the assistant must first perform the necessary steps to retrieve it.

So, first, call "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto, Canada" to get the dest_id and search_type. Then, use that dest_id and search_type in "Search_Hotels" to find the hotel. Once the hotel is found, extract the hotel_id and then call "Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-".

But the user mentioned the hotel name, so maybe in the "Search_Hotels" step, the parameters can include filters to find the specific hotel. However, the parameters for "Search_Hotels" don't include a hotel name. They have parameters like categories_filter, price_min, etc. So perhaps the search results will include the hotel name, and the assistant can select the correct one.

But since I'm the assistant, I need to simulate this process. However, in the current setup, each tool call is a separate step. So the user's initial request is to get reviews for the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto. The assistant needs to first find the hotel_id for that hotel.

Therefore, the first tool call should be "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" to get the necessary location details. Wait, but "Search_Hotel_Destination" is for locations, addresses, etc. Maybe the hotel name is considered a location? Or perhaps the query should be "Toronto" to get the city's dest_id, then search hotels in Toronto.

Alternatively, maybe the "Search_Hotels" can be used with the hotel name in some way. But according to the parameters, there's no direct parameter for hotel name. So the correct approach is:

1. Use "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto" to get the dest_id and search_type.
2. Use "Search_Hotels" with the dest_id obtained, along with arrival and departure dates, and other parameters to find the hotel.
3. From the search results, find the hotel_id for Four Seasons Hotel Toronto.
4. Use "Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-" with the hotel_id to retrieve the reviews.

But the user's arrival and departure dates are December 30, 2024, to January 3, 2025. So those dates would be needed in the "Search_Hotels" call. However, the "Search_Hotels" requires arrival_date and departure_date, which the user has provided.

So the steps would be:

First, call "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto" to get the dest_id and search_type.

Then, call "Search_Hotels" with dest_id from the first step, arrival_date "2024-12-30", departure_date "2025-01-03", and other parameters as needed (like adults, room_qty, etc., but the user hasn't specified those, so maybe default values can be used).

In the "Search_Hotels" response, the hotel_id for Four Seasons Hotel Toronto can be found. Then, use that hotel_id in "Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-".

However, the user hasn't provided the number of adults, children, or rooms, but the "Search_Hotels" parameters have defaults (adults=1, room_qty=1). Since the user is asking about reviews, maybe those parameters aren't critical for the search, but the tool requires them. So the assistant can use default values.

So the first tool call is "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto".

But wait, the user mentioned "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto" specifically. Maybe the query should be the hotel name. Let me check the description of "Search_Hotel_Destination": "Find Hotels by their location, address, state, country, etc. This api's response contains the latitude and longitude for the search query." So the query can be a hotel name? Maybe. If the hotel name is a valid location, then the API might return it. However, the primary purpose of this endpoint is to find locations, so perhaps the hotel name isn't a valid query here. It's more for cities, districts, etc.

Therefore, the correct approach is to first find the city's dest_id. So first, call "Search_Hotel_Destination" with query "Toronto, Canada" to get the dest_id for Toronto. Then, use that dest_id in "Search_Hotels" to find the hotel. Once the hotel is found, extract the hotel_id and then get the reviews.

So the first tool call is:

{
  "name": "Search_Hotel_Destination",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "Toronto, Canada"
  }
}

Then, the response would include the dest_id and search_type. Then, the next step would be to call "Search_Hotels" with that dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc. But since the user's question is about reviews, the assistant needs to first get the hotel_id. However, the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle this step-by-step.

But in the current setup, each turn is a single tool call. So the assistant must first make the first tool call, then wait for the response, then
