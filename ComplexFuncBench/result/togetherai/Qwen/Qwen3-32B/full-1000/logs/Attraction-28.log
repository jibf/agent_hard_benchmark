2025-08-14 20:41:17,305 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-28 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me process the information the user asked for. They wanted details about Tokyo Tower after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Tokyo Tower" as the query. That gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details tool. 

The response from Get_Attraction_Details has a lot of info. The user probably wants a concise summary of the key points. Let me check the data: there's a description, additional info, cancellation policy, price, and what's included. I should highlight the main attractions like the VR rides, AR games, and the robot fight. Also, mention the accessibility, cancellation policy, and price. 

Wait, the user might be planning a visit, so they'd want to know about booking, age restrictions, and what's included. The cancellation is free, which is a plus. The price is around $25, which is reasonable. I should also note the additional fees for some attractions and the requirement to be 18 or older or have an adult. 

I need to present this in a friendly, easy-to-read format. Maybe bullet points for features and important notes. Make sure to mention the highlights first, then the practical details. Avoid jargon and keep it natural. Let me structure the response with sections like Overview, Key Features, Booking Info, and Additional Notes. That should cover everything the user needs without overwhelming them.
