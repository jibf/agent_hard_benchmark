Okay, let me process the information the user asked for. They wanted details about the Forbidden City after seeing it on social media. First, I used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Forbidden City" as the query. That gave me the product slug needed for the next step. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug to get comprehensive info.

The response from Get_Attraction_Details includes a lot of useful data: description, price, cancellation policy, what's included and excluded, reviews, and operational details. I need to present this in a user-friendly way. The user might be planning a visit, so highlighting key points like ticket cost, booking requirements, and visitor tips is important. Also, mentioning the cancellation policy and any restrictions (like not being wheelchair accessible) will help them prepare. I should summarize the main attractions and maybe note the positive reviews to reassure them. Making sure to mention the need for a passport and the age requirement is crucial for their planning. Let me structure this information clearly so it's easy to digest.
