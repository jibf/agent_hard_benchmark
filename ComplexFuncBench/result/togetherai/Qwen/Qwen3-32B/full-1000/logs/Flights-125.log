Okay, let's see. The user wants to travel to Miami and Chicago, staying 5 days each, then return to New York. They haven't decided the order and need the cheapest flight around December 24, 2024, with details.

First, I need to figure out the flight paths. Since they're considering two orders: Miami first then Chicago, or Chicago first then Miami. Each would have different legs. 

The user mentioned staying 5 days in each city. So, for a round trip with two stops, the legs would be: New York to first destination (Miami or Chicago), then to the second destination (Chicago or Miami), then back to New York. 

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can help find the cheapest dates around the specified date. The tool requires legs with fromId, toId, and date. However, since the user hasn't decided the order, I need to check both possible routes. 

Wait, but the tool's legs are an array. For a multi-stop flight, each leg is a segment. However, the tool might not handle return trips. Maybe I need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for outbound and then another search for return? Or perhaps the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle it by considering the legs in sequence. 

The user wants the cheapest departure date around Dec 24, 2024. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. So I need to set the legs for both possible itineraries and check which one is cheaper.

First, let's outline both possible routes:

1. New York (NYC) -> Miami (MIA) -> Chicago (CHI) -> New York (NYC)
   Legs:
   - Leg 1: NYC.CITY to MIA.CITY on Dec 24, 2024
   - Leg 2: MIA.CITY to CHI.CITY on Dec 29, 2024 (after 5 days stay)
   - Leg 3: CHI.CITY to NYC.CITY on Jan 8, 2025 (after another 5 days)

2. New York (NYC) -> Chicago (CHI) -> Miami (MIA) -> New York (NYC)
   Legs:
   - Leg 1: NYC.CITY to CHI.CITY on Dec 24, 2024
   - Leg 2: CHI.CITY to MIA.CITY on Dec 29, 2024
   - Leg 3: MIA.CITY to NYC.CITY on Jan 8, 2025

But the user wants the departure date around Dec 24. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might need all legs' dates. However, since the user is flexible with the order, maybe I should check both routes and see which is cheaper.

But how to handle the return trip? The tool might not account for return flights. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is for multi-stop flights, which can include return trips if structured correctly. However, typically, multi-stop flights are one-way with multiple stops. For a round trip, it's usually two separate searches: outbound and return. But the user wants a single multi-stop flight that includes the return? That might not be standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a round trip with two stops in between. But that's not typical. Usually, multi-stop flights are for one-way trips with multiple stops. For a round trip, you'd have a round trip with possible stops, but the tool might not handle that. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops endpoint's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. The legs are an array of fromId, toId, and date. So each leg is a one-way flight. So for a round trip, you'd need to have two separate searches: one for the outbound multi-stop and another for the return. But the user wants a single trip that goes to both cities and returns. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the user is looking for a multi-city trip where they go from New York to Miami, then to Chicago, then back to New York. That's three legs. So the legs array would have three entries. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle that. 

So I need to create two different legs arrays for the two possible itineraries (Miami first or Chicago first) and call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each, then compare the prices. 

But the user hasn't specified the order, so I need to check both possibilities. However, the tool might not allow that in one call. So I need to make two separate calls. 

First, for the itinerary: NYC -> MIA -> CHI -> NYC. The legs would be:

Leg 1: fromId NYC.CITY to MIA.CITY, date Dec 24, 2024
Leg 2: fromId MIA.CITY to CHI.CITY, date Dec 29, 2024 (after 5 days)
Leg 3: fromId CHI.CITY to NYC.CITY, date Jan 8, 2025 (after another 5 days)

Second itinerary: NYC -> CHI -> MIA -> NYC. Legs:

Leg 1: NYC.CITY to CHI.CITY, date Dec 24, 2024
Leg 2: CHI.CITY to MIA.CITY, date Dec 29, 2024
Leg 3: MIA.CITY to NYC.CITY, date Jan 8, 2025

I need to call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for both itineraries and see which one is cheaper. However, the tool's legs parameter is an array of legs. So I can structure each itinerary as a separate call. 

But the user wants the departure date around Dec 24. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will look for the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, but in the legs, the dates are fixed. Or does the tool adjust the dates within the 5-day window? The description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So perhaps the query date is the initial date, and the tool adjusts the dates of the legs accordingly. But the example given in the tool's parameters shows legs with specific dates. 

This is a bit unclear. Maybe the tool requires the legs to have specific dates, and it will find the minimum price for those exact legs, but considering dates within 5 days before and after the query date. Or maybe the query date is the departure date, and the tool adjusts the legs' dates. 

The tool's parameters don't have a query date parameter, only the legs with dates. So perhaps the legs' dates are fixed, and the tool finds the minimum price for those exact legs. But the description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. Maybe the query date is the first leg's date, and the tool adjusts the first leg's date within the 5-day window. 

This is confusing. Let me re-read the tool's description. 

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool's description says: "Get the minimum price for multi-stop flights. This API will return the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date." 

Wait, but the parameters don't include a query date. The parameters are legs (array of fromId, toId, date) and cabinClass. So perhaps the "query date" refers to the first leg's date, and the tool adjusts the first leg's date within 5 days before and after that date. But the example in the parameters shows legs with specific dates. 

This is unclear. Maybe the tool is intended to find the minimum price for the given legs, but allowing the first leg's date to vary within 5 days before and after the specified date. However, the parameters don't have a separate query date. 

Alternatively, maybe the tool is supposed to take the legs' dates as fixed, and the "query date" is a typo or misstatement. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the legs as specified, using the dates the user mentioned (Dec 24, 2024 for the first leg, then adding 5 days for the next legs). Then, call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for both itineraries and see which is cheaper. 

So first, for the first itinerary (NYC -> MIA -> CHI -> NYC), the legs would be:

[
  { "fromId": "NYC.CITY", "toId": "MIA.CITY", "date": "2024-12-24" },
  { "fromId": "MIA.CITY", "toId": "CHI.CITY", "date": "2024-12-29" },
  { "fromId": "CHI.CITY", "toId": "NYC.CITY", "date": "2025-01-08" }
]

Second itinerary (NYC -> CHI -> MIA -> NYC):

[
  { "fromId": "NYC.CITY", "toId": "CHI.CITY", "date": "2024-12-24" },
  { "fromId": "CHI.CITY", "toId": "MIA.CITY", "date": "
