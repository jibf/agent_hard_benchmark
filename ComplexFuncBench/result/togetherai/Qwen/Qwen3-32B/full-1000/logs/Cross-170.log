Okay, let me break down how I arrived at the answer. The user asked for attractions near the Pudong Shangri-La hotel in Shanghai, specifically the Oriental Pearl Tower. 

First, I used the hotel_id provided (181422) to call the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool. This gave me the closest landmarks, including the Oriental Pearl Tower with its details like distance and ratings.

Next, to get more info on the Oriental Pearl Tower, I needed to use the Search_Attraction_Location tool with the query "Oriental Pearl Tower". This step was necessary to retrieve the productSlug, which is required for the Get_Attraction_Details tool. 

Once I had the productSlug from the search results, I called Get_Attraction_Details. This provided comprehensive information about the tower, including its description, ticket prices, opening hours, and included attractions. 

I made sure to present the information clearly, highlighting key points like the tower's features, ticket details, and practical information such as cancellation policies and accessibility. This structured approach ensures the user gets all the necessary details to plan their visit effectively.
