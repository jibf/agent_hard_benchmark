Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, the user wants their friend to travel from Beijing to New York around November 15, 2024, with a layover in Paris. The key points here are the multi-stop flight with a layover in Paris, the departure date around November 15, and the requirement that there are no overnight layovers. Additionally, they need the cheapest multi-stop flight's departure dates and the seat map for that flight.

First, I need to figure out the correct airport IDs for Beijing, Paris, and New York. The user mentioned using the Search_Flight_Location tool to get these IDs. So, I'll need to call that tool for each city. For example, searching for Beijing's airport ID, then Paris, then New York. Once I have those IDs, I can proceed to find the flights.

Next, using the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool. The user wants the cheapest flights, so this tool is appropriate. The legs would be Beijing to Paris, then Paris to New York. The dates need to be around November 15, but the tool's description says it looks for the lowest prices within 5 days before and after the query date. So, I should set the date for each leg as November 15, 2024. However, I need to ensure that the layover in Paris isn't overnight. The tool might not directly handle layover duration, so maybe the results will include flights with layovers that meet the criteria, but I might need to filter those results manually. But since the user is asking for the cheapest, the tool should return options that fit the date and layover constraints.

After getting the minimum price and flight details, the next step is to retrieve the seat map. For that, the Get_Seat_Map tool requires an offerToken, which is obtained from either Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Since the user is looking for multi-stop flights, I should use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool to get the offerToken. Wait, but the user already used Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. However, the offerToken might be from the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops response. So perhaps I need to first use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken, then use that to get the seat map. But the user's initial request was to get the cheapest multi-stop flight's departure dates, which the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool is designed for. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not provide the offerToken directly. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops gives the lowest price, but to get the seat map, I need the offerToken from either Search_Flights or Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. So maybe after finding the cheapest flight using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same parameters to get the offerToken for the specific flight, then use that to get the seat map. But that might require multiple steps.

Wait, the user's first step is to find the cheapest multi-stop flight's departure dates. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool is designed for that. Once we have the flight details from that tool, we can then use the offerToken from that result to get the seat map. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool's response might not include the offerToken. The offerToken is usually from the searchFlights or searchFlightsMultiStops endpoints. So perhaps the correct approach is to first use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight options, including the offerToken, then use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest one, and then use the offerToken from the cheapest flight to get the seat map. But the user's query is to first get the cheapest multi-stop flight's departure dates, which the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can provide. However, without the offerToken, we can't get the seat map. Therefore, maybe the process is: 1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the IDs for Beijing, Paris, and New York. 2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flights with the given legs and dates. 3. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same parameters to get the offerToken for the specific flight. 4. Finally, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken. But the user might not want to do step 3 if they already have the cheapest flight from step 2. However, the offerToken is necessary for the seat map. So perhaps the correct flow is to first get the IDs, then use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flight's details (including the offerToken?), but if that tool doesn't provide the offerToken, then we need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the tool descriptions again.

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. The parameters include legs, cabinClass, etc. The response from this tool would include the flight details, but does it include the offerToken? The offerToken is mentioned as being from the searchFlights or searchFlightsMultiStops endpoints. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is a different endpoint, so maybe it doesn't return the offerToken. Therefore, after finding the cheapest flight using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, we would need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs and dates to get the offerToken for that specific flight. But that might require knowing the exact dates and other parameters. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops returns the offerToken, but the tool's description doesn't specify. Since the user's instruction is to get the seat map, which requires the offerToken, we need to ensure that we can obtain it. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to first get the IDs, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight options, including the offerToken, then select the cheapest one (which might be the same as Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops), and then use the offerToken to get the seat map. However, the user specifically mentioned using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest, so maybe that's the first step. Let's proceed step by step.

First, call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing, Paris, and New York to get their IDs. Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs as Beijing to Paris on Nov 15, then Paris to New York on Nov 15 (or adjusted dates within the 5-day window). The cabinClass can be ECONOMY unless specified, but the user didn't mention, so default to ECONOMY. The response from Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops will give the cheapest flights, including the dates. Then, once we have the flight details, we need the offerToken to get the seat map. But since Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not provide the offerToken, we need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same parameters to get the offerToken. However, the user might not have specified the exact dates yet, so after getting the cheapest dates from Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, we can then use those exact dates in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the offerToken. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with that offerToken.

But the user's query is to first get the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight and then get the seat map. So the first step is to find the dates, then the seat map. Therefore, the process is:

1. Search for airport IDs for Beijing, Paris, New York.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest flight with legs Beijing->Paris->New York around Nov 15, ensuring no overnight layovers.
3. Once the cheapest flight's dates are determined, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those exact dates to get the offerToken.
4. Use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken to retrieve the seat map.

But the user might not want to do step 3 if they can get the offerToken directly from step 2. However, based on the tool descriptions, Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return the offerToken. Therefore, the correct approach is to first get the IDs, then use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest dates, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with those dates to get the offerToken, and then get the seat map.

Now, considering the user's requirement that there are no overnight layovers. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool might not filter by layover duration, so the results might include flights with overnight layovers. Therefore, after retrieving the cheapest flights, we need to check if the layover in Paris is during the day. However, the tool's parameters don't include layover duration, so this might require filtering the results manually. But since the user is asking for the cheapest, perhaps the tool's results will include flights that meet the no overnight layover condition. Alternatively, the user might need to specify that in the query, but the tool's parameters don't allow for that. This is a potential issue. The user might need to manually check the layover times, but since we can't do that in the tool call, we have to proceed with the available parameters.

So, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. Let's start with Beijing. The query for Search_Flight_Location would be "
