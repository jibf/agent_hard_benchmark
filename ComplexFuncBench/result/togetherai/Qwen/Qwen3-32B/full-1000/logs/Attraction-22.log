2025-08-14 20:40:25,475 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-22 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me process the user's request step by step. The user initially asked about the Etihad Stadium after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool to find relevant products related to the stadium. The response included several tours, and the first one listed was the 75-minute Etihad Stadium Guided Tour with a product slug. 

Next, I called the Get_Attraction_Details tool using that slug to get more detailed information. The response provided a comprehensive overview of the tour, including the description, what's included, pricing, cancellation policy, and reviews. 

Now, I need to present this information in a user-friendly way. The user probably wants to know the key highlights of the tour, the cost, any important policies like cancellation, and maybe the reviews. I should structure the answer to cover these points clearly. Also, since the user mentioned they found the stadium on social media, they might be interested in visiting soon, so highlighting the booking details and any requirements (like arriving 20 minutes early) would be helpful.

I should check if there's any missing information or if the user might have follow-up questions. For example, they might want to know how to book or if there are different tour options. Since the response mentions it's bookable and operated by Klook, I can mention that. Also, the cancellation policy is free, which is a positive point to highlight.

I need to ensure the answer is concise but covers all essential details without overwhelming the user. Using bullet points or sections for each key area (description, price, cancellation, etc.) would make it easy to read. Finally, I should invite the user to ask more questions if they need further details.
