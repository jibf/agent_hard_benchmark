Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Reservation Hotel in Dubai with hotel_id 7181225. First, I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool with the hotel_id. It returned Dubai Sports City as a close landmark. Then, to get more details about that attraction, I called Search_Attraction_Location with "Dubai Sports City" as the query. That gave me a productSlug, which I used in the Get_Attraction_Details tool. The result was a detailed description of the Private Water Sports Activity. Now, I need to present this information clearly.

The user probably wants a recommendation with specifics. They might be looking for things to do nearby, so highlighting the water sports activity makes sense. I should mention the distance from the hotel, the rating, and the key details from the attraction's description. Also, important info like age restrictions, what's included, and cancellation policy should be noted. Make sure it's easy to read and answers their query fully.
