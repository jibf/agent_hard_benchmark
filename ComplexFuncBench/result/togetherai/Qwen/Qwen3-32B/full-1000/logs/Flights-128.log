2025-08-14 22:46:12,914 - evaluation_logger_Flights-128 - INFO - Query: I plan to go to Dallas and Houston, staying 6 days in each place, and then return to Miami. I haven't decided whether to go to Dallas first or Houston first. Please help me find the departure date of the cheapest flight around November 25th, 2024, and provide the detailed information for that flight.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to travel to Dallas and Houston, spend 6 days in each, and return to Miami. They haven't decided the order, so I need to consider both possibilities: Dallas first then Houston, or Houston first then Dallas. The goal is to find the cheapest flight around November 25, 2024, and get detailed info.

First, I need to get the location IDs for Dallas, Houston, and Miami airports. The user mentioned cities, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool for each. For example, querying "Dallas" to get the airport ID, same for Houston and Miami. Let me check the parameters for that toolâ€”it requires a query string. So I'll call it three times with each city name.

Once I have the IDs, say DFW for Dallas, IAH for Houston, and MIA for Miami, I need to plan the flight legs. Since the order isn't decided, I'll have to create two scenarios. First scenario: Dallas first. The legs would be MIA to DFW on Nov 25, DFW to IAH after 6 days (Dec 1), and IAH to MIA after another 6 days (Dec 7). Second scenario: Houston first. Legs would be MIA to IAH on Nov 25, IAH to DFW on Dec 1, DFW to MIA on Dec 7. 

But the user wants the cheapest flight around Nov 25. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can find the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. So I should use that tool with both scenarios. However, the tool requires legs array. I'll need to structure the legs for each possible route. Wait, but the user hasn't decided the order, so maybe I should check both possibilities. However, the tool might not handle multiple scenarios at once. Maybe I need to make two separate calls for each possible route. But the user might not know which is cheaper, so I need to check both and compare.

Alternatively, maybe the user is open to either order, so I should find the cheapest between the two options. But how to do that with the available tools? The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can take multiple legs. Let me check the parameters again. The legs array must contain fromId, toId, and date. The date is for the departure. So for the first scenario (Dallas first), the legs would be:

Leg 1: MIA to DFW on 2024-11-25
Leg 2: DFW to IAH on 2024-12-01 (6 days later)
Leg 3: IAH to MIA on 2024-12-07 (another 6 days)

For the second scenario (Houston first):

Leg 1: MIA to IAH on 2024-11-25
Leg 2: IAH to DFW on 2024-12-01
Leg 3: DFW to MIA on 2024-12-07

So I need to call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops twice, once for each leg sequence. But the user wants the cheapest overall. However, the tool's description says it returns the lowest price within 5 days before and after the query date. Wait, the query date is the date in the legs. So if the user specifies Nov 25, the tool will look for flights departing on Nov 20-30 (assuming 5 days before and after). But the user wants the departure date around Nov 25, so the legs' dates should be set to Nov 25, and the tool will find the cheapest within that window. But the return legs would be fixed based on the 6-day stay. Wait, maybe the user is flexible on the exact dates as long as the initial departure is around Nov 25. The tool's legs require specific dates, but the user might want to find the cheapest possible dates within a 5-day window. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The tool's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user's query date is Nov 25, the tool will check flights departing on Nov 20-30. But the user wants to stay 6 days in each city, so the return legs would be 6 days after each leg. For example, if the first leg is on Nov 25, the second leg would be on Dec 1, and the third on Dec 7. But if the first leg is on Nov 20, the second would be Nov 26, and third on Dec 2. However, the user's main concern is the departure date around Nov 25, so maybe the first leg's date is Nov 25, and the tool will find the cheapest within that window. 

So first, I need to get the location IDs for Dallas, Houston, and Miami. Then, create two leg sequences (Dallas first and Houston first) with the first leg departing on Nov 25. Then call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each sequence. The tool will return the minimum price for each scenario, and then I can compare which is cheaper. 

But the user hasn't specified the order, so I need to check both possibilities. However, the user might not want to pay for two separate API calls. But according to the tools provided, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is the right tool here. So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Dallas, Houston, Miami to get their airport IDs.
2. For each city, get the fromId and toId.
3. Create two leg arrays: one for Dallas first, another for Houston first.
4. Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each leg array, with the first leg's date as 2024-11-25.
5. Compare the results to find the cheapest option.
6. Once the cheapest legs are found, use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info using the token from the search.

Wait, but the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops doesn't return a token. The tool's description says it returns the lowest priced flights. But to get detailed info, the user might need to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops first to get a token, then Get_Flight_Details. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the approach. Let me check the tools again.

The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool's endpoint is /api/v1/flights/getMinPriceMultiStops. The description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. But the parameters require legs with dates. So if the user's query date is Nov 25, the tool will look for flights departing on Nov 20-30. But the user wants to stay 6 days in each city, so the return legs would be 6 days after each leg. However, the tool's legs require specific dates. So perhaps the user is flexible on the exact dates, and the tool will find the cheapest combination within the 5-day window for each leg. But the user's main constraint is the initial departure around Nov 25. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the entire trip to start around Nov 25, so the first leg's date is Nov 25, and the subsequent legs are 6 days later. But the tool's legs require specific dates. So the user's initial request is to find the departure date of the cheapest flight around Nov 25, so the first leg's date is Nov 25, and the tool will find the cheapest within that window. 

So the steps are:

1. Get the airport IDs for Dallas, Houston, Miami.
2. Create two leg sequences (Dallas first and Houston first) with the first leg on Nov 25, second on Dec 1, third on Dec 7.
3. Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each sequence.
4. Compare the prices and choose the cheaper one.
5. Then, use Get_Flight_Details to get more info, but that requires a token from Search_Flights_Multi_Stops. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return a token. So perhaps after finding the cheapest legs, I need to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs to get the token, then use Get_Flight_Details. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me outline the necessary tool calls:

First, get the location IDs:

- Search_Flight_Location for Dallas
- Search_Flight_Location for Houston
- Search_Flight_Location for Miami

Assuming each returns an ID like DFW.AIRPORT, IAH.AIRPORT, MIA.AIRPORT.

Then, create two leg arrays:

Option 1: MIA to DFW (Nov 25), DFW to IAH (Dec 1), IAH to MIA (Dec 7)

Option 2: MIA to IAH (Nov 25), IAH to DFW (Dec 1), DFW to MIA (Dec 7)

Call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each option. The tool will return the minimum price for each. Then, compare the two options and pick the cheaper one. Once the cheapest is found, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs to get the token, then Get_Flight_Details to retrieve the detailed info.

But the user's question is to find the departure date of the cheapest flight around Nov 25 and provide detailed info. So
