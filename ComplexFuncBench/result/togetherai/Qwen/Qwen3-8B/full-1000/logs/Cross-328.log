Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They need to find the cheapest connecting flights from Denver to Pittsburgh and then to USC, with car rentals at each destination. First, I need to figure out the flight details.

The user is leaving Denver on November 18th, 2024. They have to go to the University of Pittsburgh first, then USC. Each stay is five days, so the flight to Pittsburgh should be on the 18th, and the return flight from Pittsburgh would be on the 23rd. Then, from Pittsburgh to USC on the 23rd, staying until the 28th, and leaving USC on the 28th. Wait, but the user mentions giving speeches at each university, so maybe the flights are one-way? Wait, the user says they're leaving Denver on the 18th, then staying in each city for five days. So the first flight is Denver to Pittsburgh on 18th, then Pittsburgh to USC on the 23rd (after five days in Pittsburgh). Then, they need to leave USC on the 28th. But the user hasn't mentioned a return flight from USC. Wait, maybe they need to return from USC to Denver on the 28th? Or is the trip one-way? The user's message isn't clear on that. But since they mention "leaving Denver" and "stay in each city for five days," perhaps they need to return from USC to Denver. But the user might have only mentioned the outbound flights. Hmm, maybe I should assume they need to return from USC on the 28th. But the user's query says "Find the cheapest connecting flights for me," so maybe it's a round trip? Or maybe it's a multi-leg journey with two legs: Denver to Pittsburgh, then Pittsburgh to USC. But the user might need to return from USC. However, the user hasn't specified a return date. Wait, the original query says they are leaving Denver on November 18th, giving speeches at Pittsburgh and USC in sequence, and staying in each city for five days. So the timeline would be:

- Depart Denver on 18th (arrive in Pittsburgh)
- Stay in Pittsburgh until 23rd (5 days)
- Depart Pittsburgh on 23rd (arrive in USC)
- Stay in USC until 28th (5 days)
- Then, they need to return from USC on 28th back to Denver? Or is the trip only to USC? The user's message isn't clear on the return. But since they mentioned "leaving Denver" and "stay in each city," maybe they need to return from USC. However, the user hasn't specified a return date. But the problem says "cheapest connecting flights," which might imply round trip. But the user might have only mentioned the outbound. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the user's main request is for connecting flights from Denver to Pittsburgh and then to USC, with car rentals at each destination. So perhaps the flights are one-way, but the user might need to return. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should focus on the outbound legs. Alternatively, maybe the user is going to Pittsburgh and USC and then returning. But without a return date, it's hard to say. However, the user's query says "I'll stay in each city for five days," so the first flight is on 18th, then the next flight is 5 days later (23rd) from Pittsburgh to USC, and then the return flight from USC would be on the 28th. But the user hasn't mentioned a return flight. Maybe the user is only going to USC and needs to return. But the original query is a bit unclear. However, the user's main request is to find the cheapest connecting flights for the journey from Denver to Pittsburgh to USC, with car rentals at each destination. So the flights are two legs: Denver to Pittsburgh on 18th, then Pittsburgh to USC on 23rd. Then, the user needs to rent a car in Pittsburgh upon arrival and return it before the next flight, and similarly in USC. 

So first, I need to find the flight from Denver to Pittsburgh on 18th. Then, from Pittsburgh to USC on 23rd. But to get the flight details, I need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airport IDs for Denver and Pittsburgh, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the multi-leg journey. Wait, but the user is going from Denver to Pittsburgh (first leg), then Pittsburgh to USC (second leg). So the legs array would have two entries. But the user is leaving Denver on 18th, so the first leg is from Denver to Pittsburgh on 18th. Then, the second leg is from Pittsburgh to USC on 23rd. But the user needs to stay in each city for five days, so the first flight arrives in Pittsburgh on 18th, stays until 23rd, then departs on 23rd. Then arrives in USC on 23rd, stays until 28th, then departs on 28th. But the user hasn't mentioned a return flight. However, the user might need to return from USC on 28th. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the user is only going to USC and needs to return. But the original query is unclear. However, the user's main request is to find the cheapest connecting flights for the journey from Denver to Pittsburgh to USC, so perhaps the flights are one-way. But the user might need to return. However, without a return date, it's hard to proceed. But the user's message says "I'm leaving Denver on November 18th, to give speeches at University of Pittsburgh and USC in sequence. I'll stay in each city for five days." So the trip is from Denver to Pittsburgh (18th), then Pittsburgh to USC (23rd), then USC to Denver (28th). But the user hasn't mentioned the return flight. However, the user might need to return from USC on the 28th. But the user's query is about finding the cheapest connecting flights, which could be a round trip. But the user hasn't specified the return date. This is a bit of a problem. However, given the information, I'll proceed with the outbound legs: Denver to Pittsburgh on 18th, then Pittsburgh to USC on 23rd. Then, the user needs to rent a car in each destination. 

So first, I need to find the airport IDs for Denver and Pittsburgh. The user is leaving Denver, so the fromId for the first leg is Denver's airport ID. The toId for the first leg is Pittsburgh's airport ID. Then, the second leg's fromId is Pittsburgh's airport ID, and toId is USC's airport ID. But USC is in Los Angeles, so the destination for the second leg is Los Angeles. Wait, the user says "University of Pittsburgh" (Pittsburgh, PA) and "USC" (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). So the first leg is Denver to Pittsburgh (PA), then Pittsburgh to Los Angeles (USC). 

So first, I need to use Search_Flight_Location to find the airport IDs for Denver, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles. 

For the first leg: fromId is Denver's airport ID, toId is Pittsburgh's airport ID, date is 2024-11-18. 

For the second leg: fromId is Pittsburgh's airport ID, toId is Los Angeles's airport ID, date is 2024-11-23. 

Then, the user needs to rent a car in each destination. For each destination (Pittsburgh and Los Angeles), they need to rent a car. The user picks up the car one hour after landing and returns it two hours before the next flight. 

So for the first leg (Denver to Pittsburgh), the user arrives in Pittsburgh on 18th, picks up the car one hour after landing. The flight arrives in Pittsburgh on 18th, so the pick-up time would be, say, 15:00 (if the flight lands at 14:00). Then, the car is returned two hours before the next flight (from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles on 23rd). Wait, the next flight is on 23rd, so the user needs to return the car in Pittsburgh two hours before the departure date. Wait, the user is staying in Pittsburgh for five days, so the flight from Pittsburgh to USC is on the 23rd. So the user arrives in Pittsburgh on 18th, stays until 23rd, then departs on 23rd. So the car rental in Pittsburgh would be from the arrival time (after landing) on 18th, and returned two hours before the departure flight on 23rd. Similarly, in Los Angeles, the user arrives on 23rd, picks up the car one hour after landing, and returns it two hours before the departure flight (if there's a return flight). But the user hasn't mentioned a return flight. However, the user might need to return from USC on 28th. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the car rental in Los Angeles is only for the stay until 28th, but the user's flight from USC is on 28th. So the user would need to return the car in Los Angeles two hours before the departure flight on 28th. 

But the user's query is about finding the cheapest connecting flights and car rentals. So the steps are:

1. Find the airport IDs for Denver,
