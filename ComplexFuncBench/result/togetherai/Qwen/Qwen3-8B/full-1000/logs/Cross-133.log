Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want the fastest plane tickets from Montreal to Miami on November 20, 2024, and then from Miami to Orlando on November 22, 2024. They also need hotels near the airports in Miami and Orlando, within 30 km of the arrival airports.

Starting with the flights. The user mentioned "fastest" so I should use the Search_Flights endpoint with sort parameter set to FASTEST. But first, I need the airport IDs for Montreal and Miami. Wait, the Search_Flights requires fromId and toId, which are airport IDs. So I need to find the airport IDs for Montreal (departure) and Miami (arrival for the first leg). Then, for the return trip, Miami to Orlando, I need the airport ID for Orlando. 

Wait, the user is going from Montreal to Miami on Nov 20, then Miami to Orlando on Nov 22. So first, I need to get the airport IDs for Montreal (fromId), Miami (toId for the first flight), and Orlando (toId for the second flight). But how do I get those airport IDs? The Search_Flight_Location endpoint can be used with the query parameter as the city names. So I should call Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando to get their airport IDs.

Once I have the airport IDs, I can use Search_Flights for each leg. For the first flight, from Montreal to Miami on Nov 20, sort by FASTEST. Then for the second flight, Miami to Orlando on Nov 22, also sorted by FASTEST. But wait, the user might need the return flight details, but the second flight is from Miami to Orlando, so maybe the return date isn't needed here. Wait, the user says they're staying in Miami and Orlando for two days each. So the first flight is Montreal to Miami on Nov 20, then Miami to Orlando on Nov 22. So the first flight is one-way, and the second is another one-way. 

Once the flight details are obtained, the user wants to book them separately. But the user hasn't mentioned return flights yet. Wait, the user says they're staying in Miami and Orlando for two days each. So maybe they need a return flight from Orlando back to Montreal? But the user hasn't specified that. The initial request is to check the fastest tickets for the two legs: Montreal to Miami on Nov 20, and Miami to Orlando on Nov 22. So maybe the user is planning a trip that starts in Montreal, goes to Miami, then to Orlando, and then maybe returns? But the user hasn't mentioned the return trip. So perhaps the user just needs the two one-way flights. 

But the user also wants to book them separately in case plans change. So the user might need the details for each flight to book them individually. 

Next, after getting the flight details, the user needs hotels within 30 km of the arrival airports. For the first flight, arrival is Miami airport, so need to find hotels near Miami airport. For the second flight, arrival is Orlando airport, so hotels near Orlando airport. 

To get the hotel details, the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates endpoint requires latitude and longitude of the airport. But the user hasn't provided those. So I need to get the latitude and longitude of the airports. Wait, the Location_to_Lat_Long endpoint can be used to get the coordinates of the airport locations. But the airport names might not be precise. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location endpoint returns the airport's coordinates? Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint's description says it finds airports by location, address, etc., but the parameters are a query string. So perhaps using that endpoint with the airport names (Montreal, Miami, Orlando) to get their airport IDs and then their coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe the airport's coordinates can be retrieved via the Location_to_Lat_Long endpoint by querying the airport's name. For example, querying "Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport" to get its coordinates. But the user might not have the exact names. However, the user mentioned "arrival airports of the flights," so for the first flight, arrival is Miami, so the airport is Miami International Airport. Similarly, for the second flight, arrival is Orlando, so Orlando International Airport. 

So steps:

1. For each flight leg, get the airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location with the city names (Montreal, Miami, Orlando). 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint's parameters are a query string, which can be the airport name, city, etc. So for Montreal, query "Montreal" to get the airport ID. Similarly for Miami and Orlando. 

Once I have the airport IDs, then use Search_Flights for each leg. 

But the user wants the fastest flights, so for each flight, set sort to FASTEST. 

Once the flight details are obtained, the user needs hotel info near the arrival airports. 

For that, need the latitude and longitude of the arrival airports. So for Miami International Airport, get its coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami International Airport". Similarly for Orlando International Airport. 

Then, use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date as the flight's arrival date (Nov 20 for Miami, Nov 22 for Orlando), departure_date as the day after (since they stay two days each), radius 30 km, and the coordinates of the airports. 

But the user hasn't specified the exact arrival and departure dates for the hotels. Wait, the user says they're staying in Miami and Orlando for two days each. So for the first leg, arrival in Miami on Nov 20, then stay two days, so departure from Miami would be Nov 22. Then flight from Miami to Orlando on Nov 22, arriving in Orlando, then stay two days, departing on Nov 24. 

But the user hasn't mentioned the return flight. So the hotels in Miami would be for arrival on Nov 20, departure on Nov 22. Hotels in Orlando would be arrival on Nov 22, departure on Nov 24. 

So for the first hotel search (Miami), arrival_date is 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22. For Orlando, arrival_date 2024-11-22, departure_date 2024-11-24. 

But the user might need to adjust based on actual flight times. However, since the user hasn't provided exact flight times, we'll proceed with the dates as per the flight days. 

So the plan is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get airport IDs for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando.

2. Use Search_Flights for Montreal to Miami on 2024-11-20, sorted by FASTEST.

3. Use Search_Flights for Miami to Orlando on 2024-11-22, sorted by FASTEST.

4. For each arrival airport (Miami and Orlando), get their coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long.

5. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Miami with arrival_date 2024-11-20, departure_date 2024-11-22, radius 30 km, and the coordinates.

6. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Orlando with arrival_date 2024-11-22, departure_date 2024-11-24, radius 30 km, and the coordinates.

But the user might need the hotel details based on the actual arrival airports of the flights. So the first flight arrives in Miami, so the hotel is near Miami airport. The second flight arrives in Orlando, so hotel near Orlando airport. 

Now, the user might need the flight details first to get the exact arrival airports, but since the user specified the destinations, we can assume the arrival airports are Miami and Orlando. 

But to be precise, the Search_Flights might return specific airports, but the user has specified the cities, so we can proceed with the city names. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando to get their airport IDs. Then use those IDs in Search_Flights. 

But the user might not have provided the exact airport names, so the Search_Flight_Location might return multiple airports. However, the user is likely referring to the main airports. 

So the first step is to get the airport IDs for each city. Then proceed with the flight searches. 

Once the flight details are obtained, the next step is to get the coordinates of the arrival airports (Miami and Orlando) to find nearby hotels. 

So the initial tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, and Orlando to get their airport IDs.

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so the query parameter for Search_Flight_Location would be "Montreal", "Miami", "Orlando". 

Then, using those IDs in Search_Flights. 

After that, get the coordinates of the arrival airports (Miami and Orlando) via Location_to_Lat_Long. 

Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the respective dates. 

So the first tool calls are:

- Search_Flight_Location for Montreal, Miami, Orlando.

But the user might need to call these three endpoints. 

But the user's initial request is to check the fastest tickets and hotels. So the assistant needs to make these calls step by step. 

But since the user hasn't provided the exact airport IDs, the assistant must first retrieve them. 

So the
