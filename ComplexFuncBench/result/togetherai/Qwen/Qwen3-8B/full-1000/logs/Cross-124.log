Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want the best-priced interlining flight around December 1, 2024, starting from Detroit with stops in Chicago and Dallas, then to Denver. They also need affordable hotel recommendations for Chicago and Dallas, staying a week each.

First, I need to break down the flight part. The user mentioned an interlining flight with specific stops. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool seems appropriate here. The legs parameter requires fromId, toId, and date. But wait, the user mentioned stops in Chicago and Dallas before Denver. So the legs would be Detroit to Chicago, Chicago to Dallas, Dallas to Denver. But the departure date is around December 1, so maybe the first leg is on Dec 1, then subsequent legs a day after each stop? The user says "around December 1," so maybe the first flight is on Dec 1, then the next day from Chicago to Dallas, and then Dallas to Denver. But the exact dates might need to be adjusted. However, the tool requires the date for each leg. So I'll need to structure the legs accordingly.

Next, for the flight, I need the fromId and toId for each city. The Search_Flight_Location tool can get those IDs based on the city names. So first, I should call Search_Flight_Location for Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, and Denver to get their IDs. Then use those IDs in the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool.

Once the flight details are sorted, the user needs hotel recommendations for Chicago and Dallas. The Search_Hotel_Destination tool can find hotel locations, and then Search_Hotels can get the best-priced options. But the user wants the most affordable, so sorting by price might be necessary. Also, they'll be staying a week in each city, so the check-in and check-out dates would be for each city. For example, in Chicago, arrival on Dec 1, departure on Dec 8, then Dallas from Dec 8 to Dec 15, and Denver from Dec 15 onwards. Wait, but the user says they'll stay a week in each city. So maybe the first leg is Detroit to Chicago on Dec 1, stay until Dec 8, then Chicago to Dallas on Dec 8, stay until Dec 15, then Dallas to Denver on Dec 15, and stay there until Dec 22. But the user might need hotels for Chicago and Dallas, so the hotel search for Chicago would be for dates Dec 1 to Dec 8, and Dallas for Dec 8 to Dec 15. However, the user might not have specified the exact dates for hotels, just the cities. So maybe the hotel search for each city would be for a week, but the exact dates depend on the flight schedule. Since the flight dates are around Dec 1, the hotels would be for the duration of the stay in each city. But the user hasn't provided exact dates for the hotels, just the cities. So perhaps the hotels are for a week each, so the arrival and departure dates for each city would be adjusted accordingly. However, the user might need the hotels to be available for the entire week, so the search parameters would need to include the check-in and check-out dates. But since the flight dates are not fully specified, maybe the user is looking for the best prices in those cities, regardless of specific dates, but the hotels would be for a week. Alternatively, the user might need the hotels for the duration of their stay, which is a week in each city. So the hotel search for Chicago would be for a week starting from the arrival date (Dec 1) and departing on Dec 8, and Dallas from Dec 8 to Dec 15. But the user hasn't specified the exact dates, so maybe the hotels are for a week each, so the search would need to include the check-in and check-out dates. However, the user might not have provided the exact dates, so perhaps the hotels are for a week, and the dates are inferred from the flight schedule. But since the flight dates are not fully specified, maybe the user is looking for the best prices in those cities, and the hotels would be for a week. So the Search_Hotel_Destination would be called for Chicago and Dallas to get their dest_id, then Search_Hotels with the appropriate dates and parameters.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location for Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Denver to get their IDs.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs: Detroit to Chicago on Dec 1, Chicago to Dallas on Dec 2, Dallas to Denver on Dec 3 (assuming stops are consecutive days). Wait, the user said "around December 1," so maybe the first leg is on Dec 1, then the next leg a day after, etc. But the exact dates might need to be adjusted. However, the tool requires the date for each leg. So the legs would be:

Leg 1: fromId (Detroit), toId (Chicago), date: 2024-12-01
Leg 2: fromId (Chicago), toId (Dallas), date: 2024-12-02
Leg 3: fromId (Dallas), toId (Denver), date: 2024-12-03

But the user might have a different schedule, but since they mentioned "around December 1," this is a possible approach.

3. Once the flight details are obtained, then proceed to hotels.

For hotels in Chicago and Dallas:

4. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for Chicago and Dallas to get their dest_id.
5. Use Search_Hotels for each city with the appropriate dates. For Chicago, arrival date would be Dec 1, departure Dec 8 (a week). For Dallas, arrival Dec 8, departure Dec 15. But the user might need the hotels to be available for the entire week, so the dates would be set accordingly. The parameters for Search_Hotels would include arrival_date, departure_date, dest_id, and sort_by price.

But the user wants the most affordable, so sort_by price. Also, the user might need to specify the number of adults and rooms, but since it's not mentioned, default values can be used (adults=1, room_qty=1). However, the user might need to adjust based on their group size, but since it's not specified, we'll proceed with defaults.

So the steps are:

First, get the flight IDs for each city via Search_Flight_Location.

Then, use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs as described.

Then, for each city (Chicago and Dallas), get their dest_id via Search_Hotel_Destination, then use Search_Hotels with the respective dates and sort by price.

But the user might need the hotels for a week each, so the dates for Chicago would be arrival on Dec 1, departure on Dec 8, and for Dallas arrival on Dec 8, departure on Dec 15. However, the exact dates depend on the flight schedule. Since the flight from Dallas to Denver is on Dec 3, the user would arrive in Dallas on Dec 2 (assuming the flight from Chicago to Dallas is on Dec 2), then stay until Dec 8. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the user's itinerary is:

- Depart Detroit on Dec 1 to Chicago.
- Stay in Chicago from Dec 1 to Dec 8.
- Fly from Chicago to Dallas on Dec 8.
- Stay in Dallas from Dec 8 to Dec 15.
- Fly from Dallas to Denver on Dec 15.
- Stay in Denver from Dec 15 onwards.

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates, just the cities. So the hotel dates for Chicago would be arrival on Dec 1, departure on Dec 8. For Dallas, arrival on Dec 8, departure on Dec 15. So the Search_Hotels for Chicago would have arrival_date: 2024-12-01, departure_date: 2024-12-08, and for Dallas arrival_date: 2024-12-08, departure_date: 2024-12-15.

But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so maybe the hotels are for a week each, but the dates are based on the flight schedule. However, since the flight dates are not fully specified, the user might need the best prices in those cities, regardless of specific dates. But the user mentioned "staying a week in each city," so the dates are important. Therefore, the hotel searches need to include the check-in and check-out dates.

So, the plan is:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Denver to get their IDs.
2. Use those IDs in Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs as per the flight itinerary.
3. Call Search_Hotel_Destination for Chicago and Dallas to get their dest_id.
4. Use Search_Hotels for Chicago with arrival_date: 2024-12-01, departure_date: 2024-12-08, and sort by price.
5. Use Search_Hotels for Dallas with arrival_date: 2024-12-08, departure_date: 2024-12-15, and sort by price.

But the user might not have provided the exact dates for the hotels, so maybe the dates are inferred from the flight schedule. However, the user's message says "around December 1," so the flight dates are approximate. Therefore, the hotel dates would be based on
