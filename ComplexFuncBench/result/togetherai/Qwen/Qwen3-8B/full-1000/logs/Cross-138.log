2025-08-15 00:05:52,563 - evaluation_logger_Cross-138 - INFO - Query: Help me check the details of the fastest plane tickets from Los Angeles to Orlando on December 15, 2024, and from Orlando to Miami on December 17, 2024. I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in Orlando and Miami for two days each. Please provide hotels within 40 kilometers of the related airports in Orlando and Miami based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want the fastest plane tickets from Los Angeles to Orlando on December 15, 2024, and then from Orlando to Miami on December 17, 2024. They also need hotels within 40 km of the airports in Orlando and Miami based on the arrival airports. 

Starting with the flights: The user mentioned "fastest" so I should use the Search_Flights tool with sort parameter set to FASTEST. But I need the fromId and toId for both legs. For the first leg, LA to Orlando, I need to find the airport IDs. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help get the airport IDs for Los Angeles and Orlando. Wait, the user provided the cities, so I should call Search_Flight_Location for "Los Angeles" to get the fromId and for "Orlando" to get the toId. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights tool with departDate as 2024-12-15.

Next, the return flight from Orlando to Miami on 2024-12-17. Again, need the airport IDs for Orlando (as fromId) and Miami (toId). So another call to Search_Flight_Location for "Orlando" and "Miami". Then use those in Search_Flights with departDate 2024-12-17 and sort by FASTEST.

Once I have the flight details, the user wants hotel bookings near the airports. For each arrival airport (Orlando and Miami), I need the latitude and longitude. So first, get the airport details for Orlando and Miami. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location might return the airport's ID, but maybe the location details include coordinates. Alternatively, maybe I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long for the airport names. But the user specified to base hotels on the arrival airports of the flights. So after getting the flight details, the arrival airports would be Orlando (for the first flight) and Miami (for the second). But to get the coordinates for the airports, perhaps I need to use the Search_Flight_Location again to get the airport's location details, which might include coordinates. Alternatively, use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names. 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool's description says it finds airports by location, address, etc., and returns an ID. The parameters require a query, which can be the airport name. So for example, searching "Orlando International Airport" would give the airport's ID. Then, using that ID in the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool. But the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires latitude and longitude. So maybe after getting the airport's location details (like coordinates) via Search_Flight_Location, then use those coordinates in the hotel search. Alternatively, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long tool can be used with the airport names to get their coordinates. 

But the user wants hotels within 40 km of the related airports. So for each arrival airport (Orlando and Miami), I need to get their coordinates, then use those in the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool with radius 40 km. 

So the steps are:

1. For the first flight (LA to Orlando):
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get fromId.
   b. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Orlando" to get toId.
   c. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate 2024-12-15, sort FASTEST.

2. For the second flight (Orlando to Miami):
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Orlando" to get fromId (same as previous toId?).
   b. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" to get toId.
   c. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate 2024-12-17, sort FASTEST.

3. For hotels in Orlando (arrival airport of first flight):
   a. Get the airport's coordinates (maybe via Search_Flight_Location or Location_to_Lat_Long for "Orlando International Airport").
   b. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-17, radius 40, latitude and longitude from step 3a.

4. For hotels in Miami (arrival airport of second flight):
   a. Get Miami's airport coordinates similarly.
   b. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-12-17, departure_date 2024-12-19 (since they stay for two days), radius 40, latitude and longitude from step 4a.

But the user mentioned staying in Orlando and Miami for two days each. So for Orlando, arrival is Dec 15, departure would be Dec 17. For Miami, arrival Dec 17, departure Dec 19. 

But the user wants to book separately, so maybe the hotel dates are based on the arrival airports. So for the first leg, after arriving in Orlando on Dec 15, they stay two days, so departure from Orlando is Dec 17. Then, for Miami, arriving Dec 17, staying two days until Dec 19. 

So the hotel searches would be:

- Orlando: arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-17, radius 40 km.
- Miami: arrival_date 2024-12-17, departure_date 2024-12-19, radius 40 km.

But to get the coordinates for the airports, I need to use either Search_Flight_Location or Location_to_Lat_Long. Let me check the tools again. 

The Search_Flight_Location tool's description says it finds airports by location, address, etc., and returns an ID. The parameters require a query, which can be the airport name. However, the response might include the airport's coordinates? The tool's description doesn't specify, but the parameters don't mention returning coordinates. Alternatively, the Location_to_Lat_Long tool can be used with the airport name to get the coordinates. 

So for example, to get the coordinates of Orlando International Airport, use Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Orlando International Airport". Then, use those coordinates in the hotel search. 

But the user might not know the exact airport names, so maybe using the city names is better. However, the Search_Flight_Location might return multiple airports. But the user is likely referring to the main airports. 

So, for the first flight's arrival in Orlando, the airport is likely Orlando International Airport (MCO). Similarly, Miami's airport is Miami International Airport (MIA). 

So steps for hotels:

1. For Orlando:
   a. Call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Orlando International Airport" to get latitude and longitude.
   b. Use those in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-17, radius 40, etc.

2. For Miami:
   a. Call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami International Airport" to get coordinates.
   b. Use in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-12-17, departure_date 2024-12-19, radius 40.

But the user might not know the exact airport names, so maybe using the city names is safer. However, the Location_to_Lat_Long tool might return multiple locations. But given the context, it's better to use the airport names to get accurate coordinates.

So, the plan is:

First, get the flight details for both legs, then get the airport coordinates for Orlando and Miami, then search hotels around those airports.

But the user wants to book separately, so the hotel searches are based on the arrival airports of each flight. So for the first flight arriving in Orlando, the hotel is in Orlando, and for the second flight arriving in Miami, the hotel is in Miami.

So, the tool calls needed are:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles (fromId for first flight).
2. Search_Flight_Location for Orlando (toId for first flight).
3. Search_Flights for LA to Orlando, Dec 15, sort FASTEST.
4. Search_Flight_Location for Orlando (fromId for second flight).
5. Search_Flight_Location for Miami (toId for second flight).
6. Search_Flights for Orlando to Miami, Dec 17, sort FASTEST.
7. Location_to_Lat_Long for Orlando International Airport (latitude and longitude for Orlando hotels).
8. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Orlando, arrival 2024-12-15, departure 2024-12-17, radius 40.
9. Location_to_Lat_Long for Miami International Airport (latitude and longitude for Miami hotels).
10. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for Miami, arrival 2024-12-17, departure 2024-12-19, radius 40.

But the user might not have the exact airport names, so maybe using the city names. However, the Location_to_Lat_Long tool might return multiple locations. But given the context, it's better to use the airport names.

So, the first step
