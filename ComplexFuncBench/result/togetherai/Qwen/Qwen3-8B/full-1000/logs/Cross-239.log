Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want to book the best flight from Toronto to San Francisco on December 15, 2024, without overnight layovers. Then, they need a hotel near Golden Gate Park for three days. Lastly, a taxi from the airport to the hotel an hour after landing.

Starting with the flight. The user mentioned "best flight," which probably means they want the fastest or cheapest. The Search_Flights tool has a 'sort' parameter with options BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST. Since they specified "best," I'll assume they mean the fastest, but maybe they want the cheapest. Wait, the user says "best flight," which is a bit ambiguous. However, the tool's enum includes BEST, so I should use that. Also, they don't want overnight layovers, so I need to ensure the flight duration doesn't include overnight stops. But the tool's parameters don't have a direct option for layover duration. Maybe the API handles that, or perhaps it's implied by the sort parameter. I'll proceed with sorting by BEST and check if the API returns flights without layovers. If not, maybe the user will need to adjust, but as per the given tools, I can only use the parameters available.

Next, the flight requires fromId and toId. The user is flying from Toronto to San Francisco. To get these IDs, I need to use the Search_Flight_Location endpoint. So first, I should call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto (from) and San Francisco (to). Wait, but the user hasn't provided the airport codes yet. The Search_Flight_Location tool takes a query parameter, which can be the city name. So I'll need to call that tool twice: once for Toronto and once for San Francisco to get their respective fromId and toId. Then, use those in the Search_Flights call.

Then, the departure date is December 15, 2024. The return date isn't mentioned, but the user is staying three days, so maybe the return date is December 18, 2024. Wait, the user hasn't specified a return date. The original request is for a flight on December 15, but the hotel is for three days. Assuming the flight is one-way, but the user might need a return flight. However, the user hasn't mentioned returning, so maybe it's a one-way trip. The Search_Flights tool requires departDate, but returnDate is optional. Wait, looking back at the parameters for Search_Flights: required are toId, fromId, departDate. ReturnDate is optional. So if the user is only going one way, returnDate isn't needed. But the user might need a return flight. However, the original query says "book the best flight from Toronto to San Francisco on December 15, 2024," which sounds like a one-way trip. So I'll proceed with departDate as 2024-12-15.

Next, the hotel booking. The user wants a hotel near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco for three days. The Search_Hotels tool requires search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. The search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So first, I need to find the dest_id for San Francisco using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "San Francisco". Then, use that dest_id in the Search_Hotels call. The arrival date would be December 15, 2024, and departure date December 18, 2024 (three days stay). The search_type might be "hotel" or another type, but the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the search_type is determined by the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. Alternatively, the search_type parameter is retrieved from that endpoint. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "San Francisco" to get the dest_id and possibly the search_type. Then use that in Search_Hotels.

For the taxi, the user needs a ride from the airport to the hotel one hour after the flight lands. The flight's arrival time isn't specified, but the taxi needs to be booked for the day of arrival. The Search_Taxi tool requires pick_up_place_id and drop_off_place_id, which can be obtained via Taxi_Search_Location. The airport in San Francisco is likely San Francisco International Airport (SFO), so I need to get the googlePlaceId for SFO using Taxi_Search_Location with query "San Francisco International Airport". The hotel is near Golden Gate Park, so I need to get the googlePlaceId for that area. However, the user hasn't specified the exact hotel name, so maybe the taxi can be booked to the hotel's address once the hotel is booked. But since the user hasn't booked the hotel yet, perhaps the taxi can be booked to the hotel's location, which might require the hotel's address. Alternatively, the user might need to provide the hotel's address, but since the hotel isn't booked yet, maybe the taxi can be booked to the general area of Golden Gate Park. However, the user might need the exact address. This could be a problem. Alternatively, the taxi can be booked to the hotel's location once the hotel is booked, but since the user is asking to book all three (flight, hotel, taxi), the taxi booking might need to be done after the hotel is booked. But the user wants all three booked. So perhaps the taxi can be booked with the hotel's address once the hotel is booked. However, the current tools don't allow for dynamic data, so the assistant would need to first book the hotel, get the address, then use that for the taxi. But the user's query is to book all three, so the assistant needs to handle this in sequence.

Putting it all together:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco to get toId.
3. Use fromId, toId, departDate (2024-12-15) in Search_Flights with sort=BEST.
4. Call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get dest_id and search_type.
5. Use dest_id, arrival_date=2024-12-15, departure_date=2024-12-18, search_type from step 4 in Search_Hotels.
6. For taxi, get pick_up_place_id (airport) via Taxi_Search_Location with query "San Francisco International Airport".
7. Get drop_off_place_id (hotel) via Taxi_Search_Location with query "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" or the hotel's address once booked. But since the hotel isn't booked yet, maybe the user will need to provide the hotel's address, but the assistant can't do that. Alternatively, the taxi can be booked to the general area, but that's not precise. This might be a limitation. However, the user might have to provide the hotel's address, but since the assistant can't know it yet, perhaps the taxi can be booked to the hotel's location once the hotel is booked. But the user wants all three booked. So the assistant would need to first book the hotel, get the address, then book the taxi. But the user's query is to book all three, so the assistant needs to handle this in sequence.

But the user's query is to book all three, so the assistant must proceed step by step. So first, the flight, then the hotel, then the taxi. However, the taxi requires the hotel's address, which isn't known until the hotel is booked. Therefore, the assistant would need to first book the flight, then the hotel, then the taxi. But the user might not have provided the hotel's address, so the assistant can't proceed. However, the user might have to provide the hotel's address, but since the user hasn't, the assistant can't proceed. Alternatively, the assistant can use the hotel's location (Golden Gate Park) as the drop-off place. But the Taxi_Search_Location tool requires a query, so the assistant can search for "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get the googlePlaceId for the drop-off. However, the hotel might be in that area, but the exact address isn't known. This is a possible issue, but the assistant can proceed with the best available information.

So, the steps are:

1. Search Flight Locations for Toronto and San Francisco to get fromId and toId.
2. Search Flights with those IDs, sort by BEST, departDate 2024-12-15.
3. Search Hotel Destination for "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco" to get dest_id and search_type.
4. Search Hotels with dest_id, arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-18, search_type from step 3.
5. Search Taxi Locations for San Francisco International Airport (pick_up_place_id) and Golden Gate Park (drop_off_place_id).
6. Book Taxi with those place_ids, pick_up_time one hour after flight arrival.

But the flight's arrival time isn't known yet. The user said "one hour after the flight lands," but the flight's arrival time isn't specified. The assistant can't know that without the flight details. So the taxi's pick_up_time would need to be set to a time after the flight's arrival. However, the flight's arrival time isn't known yet. This is a problem. The assistant can't proceed without that information. Therefore, the assistant might need to first book the flight, get the arrival time, then calculate the pick_up_time. But the user's query is to book all three
