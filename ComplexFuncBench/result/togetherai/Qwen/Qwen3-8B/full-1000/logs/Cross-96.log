Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want to find the best air tickets from New York to Los Angeles on December 1, 2024. Then, they need a taxi arranged for airport transfers, including a pickup from Shangri-La Hotel New York at 10 AM and a drop-off at Marriott Hotel Los Angeles after landing.

Starting with the flight search. The user mentioned "best air tickets," which probably means they want the cheapest or fastest options. The Search_Flights tool requires fromId and toId, which are airport IDs. But the user provided city names, so I need to first find the airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location for both New York and Los Angeles. 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint takes a query parameter. So I should call that for "New York" to get the fromId, and "Los Angeles" for the toId. Once I have those IDs, I can use them in the Search_Flights tool. The user wants the best tickets, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST" or "BEST". The user didn't specify a cabin class, so maybe default to ECONOMY. Also, the departure date is December 1, 2024. 

Next, the taxi arrangements. The user needs a taxi from Shangri-La Hotel New York to the airport and then from the airport to Marriott Hotel Los Angeles. For the taxi, I need the Google Place IDs for both hotels and the airport. The Taxi_Search_Location tool can get the place IDs based on the hotel names. So first, call Taxi_Search_Location for "Shangri-La Hotel New York" to get the pick-up place ID. Then, search for "Los Angeles Airport" to get the airport's place ID. Finally, search for "Marriott Hotel Los Angeles" for the drop-off place ID. 

Once I have all the place IDs, use the Search_Taxi tool to book the taxi. The pickup time is 10 AM on December 1, 2024. The drop-off time would be after the flight arrives, but since the flight details aren't known yet, maybe the user expects the taxi to wait at the airport upon arrival. So the taxi request should include the airport's place ID as the drop-off location. 

Wait, the user mentioned the taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands. So the taxi pickup is from the hotel, and the drop-off is at the airport. Wait, no: the user says "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport." So the first taxi is from the hotel to the airport (pickup from hotel, drop-off at airport). Then, upon arrival, the taxi should wait at the airport to take them to the Marriott. So two taxi bookings: one from hotel to airport, and another from airport to hotel. But the user might want a single taxi that picks them up from the hotel and drops them at the airport, and then another taxi to take them from the airport to the Marriott. Or maybe a round trip. But the user's message says "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport." So maybe two separate taxi services: one for going to the airport, and another for returning. But the user might not have specified the return date, so maybe just the one-way trip. 

But the user's message says "I'm planning to leave Shangri-La Hotel New York for the airport at 10 AM. The taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands and take me to Marriott Hotel Los Angeles." So the taxi is for the trip from the hotel to the airport (departure) and then from the airport to the Marriott (arrival). So two taxi services: one for departure and one for arrival. 

But the user might need to book both. So first, get the place IDs for Shangri-La Hotel New York (pick-up), Los Angeles Airport (drop-off for departure), and Marriott Hotel Los Angeles (drop-off for arrival). Then, book two taxi services: one from Shangri-La to airport, and another from airport to Marriott. 

But the user might not have specified the return date, so maybe only the departure taxi is needed. However, the user's message says "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport," which implies both directions. But since the user is leaving on December 1, maybe the return is not specified. However, the user might need the taxi to wait at the airport upon arrival, so the taxi should be arranged for the arrival. 

So, steps:

1. Find the airport IDs for New York and Los Angeles using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Search for flights from New York to Los Angeles on December 1, sorted by best or cheapest.
3. Find the place IDs for Shangri-La Hotel New York, Los Angeles Airport, and Marriott Hotel Los Angeles using Taxi_Search_Location.
4. Book a taxi from Shangri-La Hotel to Los Angeles Airport at 10 AM on Dec 1.
5. Book another taxi from Los Angeles Airport to Marriott Hotel Los Angeles, with the pickup time set to the flight's arrival time. However, since the flight arrival time isn't known yet, maybe the user expects the taxi to wait at the airport upon arrival, so the drop-off is at the Marriott. 

But the user hasn't provided the flight details yet, so the taxi for the arrival would need to be scheduled after the flight arrives. However, without knowing the flight's arrival time, the taxi can't be scheduled precisely. So perhaps the user expects the taxi to be available at the airport upon arrival, so the taxi service is booked for the airport to Marriott, with the pickup time as the flight's arrival time. But since the flight details aren't known yet, maybe the user just needs the taxi to be arranged to wait at the airport. 

Alternatively, the user might need to book the taxi for the departure and the arrival. But since the arrival time is unknown, the arrival taxi can't be scheduled. So maybe the user only needs the departure taxi. 

But the user's message says "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport," which implies both directions. So the user might need two taxi services: one from the hotel to the airport (departure) and another from the airport to the hotel (arrival). However, the user is leaving on December 1, so the arrival taxi would be for the return trip, which isn't specified. 

This is a bit ambiguous. But given the information, the user is leaving on Dec 1, so the taxi for the departure is needed. The arrival taxi would be for the return, but the user hasn't mentioned returning. However, the user says the taxi should wait at the Los Angeles airport when the plane lands and take them to the Marriott. So the arrival taxi is needed. 

But without knowing the flight's arrival time, the taxi can't be scheduled. So perhaps the user expects the taxi to be available at the airport upon arrival, so the taxi is booked for the airport to Marriott, with the pickup time as the flight's arrival time. But since the flight details aren't known yet, the taxi can't be scheduled. 

This is a problem. So maybe the user just needs the departure taxi, and the arrival taxi is to be arranged upon arrival. But the user might need to book the arrival taxi in advance. 

Alternatively, the user might not have provided the return date, so the taxi for the arrival is not needed. 

This is a bit confusing. But given the user's message, I'll proceed to book the departure taxi from the hotel to the airport, and the arrival taxi from the airport to the Marriott, assuming that the arrival time is known once the flight is booked. 

So, first, call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get fromId, and "Los Angeles" to get toId. Then use those in Search_Flights. Then, call Taxi_Search_Location for the hotel names to get the place IDs. Then, use those in Search_Taxi for the departure and arrival taxis. 

But the user might not have provided the return date, so the arrival taxi might not be needed. However, the user explicitly mentioned the taxi should wait at the airport upon landing, so the arrival taxi is needed. 

So, the steps are:

1. Search Flight Locations for New York and Los Angeles to get fromId and toId.
2. Search Flights with those IDs, sorted by best or cheapest.
3. Search Taxi Locations for Shangri-La Hotel New York, Los Angeles Airport, and Marriott Hotel Los Angeles to get their place IDs.
4. Book a taxi from Shangri-La to Los Angeles Airport at 10 AM on Dec 1.
5. Book a taxi from Los Angeles Airport to Marriott Hotel Los Angeles, with the pickup time set to the flight's arrival time. However, since the flight arrival time isn't known, maybe the user expects the taxi to be available at the airport upon arrival, so the pickup time is the flight's arrival time. But without knowing the flight's arrival time, this can't be scheduled. 

This is a problem. So perhaps the user just needs the departure taxi, and the arrival taxi is to be arranged upon arrival. But the user might need to book the arrival taxi in advance. 

Alternatively, the user might not have provided the return date, so the arrival taxi isn't needed. 

But the user's message says "arrange a taxi for me to get to and from the airport," which implies both directions. So the user might need both. 

In any case, the first step is to find the flight information, then the taxi information. 

So, the first tool calls would be:
