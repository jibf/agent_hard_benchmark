Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want the best-priced multi-stop flight around December 5, 2024, departing from Toronto with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, then continuing to Montreal. Also, they need affordable hotel recommendations for Winnipeg and Calgary, staying a week each.

First, the flight part. The user mentioned interlining flights with specific stops. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API seems necessary here. But I need the fromId and toId for each leg. The legs are Toronto to Winnipeg, Winnipeg to Calgary, Calgary to Montreal. But how do I get the IDs for these locations? The Search_Flight_Location API can find airport IDs based on city names. So I should first call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Montreal to get their IDs.

Wait, the user said "departing from Toronto" but the first leg is Toronto to Winnipeg. Then stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, then to Montreal. So the legs array would be three legs: Toronto to Winnipeg, Winnipeg to Calgary, Calgary to Montreal. But the departure date is December 5, 2024. The API requires dates for each leg. The user wants flights around that date, so maybe the departure date is Dec 5, and the return date would be Dec 12? Wait, the user is staying a week in each city. Let me think: departing from Toronto on Dec 5, then staying a week in Winnipeg (Dec 5-12?), then Calgary (Dec 12-19?), then Montreal (Dec 19-26?), and then returning? Wait, the user didn't mention return dates, but the flight might be one-way? Or maybe the multi-stop is part of a round trip? The user's query is a bit unclear. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is for multi-stop flights, which could be one-way or round-trip. However, the example given in the parameters shows legs as departure and arrival, so maybe it's a one-way trip with multiple stops. But the user is staying a week in each city, so perhaps the flight is from Toronto to Montreal with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, and then they stay in each city. But the user might need a return flight as well. However, the query doesn't specify return dates. Maybe the user is looking for a one-way flight from Toronto to Montreal with stops, and then hotels in Winnipeg and Calgary for the stay. But the flight details need to be clarified. However, the user's main request is for the best-priced multi-stop flight around Dec 5, departing from Toronto with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, then to Montreal. So the legs would be Toronto to Winnipeg, Winnipeg to Calgary, Calgary to Montreal. The departure date for the first leg is Dec 5, 2024. The API requires the date for each leg. But the user might be looking for flights that depart on Dec 5 and arrive in Montreal on a later date. However, the API's description says it returns flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is Dec 5, and the API will look for flights around that date. But the legs need to have specific dates. Wait, the legs array requires each leg's date. So the user's flight would have three legs: Toronto to Winnipeg on Dec 5, Winnipeg to Calgary on Dec 6, Calgary to Montreal on Dec 7. But the user might not have specified the exact dates, just the general time frame. However, the API requires specific dates. So perhaps the user wants the flight to depart on Dec 5, with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, and arrive in Montreal on Dec 7. But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so maybe the API can handle that. Alternatively, the user might need the flight to have stops in those cities, but the exact dates are flexible. However, the API requires specific dates for each leg. So I need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed with the first leg's date as Dec 5, 2024, and subsequent legs as the next days. But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so maybe the API can handle a range. However, the parameters require specific dates. So perhaps the user is looking for a flight that departs Toronto on Dec 5, with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, and arrives in Montreal on Dec 7. So the legs would be:

1. Toronto to Winnipeg on Dec 5
2. Winnipeg to Calgary on Dec 6
3. Calgary to Montreal on Dec 7

But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so maybe the API can find flights that fit around Dec 5. However, the API's description says it returns flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is Dec 5, and the API will look for flights from Dec 1 to Dec 10. But the legs need specific dates. So perhaps the user's flight is a multi-leg journey starting on Dec 5, with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, and then to Montreal. So the legs would be:

- From Toronto (date Dec 5)
- To Winnipeg (date Dec 5)
- Then from Winnipeg to Calgary (date Dec 6)
- Then from Calgary to Montreal (date Dec 7)

But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so maybe the API can handle that. However, the parameters require specific dates. So I need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed with the first leg's date as Dec 5, 2024, and the subsequent legs as the next days. 

Next, the user needs hotel recommendations in Winnipeg and Calgary. For that, the Search_Hotels API can be used. But first, we need the destination IDs for Winnipeg and Calgary. The Search_Hotel_Destination API can find the destination ID based on the city name. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination for Winnipeg and Calgary to get their dest_id. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Hotels API with the arrival and departure dates. The user is staying a week in each city, so for Winnipeg, arrival date would be Dec 5, departure Dec 12. For Calgary, arrival Dec 12, departure Dec 19. But the user might need to adjust based on the flight schedule. However, the user hasn't specified the exact dates for the hotels, just that they stay a week in each. So assuming the flight arrives in Winnipeg on Dec 5, they stay until Dec 12, then fly to Calgary, staying until Dec 19, and then fly to Montreal. But the user might need to adjust the dates based on the flight's actual arrival times. However, the user's main request is for the best-priced flights and hotels, so the hotels' dates would be based on the flight's arrival and departure dates. 

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the airport IDs for Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Montreal.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array containing the three legs (Toronto to Winnipeg, Winnipeg to Calgary, Calgary to Montreal) with dates Dec 5, 6, 7 respectively.
3. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for Winnipeg and Calgary to get their dest_id.
4. Use Search_Hotels for Winnipeg with arrival Dec 5, departure Dec 12, and for Calgary with arrival Dec 12, departure Dec 19, sorted by price.

But the user might not have specified the exact dates for the hotels, so maybe the arrival and departure dates need to be adjusted based on the flight's actual dates. However, since the flight's dates are not known yet, the user might need to provide more details. But the user's query is to find the best-priced flights and hotels, so the flight's dates are part of the search. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API's legs require specific dates. So the user's flight is a multi-leg journey starting on Dec 5, with stops in Winnipeg and Calgary, and arriving in Montreal. So the legs would be:

- Leg 1: Toronto to Winnipeg on Dec 5
- Leg 2: Winnipeg to Calgary on Dec 6
- Leg 3: Calgary to Montreal on Dec 7

But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so the API will look for flights around Dec 5. However, the API's description says it returns flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is Dec 5, and the API will consider flights from Dec 1 to Dec 10. But the legs need specific dates. So the user's flight would have the first leg on Dec 5, the second on Dec 6, and the third on Dec 7. 

Once the flight is found, the hotel dates would be based on the arrival and departure dates. For example, if the flight arrives in Winnipeg on Dec 5, they stay until Dec 12 (a week), then fly to Calgary, arriving on Dec 12, staying until Dec 19, and then fly to Montreal. 

So the steps are:

1. Get airport IDs for Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Montreal using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array as specified.
3. Get dest_id for Winnipeg and Calgary using Search_Hotel_Destination.
4. Use Search_Hotels for Winnipeg with arrival Dec 5, departure Dec 12, and for Calgary with arrival Dec 12, departure Dec 19, sorted by price.

But the user might need to adjust the dates based on the actual flight schedule. However, since the flight's dates are part of the
