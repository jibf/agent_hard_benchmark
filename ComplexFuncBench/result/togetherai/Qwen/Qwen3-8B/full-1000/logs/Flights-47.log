Okay, let's tackle this user's query step by step. The user wants the cheapest economy class air ticket for a multi-stop trip. They're starting from Boston on December 5th, 2024, going through Zurich on the 6th to Geneva, and returning to Boston on the 19th. They also want details like baggage limits.

First, I need to figure out which tools to use. The user mentioned multiple stops, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is necessary. But before that, I might need to get the airport IDs for Boston, Zurich, Geneva, and maybe the return trip. Wait, the return trip is from Geneva to Boston, so I need to check if the user is returning via the same path or a different route. But the user hasn't specified the return legs, so maybe they just want the return trip as a single leg from Geneva to Boston. 

Wait, the user's plan is: Boston (Dec 5) -> Zurich (Dec 6) -> Geneva (Dec 6?), then return to Boston on Dec 19. Wait, the dates might need clarification. Let me check again. The user says: set off from Boston on Dec 5, travel through Zurich on Dec 6, then fly to Geneva. So the first leg is Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th? Wait, the dates might be a bit unclear. Let me parse the dates again.

Original plan: Depart from Boston on Dec 5th, travel through Zurich on Dec 6th, then fly to Geneva. Then return to Boston on Dec 19th. So the outbound trip is Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th, then Zurich to Geneva on Dec 6th? Or is the first leg Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th, and then Zurich to Geneva on Dec 6th? Then the return trip is Geneva to Boston on Dec 19th. 

So the legs for the outbound trip would be two legs: Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th, and Zurich to Geneva on Dec 6th. Then the return leg is Geneva to Boston on Dec 19th. 

But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool requires an array of legs. Each leg has fromId, toId, and date. So for the outbound, the first leg is from Boston (fromId) to Zurich (toId) on Dec 5th. The second leg is from Zurich (fromId) to Geneva (toId) on Dec 6th. Then the return leg is from Geneva (fromId) to Boston (toId) on Dec 19th. 

But wait, the user might have a typo. The first leg is Dec 5th, then the second leg is Dec 6th. So the outbound trip is two legs, and the return is one leg. So the legs array would have three entries? Wait, the user's plan is: depart Boston on Dec 5th, travel through Zurich on Dec 6th, then fly to Geneva. So maybe the first leg is Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th, then Zurich to Geneva on Dec 6th. Then return from Geneva to Boston on Dec 19th. So three legs in total. 

But the user might have intended the return trip as a separate leg. So the legs array would be three legs: Boston to Zurich (Dec 5), Zurich to Geneva (Dec 6), Geneva to Boston (Dec 19). 

But the user's message says "travel through Zurich on December 6th and then fly to Geneva. Finally, I'll return to Boston on December 19th." So the outbound trip is Boston to Zurich on Dec 5th, then Zurich to Geneva on Dec 6th. The return is Geneva to Boston on Dec 19th. So three legs. 

So the first step is to get the airport IDs for Boston, Zurich, Geneva, and Boston again for the return. But the user might not have provided the airport codes, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airport IDs. 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool allows querying by location, city, etc. So for each city (Boston, Zurich, Geneva), I need to call Search_Flight_Location with the query as the city name to get their airport IDs. 

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so I need to assume that Boston is Logan International Airport (BOS), Zurich is Zurich Airport (ZRH), and Geneva is Geneva International Airport (GVA). However, the tool might return multiple airports, so I need to make sure to get the correct ones. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Boston, Zurich, and Geneva to get their airport IDs. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool with the legs array. 

But the user wants the cheapest economy class tickets, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST". Also, the cabinClass is ECONOMY. 

Once the flight details are retrieved, the user wants to check baggage allowances, which requires the Get_Flight_Details tool using the token from the search. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for airport IDs for Boston, Zurich, Geneva, and Boston (for return).
2. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array, specifying the dates and sort by CHEAPEST.
3. Once the token is obtained from the search, use Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info.

But the user's message doesn't mention the number of passengers, so default adults (1) and children (0) can be assumed. 

Wait, the user didn't specify the number of adults or children, so the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would have adults=1, children=0. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for each city. Let's start with Boston. 

But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so the Search_Flight_Location tool is needed. 

So the first tool call would be Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston" to get the airport ID for Boston. Then same for Zurich and Geneva. 

But the user's query is about multiple stops, so the legs array would need the fromId and toId for each leg. 

So the process is:

- Get airport IDs for Boston (from), Zurich (to), Geneva (to), and Boston (return from). 

Wait, the return leg is from Geneva to Boston, so the fromId is Geneva's airport ID, toId is Boston's airport ID. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Boston, Zurich, Geneva. 

Once those IDs are obtained, construct the legs array:

Leg 1: fromId (Boston), toId (Zurich), date Dec 5, 2024.

Leg 2: fromId (Zurich), toId (Geneva), date Dec 6, 2024.

Leg 3: fromId (Geneva), toId (Boston), date Dec 19, 2024.

Then, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with these legs, adults=1, cabinClass=ECONOMY, sort=CHEAPEST.

Once the token is obtained from that search, use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get baggage allowances, etc.

So the first step is to get the airport IDs. But the user hasn't provided them, so the assistant needs to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

But the user's message is in Chinese, but the assistant is to process it. So the assistant needs to make the necessary tool calls in order. 

So the first tool call would be Search_Flight_Location for Boston. Then Zurich, then Geneva. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. 

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so the assistant has to find the correct ones. 

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston" to get the airport ID for Boston. Then same for Zurich and Geneva. 

Once those are obtained, proceed to the multi-stop search. 

But the user's message is in English, so the assistant can proceed. 

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston". Then Zurich, then Geneva. 

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first step is to get the airport ID for Boston. 

Wait, but the user's query is about multiple stops, so the assistant needs to get all the necessary airport IDs first. 

So the assistant would need to make three separate calls to Search_Flight_Location for Boston, Zurich, and Geneva. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle that. 

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "Boston" to get the airport ID for Boston. Then, after getting that, call Search_Flight_Location for Zurich, then Geneva. 

Once all three airport IDs are obtained, then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. 

Then, after getting the token from the search, call Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info. 

So the assistant's first step is to get the airport IDs. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to make these steps in order. 

Therefore, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for Boston. 

But the user might have intended the return trip to be from Geneva to Boston, so the return leg's fromId is Geneva's airport ID and toId is Boston's airport ID. 

So the assistant needs to make three separate calls to get the airport IDs. 

But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first step is to get
