Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They're planning a trip to Calgary from December 5th to 8th, 2024, and they need three top-rated activities and three highly-reviewed hotels, requiring two rooms. 

First, I need to figure out which tools to use. The user mentioned activities and hotels. Looking at the available tools, the Search_Attractions and Search_Hotels endpoints seem relevant. 

Starting with the attractions. The Search_Attractions tool requires an 'id' parameter, which can be obtained from the Search_Attraction_Location. But the user hasn't provided a specific location yet. Wait, the destination is Calgary, so maybe I should first find the location ID for Calgary using Search_Attraction_Location. However, the user's query already specifies Calgary as the destination, so maybe the 'id' for Calgary can be retrieved via that tool. But the parameters for Search_Attractions need an 'id' which is from the searchLocation endpoint. So first, I need to call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Calgary" to get the id. Then use that id in Search_Attractions, sorted by attr_book_score or trending. But the user wants top-rated activities, so maybe sorting by attr_book_score makes sense.

Next, for hotels. The Search_Hotels tool requires parameters like search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date, etc. The dest_id can be obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary". Once I have the dest_id, I can use it in Search_Hotels. The user needs two rooms, so room_qty should be 2. They mentioned three highly-reviewed hotels, so sorting by popularity or attr_book_score might help. The Search_Hotels has a sort_by parameter which can be popularity, price, etc. 

Wait, the user is asking for three activities and three hotels. So I need to make sure that each tool call retrieves the necessary data. Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the location ID for Calgary using Search_Attraction_Location. This will give the id needed for Search_Attractions.
2. Use Search_Attractions with the obtained id and sort by attr_book_score to get top-rated activities.
3. Find the dest_id for Calgary using Search_Hotel_Destination.
4. Use Search_Hotels with the dest_id, arrival_date as 2024-12-05, departure_date as 2024-12-08, room_qty=2, and sort by popularity or attr_book_score to get highly-reviewed hotels.

But the user hasn't provided the exact number of adults or children. The initial query mentions "my three family members and I", so that's four people total. Assuming adults and children, but the parameters for Search_Hotels require adults and children_age. However, the user hasn't specified the exact number of adults or children. The default for adults is 1, but since there are four people, maybe adults=4? Or maybe the user has three family members plus themselves, making four adults. But without explicit info, maybe I should use the default or make an assumption. However, the user might not have provided that detail, so perhaps the tool allows for default values. Alternatively, the user might need to specify, but since they didn't, maybe proceed with the default and note that. But the problem is that the user is asking for three highly-reviewed hotels, so the Search_Hotels parameters need to be set correctly. 

Wait, the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. The search_type can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. Wait, the search_type parameter in Search_Hotels is described as being retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So first, I need to get the search_type for Calgary. But the searchDestination endpoint returns a search_type, which is a string. However, the user's query is about Calgary, so I need to call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary" to get the dest_id, but also maybe the search_type? Wait, the parameters for Search_Hotel_Destination are just query, and the response includes the latitude and longitude. The search_type for the Search_Hotels is a different parameter. Wait, the description for search_type in Search_Hotels says it can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So perhaps the searchDestination endpoint returns a search_type value. But the user's query is about Calgary, so I need to call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary" to get the dest_id, and maybe the search_type is part of that response. However, the description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude, not the search_type. Hmm, maybe I need to check the tool descriptions again.

Looking back: The Search_Hotels parameters have a search_type that can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So the searchDestination endpoint is part of the Hotels collection. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary" to get the dest_id. Then, the search_type for the Search_Hotels would be something else. Wait, maybe the search_type is a parameter that's part of the searchDestination response. But the description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude. Maybe the search_type is a different parameter. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the search_type is a fixed value, but the tool's description says it can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So perhaps the search_type is a string that's part of the response from searchDestination. But without knowing the exact response structure, it's a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is not required for the initial call, but the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So to get the search_type, I need to call another endpoint. Wait, the description for search_type in Search_Hotels says it can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So perhaps the searchDestination endpoint returns a search_type value. But the description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the search_type is a parameter that's part of the searchDestination response. For example, when you call searchDestination with query "Calgary", it might return a search_type value. But the tool's description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude. This is conflicting. Maybe the search_type is a different parameter. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to proceed step by step. 

First, for the attractions: 

1. Call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Calgary" to get the id. 
2. Then, use that id in Search_Attractions with sort_by "attr_book_score" to get top-rated activities. 

For the hotels: 

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary" to get the dest_id. 
2. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels. But the required parameters for Search_Hotels include search_type, which needs to be retrieved from searchDestination. Wait, the description for search_type in Search_Hotels says it can be retrieved from the searchDestination endpoint. So perhaps the searchDestination endpoint returns a search_type value. But the description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude. Maybe there's a mistake in the tool description. Alternatively, maybe the search_type is a parameter that's part of the searchDestination response. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is a fixed value, like "city" or "destination", but without more info, it's hard to say. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user's main goal is to get the top-rated activities and hotels, so I'll proceed with the steps I can. 

So, first, for attractions: 

Call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Calgary" to get the id. Then use that id in Search_Attractions with sort_by "attr_book_score" to get top-rated activities. 

For hotels: 

Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Calgary" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels. The required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. Assuming that the search_type is "city" or similar, but since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the search_type is part of the searchDestination response. However, the tool's description for Search_Hotel_Destination says it returns latitude and longitude, not the search_type. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is not required, but the required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So without knowing the search_type, I can't proceed. This suggests that there's a missing step. 

Wait, the user is asking for hotels in Calgary, so the search_type might be "city" or "destination". But without knowing the exact value, perhaps the search_type is a fixed value. Alternatively, maybe the search_type is obtained from the searchDestination endpoint. 

This is a bit of a dead end. Given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with the available information. 

So, for the hotels, the required parameters are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. Assuming that the search_type is "city" (as a placeholder), and the arrival_date is 2024-12-05, departure_date 2024-12-08, dest_id obtained from Search_Hotel_Destination. 

But the user needs two rooms, so room_qty=2. 

Putting it all together, the steps would be:

1. Call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Calgary" to get the id for attractions.
2. Call Search_At
