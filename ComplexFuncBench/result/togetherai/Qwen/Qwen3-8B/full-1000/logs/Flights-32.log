Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to plan a trip from London to Paris and Berlin, staying a week in each, then returning to London on December 15th. They need economy class flights with detailed info and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey is London → Paris → Berlin → London. Wait, the user mentioned leaving London on Dec 1st, staying in Paris and Berlin each for a week. So the outbound trip is London to Paris on Dec 1st, then Paris to Berlin, and then Berlin back to London on Dec 15th. Wait, but the return date is Dec 15th, so the return flight would be Berlin to London on that date. But the user said they'll stay in each city for a week. Let me check the dates again.

Leaving London on Dec 1st, staying in Paris for a week (so until Dec 8th?), then Berlin for a week (Dec 8th to Dec 15th?), then return to London on Dec 15th. So the outbound legs are London to Paris on Dec 1st, Paris to Berlin on Dec 8th. The return leg is Berlin to London on Dec 15th. Wait, but the user might have a different schedule. Alternatively, maybe they go London to Paris on Dec 1st, stay there until Dec 8th, then Paris to Berlin on Dec 8th, stay until Dec 15th, then Berlin to London on Dec 15th. That makes sense.

So the legs for the outbound trip are two legs: London to Paris (Dec 1) and Paris to Berlin (Dec 8). The return leg is Berlin to London (Dec 15). But the user mentioned "return to London on December 15th", so the return flight is from Berlin to London on that date.

Now, the user wants multi-stop flights. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is needed for the outbound journey. But the return flight is a single leg. However, the user might need to book the return flight as a separate leg. But the user's main request is for the entire journey, so maybe the outbound is two legs (London to Paris to Berlin) and the return is one leg (Berlin to London). But the user might need to handle the return flight separately. However, the user hasn't specified the return flight details beyond the date. So perhaps the main focus is on the outbound multi-stop flight, and the return flight can be handled with a separate search.

But the user wants the best economy class flights for the entire journey. So first, I need to find the multi-stop flights from London to Paris to Berlin on Dec 1st and Dec 8th. Then, the return flight from Berlin to London on Dec 15th. But the user might need to book the return flight as well. However, the user hasn't specified the return flight details beyond the date, so maybe the main task is to find the outbound multi-stop flights and the return flight.

But the user's question is about the entire journey, so I need to handle both the outbound and return flights. However, the tools available include Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for multi-stop flights and Get_Flight_Details for detailed info. Also, Get_Seat_Map for seat maps.

So first, for the outbound journey: London to Paris on Dec 1st, then Paris to Berlin on Dec 8th. That's two legs. So the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is needed with legs array containing these two legs. Then, for the return flight, Berlin to London on Dec 15th, which is a single leg. But the user might need to search for that as well.

But the user's main request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey. So the first step is to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound legs. Then, perhaps another search for the return flight. However, the user might not have specified the return flight details beyond the date, so maybe the return flight is a separate query. But the user might need to handle that as well.

But the user's message says they'll return on Dec 15th, so the return flight is from Berlin to London on that date. So I need to find that as well. However, the tools available for flights are Search_Flights_Multi_Stops (for multi-stop) and Search_Flights (for single legs). Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops is for multi-stop flights, but the return flight is a single leg. So perhaps the user needs to search for the return flight using the Search_Flights endpoint. But the user hasn't mentioned that. However, the user's request includes the entire journey, so the return flight is part of it.

But the user's message is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it: "Our company is planning to leave from London on December 1st, 2024, and travel to Paris and Berlin. We'll return to London on December 15th, 2024. We'll stay in each of those cities for a week. Help us find the best economy class flights for this journey and provide the detailed flight information and seat maps."

So the journey is London → Paris → Berlin → London. The outbound is London to Paris to Berlin, and the return is Berlin to London. So the outbound is a multi-stop flight (two legs), and the return is a single leg. Therefore, the user needs to find both the multi-stop outbound and the single-leg return flight.

But the user's main request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey. So first, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool for the outbound legs (London to Paris on Dec 1, Paris to Berlin on Dec 8). Then, use the Search_Flights tool for the return flight (Berlin to London on Dec 15). However, the user hasn't specified the return flight details beyond the date, so maybe the return flight is a separate query. But the user might need to handle that as well.

But the user's question is about the entire journey, so the answer should include both the outbound and return flights. However, the tools available for flights are Search_Flights_Multi_Stops (for multi-stop) and Search_Flights (for single legs). So the first step is to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound journey. Then, call Search_Flights for the return flight. But the user hasn't specified the return flight's details beyond the date, so perhaps the return flight is a single leg from Berlin to London on Dec 15th.

But the user might not have provided the return flight's details, so maybe the answer should focus on the outbound multi-stop flight and the return flight as a single leg. However, the user's message is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the entire round trip as a multi-stop flight, but that's not possible because the return is a separate leg. So the correct approach is to handle the outbound as a multi-stop flight and the return as a single leg.

But the user's main request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey. So the first step is to find the multi-stop outbound flight, then the return flight. However, the user might not have specified the return flight's details, so perhaps the answer should focus on the outbound and mention that the return flight can be found separately. But the user's question is to help find the best flights for the entire journey, so the answer should include both.

But given the tools available, the first step is to use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound legs. Then, for the return flight, use Search_Flights. However, the user hasn't provided the return flight's details beyond the date, so the return flight's parameters would be from Berlin to London on Dec 15th. But the user might not have specified the departure date for the return flight, but the user said they'll return on Dec 15th, so the return flight's date is Dec 15th.

So, the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to find the outbound multi-stop flight (London to Paris on Dec 1, Paris to Berlin on Dec 8) in economy class.
2. Use Search_Flights to find the return flight (Berlin to London on Dec 15) in economy class.
3. For each flight found, use Get_Flight_Details to get detailed information.
4. For the seat maps, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details.

But the user's question is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey, so the first step is to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound legs. Then, the return flight can be handled similarly. However, the user might not have provided the return flight's details, so the answer should include both the outbound and return flights.

But the user's message is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the user's exact words again: "leave from London on December 1st, 2024, and travel to Paris and Berlin. We'll return to London on December 15th, 2024. We'll stay in each of those cities for a week." So the outbound journey is London to Paris to Berlin, and the return is Berlin to London. The dates for the outbound legs are Dec 1st (London to Paris) and Dec 8th (Paris to Berlin). The return flight is on Dec 15th (Berlin to London).

So the first tool call is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: London to Paris on Dec 1
