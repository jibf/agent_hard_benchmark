We need two rooms. Could you assist us in finding three hotels within forty kilometers of the convention center and provide descriptions of each hotel?

Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user is a research group of three attending a symposium in Los Angeles from November 10th to 15th, 2024. They need two rooms and want three hotels within 40 km of the convention center with descriptions.

First, I need to find the latitude and longitude of the Los Angeles Convention Center. The user mentioned "Los Angeles Convention Center," so I should use the Location to Lat Long endpoint (api/v1/meta/locationToLatLong) to get those coordinates. The query parameter would be "Los Angeles Convention Center."

Once I have the coordinates, the next step is to search for hotels within a 40 km radius. The Search Hotels By Coordinates endpoint (api/v1/hotels/searchHotelsByCoordinates) requires arrival and departure dates, radius, latitude, longitude, and room quantity. The arrival date is November 10th, 2024, and departure is November 15th, 2024. The radius is 40 km, rooms needed are 2. Adults are 3, but the user didn't specify children, so maybe set children_age to an empty string or default. Wait, the parameters for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates include adults, children_age, etc. The user hasn't mentioned children, so maybe set adults to 3 and children_age as empty or not include it. But the required parameters are arrival_date, departure_date, latitude, longitude. So I need to make sure those are included.

After getting the hotel IDs from the search, I need to retrieve descriptions for each using Get_Description_And_Info. But first, I need the hotel IDs. So the steps are:

1. Get coordinates for Los Angeles Convention Center.
2. Use those coordinates to search hotels within 40 km, two rooms, dates Nov 10-15, 2024.
3. From the search results, get hotel IDs.
4. For each hotel ID, call Get_Description_And_Info to get descriptions.

But the user wants three hotels. The search might return more than three, so I need to select the top three or ensure the search returns at least three. Also, the user might need the descriptions, so after getting the hotel IDs, I have to fetch each description.

Wait, the user's question is to find three hotels and provide descriptions. So first, I need to perform the search, then get descriptions for each. But the initial search might not return exactly three, so maybe the system will handle that. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.

First, call locationToLatLong for the convention center. Then use those coordinates in the searchHotelsByCoordinates. Then, for each hotel in the results, call getDescriptionAndInfo. But the user might need the descriptions, so each hotel's info is needed. However, the user might not have specified the exact number, so the system should handle that. Let me proceed step by step.
