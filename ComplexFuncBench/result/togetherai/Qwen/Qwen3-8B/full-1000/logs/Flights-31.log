Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user is planning a trip that starts in New York on November 5th, 2024, going to Los Angeles and Chicago, then returning to New York on November 19th. They want business class flights with detailed info and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The trip is New York to LA and Chicago, then back. Wait, the user says they'll stay in each city for a week. So the outbound trip is New York to LA, then LA to Chicago? Or maybe New York to Chicago first? The user mentions traveling to Los Angeles and Chicago, so maybe they want to go to both cities on the way. But the exact order isn't specified. Hmm, maybe I should assume the first leg is New York to Los Angeles, then Los Angeles to Chicago. Then the return trip would be Chicago to New York. But I need to confirm the legs. Alternatively, maybe they want to go from New York to Chicago first, then Chicago to LA. But without more info, I'll have to make an assumption here. Let me check the user's message again: "leave from New York on November 5th... travel to Los Angeles and Chicago. We'll return to New York on November 19th." So the outbound is New York to LA and Chicago, but the exact order isn't clear. Maybe the user is going to both cities, so the first leg is New York to LA, then LA to Chicago. Then the return is Chicago to New York. But the dates are November 5th to 19th. Wait, the user says they'll stay in each city for a week. So the outbound trip would be New York to LA on Nov 5th, stay there for a week (until Nov 12th), then LA to Chicago on Nov 12th, stay there until Nov 19th, then return to New York on Nov 19th. But that's a bit tight. Alternatively, maybe the outbound is New York to Chicago on Nov 5th, stay there a week (until Nov 12th), then Chicago to LA on Nov 12th, stay until Nov 19th, then return. But the user might not have specified the order. Since the user mentioned "travel to Los Angeles and Chicago," perhaps they want to visit both cities on the way. So the first leg is New York to LA, then LA to Chicago. Then the return is Chicago to New York. But the return date is Nov 19th. So the return trip would be Chicago to New York on Nov 19th. 

But the user might need to have flights that cover all these legs. So the legs array would have three legs: NY to LA on Nov 5th, LA to Chicago on Nov 12th (assuming a week in LA), then Chicago to NY on Nov 19th. Wait, but the return date is Nov 19th, so the return flight would depart on Nov 19th. So the legs would be:

Outbound:
1. New York to Los Angeles on 2024-11-05
2. Los Angeles to Chicago on 2024-11-12 (assuming a week in LA)
Return:
3. Chicago to New York on 2024-11-19

But the user might have a different schedule. However, since the user hasn't specified the exact dates for each leg, I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user is going to both cities in one trip, so the outbound is New York to Chicago, then Chicago to LA, and return is LA to New York. But without more info, I'll proceed with the first assumption.

Next, the user wants business class flights. So the cabinClass parameter should be set to BUSINESS. They also need detailed flight information and seat maps. So after finding the flights, I'll need to call Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map for each flight. But first, I need to search for the multi-stop flights.

So the first step is to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. The legs would be:

[
  { "fromId": "NYC.AIRPORT", "toId": "LAX.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-05" },
  { "fromId": "LAX.AIRPORT", "toId": "ORD.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-12" },
  { "fromId": "ORD.AIRPORT", "toId": "NYC.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-19" }
]

Wait, but the return date is Nov 19th, so the return flight would depart on that date. So the third leg is Chicago to New York on Nov 19th. But the user might need to have the return flight on that date. However, the user's return date is Nov 19th, so the flight would depart on that day. 

But the user might need to have the return flight on Nov 19th, so the third leg's date is 2024-11-19. 

But I need to get the fromId and toId for each airport. The user mentioned New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. So I need to find the airport IDs for these cities. For example, New York's airport ID might be NYC.AIRPORT, Los Angeles is LAX.AIRPORT, and Chicago is ORD.AIRPORT. However, these are just examples. The actual IDs can be retrieved via the Search_Flight_Location endpoint. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided the airport IDs yet. So maybe I need to first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. For example, search for "New York" to get NYC.AIRPORT, "Los Angeles" for LAX.AIRPORT, and "Chicago" for ORD.AIRPORT. 

But the user's query doesn't mention needing to search for locations, but the parameters for the flight search require fromId and toId, which are IDs from the searchDestination endpoint. So I need to first get those IDs. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to find the airport IDs for New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
2. Use those IDs to construct the legs array for the multi-stop flight search.
3. Call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array, specifying business class.
4. Once the flights are found, get the token from the search results and use Get_Flight_Details to get detailed info.
5. Then, for each flight, get the seat map using Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so I need to first find the correct IDs. However, the user might be using common airport codes, so maybe I can assume NYC.AIRPORT for New York, LAX.AIRPORT for LA, and ORD.AIRPORT for Chicago. But to be accurate, I should call the Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

Wait, but the user's message doesn't mention needing to search for locations. They might be assuming that the IDs are known. However, the parameters for the flight search require the fromId and toId, which are obtained from the searchDestination endpoint. So the correct approach is to first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get the fromId for the first leg. Then for "Los Angeles" to get the toId for the first leg and fromId for the second leg. Similarly for Chicago. 

But the user's query is about planning a trip, so the assistant needs to handle the entire process. Therefore, the first step is to retrieve the airport IDs. 

So the first tool call would be Search_Flight_Location for each city. Let's start with New York. 

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so maybe they are using the main airports. For example, New York's main airport is JFK, LGA, or EWR. But the ID might be something like NYC.AIRPORT. However, the actual ID can be retrieved via the searchDestination endpoint. 

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get the airport ID. Then for "Los Angeles" and "Chicago". 

But the user's query is about planning a trip, so the assistant needs to perform these steps. However, the user hasn't provided the airport IDs, so the assistant must first find them. 

Therefore, the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle this step-by-step. However, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So the first step is to get the airport IDs. 

So the first tool call would be Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the fromId for the first leg. Then, similarly for Los Angeles and Chicago. 

But the user's query is about a multi-stop flight, so the legs array requires fromId and toId for each leg. Therefore, the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs for each city. 

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so the assistant needs to find the correct IDs. 

Therefore, the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the airport ID. Then, for "
