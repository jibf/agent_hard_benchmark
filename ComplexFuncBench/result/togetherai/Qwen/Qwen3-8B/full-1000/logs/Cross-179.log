Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Atura Blacktown in Sydney and detailed descriptions. First, I called Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id 593543. The response mentioned Sydney Markets as a close landmark. Then, I used Search_Attraction_Location with "Sydney Markets" to get more details. The tool response gave a product related to transfers and services, but the title mentions Sydney CBD to Airport. Wait, that doesn't seem like an attraction. Maybe the search didn't find the right attraction. The user needs actual attractions, not transfers. I should check if there's another attraction near the hotel. Maybe the initial search only returned one result, but it's not relevant. Perhaps I need to try a different query or check if there's another attraction nearby. Alternatively, maybe the Sydney Markets is the correct one, but the details aren't showing up. Let me think. The user wants detailed descriptions, so if the Search_Attraction_Location isn't giving attraction details, maybe I need to use Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from the first search. Wait, in the Search_Attraction_Location response, there's a productSlug: "pr1h23civ24m-sydney-cbd-to-sydney-airport". But that's under transfers-services, not attractions. So maybe that's not the right slug. The user might need to be informed that the available data is limited to transfers, and perhaps suggest checking other nearby areas or using a different search term. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the tool responses. Since the tools provided include Get_Attraction_Details, perhaps I should use that if I have a slug. But the slug from the search is for a transfer. Maybe the user needs to be told that the available information is about transfers, and there's no attraction details available. Or maybe I should try another attraction name. But the initial search only gave Sydney Markets. Hmm. I need to present the information I have, even if it's not perfect. So, the answer would mention the Sydney Markets as the closest landmark, note that the details found are about transfers, and suggest that there might be no specific attraction details available, or perhaps the user can look for other nearby spots.

The closest landmark to Atura Blacktown is **Sydney Markets**, located approximately 10.4 km away with an average rating of 8.7/10. However, the search results for this location primarily highlight transfer services (e.g., "Sydney CBD to Sydney Airport") rather than specific attractions. 

For detailed attraction information, you might need to refine the search or explore nearby areas. Would you like assistance with alternative recommendations or further details about the Sydney Markets?
