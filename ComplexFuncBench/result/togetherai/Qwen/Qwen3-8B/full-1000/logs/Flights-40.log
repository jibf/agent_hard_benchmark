Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want the cheapest economy class flight from Chicago to Frankfurt to Vienna and back to Chicago between November 10th and 24th, 2024. They also want details like baggage limits.

First, I need to figure out which tools to use. The user mentioned multiple stops, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is necessary. That will help find the multi-leg flights. Then, once they have the flight details, they might need Get_Flight_Details to check baggage allowances and other info.

Wait, the user wants the cheapest option. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops has a 'sort' parameter that can be set to 'CHEAPEST'. That's good. They specified economy class, so the cabinClass should be 'ECONOMY'.

The legs are Chicago to Frankfurt on Nov 10th, Frankfurt to Vienna on Nov 11th, and Vienna back to Chicago on Nov 24th. Each leg needs fromId, toId, and date. I need to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help with that. But the user hasn't provided IDs yet, so I should first call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their IDs.

Wait, but the user might not know the IDs. So the process is: first, search for each location's ID using Search_Flight_Location. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. But the user's message doesn't mention IDs, so I need to retrieve them. However, the user's query is about the flight details, so maybe the assistant should first get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna.

But the user's main request is to check the cheapest economy flights for the multi-stop journey. So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna.
2. Use those IDs in Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest economy flights.
3. Then, use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the search to get baggage info.

But the user hasn't provided the IDs yet. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. However, the user might not know the exact names, but they mentioned Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna. So the query parameter for each would be "Chicago", "Frankfurt", "Vienna".

Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location's query parameter can be names of airports, cities, etc. So for each city, I need to call that tool to get the ID. For example, Chicago's airport ID might be something like "ORD.AIRPORT" or "MDW.AIRPORT". Similarly for Frankfurt (FRA) and Vienna (VIE).

But the user's initial message doesn't have the IDs, so the assistant needs to first retrieve them. However, the user's main request is to check the flight details, so the assistant should first get the airport IDs. But the user might not know that, so the assistant should handle that step.

But the user's message is a single query. So the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs for each city. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.

First, call Search_Flight_Location for Chicago to get its ID. Then for Frankfurt, then Vienna. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. Then, once the flight details are retrieved, use Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to make multiple tool calls. However, the user might not have provided the IDs, so the assistant must first retrieve them. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each of the three cities.

Wait, but the user's message says they are planning to set off from Chicago on November 10th, travel through Frankfurt on November 11th, and then fly to Vienna, returning to Chicago on November 24th. So the legs are:

1. Chicago (departure) to Frankfurt (arrival) on Nov 10
2. Frankfurt (departure) to Vienna (arrival) on Nov 11
3. Vienna (departure) to Chicago (arrival) on Nov 24

So the fromId for the first leg is Chicago's airport ID, toId is Frankfurt's. Second leg from Frankfurt to Vienna. Third leg from Vienna to Chicago.

Therefore, the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs for Chicago, Frankfurt, and Vienna. Then use those in the multi-stop search.

So the first tool call should be Search_Flight_Location with query "Chicago" to get the ID. Then same for Frankfurt and Vienna. Then use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to make these calls step by step. However, the user might not know the IDs, so the assistant must first retrieve them. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But the user's main request is to check the cheapest economy flights for the multi-stop journey. So the assistant should first get the airport IDs, then perform the multi-stop search, then get the flight details.

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for Chicago. Then for Frankfurt, then Vienna. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. Then, once the flight details are retrieved, use Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle this step by step. However, the user might not have provided the IDs, so the assistant must first retrieve them. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But the user's message is asking for the cheapest economy class ticket, so the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs, then perform the multi-stop search with sort=CHEAPEST, cabinClass=ECONOMY, and then get the flight details.

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for Chicago. Then for Frankfurt, then Vienna. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. Then, once the flight details are retrieved, use Get_Flight_Details to get baggage info.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to make these calls in sequence. However, the user might not have provided the IDs, so the assistant must first retrieve them. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city.

But the user's message is asking for the cheapest economy class ticket, so the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs, then perform the multi-stop search with sort=CHEAPEST, cabinClass=ECONOMY, and then get the flight details.
