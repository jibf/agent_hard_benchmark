Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want the best-priced multi-stop flight around December 15, 2024, departing from Edmonton with stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, then continuing to Toronto. Also, they need affordable hotel recommendations for Ottawa and Vancouver, staying a week each.

First, I need to figure out the flight part. The user mentioned an interlining flight with specific stops. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is the right tool here. The legs parameter requires an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date. The user's departure is Edmonton, then stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, ending in Toronto. But the dates for each leg aren't specified. The query date is December 15, 2024, so maybe the main date is that, but the stops might need dates around that. However, the API allows dates within 5 days before and after. Since the user is staying a week in each city, maybe the flight dates should cover the stay. But the user hasn't specified exact dates for each leg. Hmm, perhaps the main date is December 15, and the stops are on the same day? Or maybe the flight is from Edmonton to Ottawa on Dec 15, then Ottawa to Vancouver on Dec 16, and Vancouver to Toronto on Dec 17? But the user might need the flight to cover the entire week. Wait, the user says "around December 15" so maybe the main date is Dec 15, and the stops are on that day. But the API requires each leg's date. So I need to structure the legs as:

1. Edmonton to Ottawa on Dec 15
2. Ottawa to Vancouver on Dec 15
3. Vancouver to Toronto on Dec 15

But that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the user wants a multi-stop flight that starts in Edmonton, goes through Ottawa and Vancouver, and ends in Toronto, with the main departure date around Dec 15. However, the API requires each leg's date. Since the user is staying a week in each city, perhaps the flight dates are Dec 15 to Dec 22 (for Ottawa), then Dec 22 to Dec 29 (Vancouver), and Dec 29 to Jan 5 (Toronto)? But the user hasn't specified exact dates. The API allows dates within 5 days of the query date, so maybe the main date is Dec 15, and the legs are on that date. But that might not be feasible. Alternatively, the user might need the flight to start on Dec 15, with stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, and then to Toronto. So the legs would be:

- Edmonton to Ottawa on Dec 15
- Ottawa to Vancouver on Dec 16
- Vancouver to Toronto on Dec 17

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates for each leg. Since the API allows dates within 5 days of the query date, maybe the main date is Dec 15, and the legs are on that date. However, that might not be possible. Alternatively, the user might need the flight to cover the entire week, but the API's parameters might not support that. The user might need to provide the dates for each leg, but since they haven't, perhaps the best approach is to use the query date as the main date and structure the legs around that. So the legs would be:

1. Edmonton to Ottawa on Dec 15
2. Ottawa to Vancouver on Dec 15
3. Vancouver to Toronto on Dec 15

But that's a single day, which might not be feasible. Alternatively, the user might need the flight to start on Dec 15, with stops on subsequent days. However, without specific dates, the API might not return accurate results. The user might need to adjust the dates, but since the query is around Dec 15, the API will search within 5 days. So I'll proceed with the main date as Dec 15 and structure the legs accordingly.

Next, the hotel recommendations. The user needs affordable hotels in Ottawa and Vancouver. The Search_Hotels API can be used for each city. The parameters include search_type, arrival_date, departure_date, dest_id, etc. The user is staying a week in each city, so the arrival and departure dates would be for each city. For Ottawa, arrival might be Dec 15, departure Dec 22. For Vancouver, arrival Dec 22, departure Dec 29. But the user hasn't specified exact dates, so maybe the main dates are around Dec 15. However, the user might need to adjust. The Search_Hotels API requires arrival and departure dates. Since the user is staying a week in each city, the dates would be:

- Ottawa: arrival Dec 15, departure Dec 22
- Vancouver: arrival Dec 22, departure Dec 29

But the user might need to check availability for those dates. However, the user hasn't provided exact dates, so perhaps the main dates are around Dec 15, and the hotels are booked for a week. The Search_Hotels API can be called for each city with the respective dates. Also, the user wants the most affordable options, so the sort_by parameter should be "price".

But first, I need to get the dest_id for Ottawa and Vancouver using the Search_Hotel_Destination API. The user might not know the exact IDs, so I need to call Search_Hotel_Destination for each city with the query parameter as the city name. For example, query "Ottawa" and "Vancouver".

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for Ottawa to get dest_id.
2. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for Vancouver to get dest_id.
3. Use Search_Hotels for Ottawa with arrival Dec 15, departure Dec 22, sort_by price.
4. Use Search_Hotels for Vancouver with arrival Dec 22, departure Dec 29, sort_by price.

But the user might need to adjust the dates based on the flight schedule. However, since the flight details are not yet known, the hotel dates are based on the user's stay. The user mentioned staying a week in each city, so the dates are 7 days each.

Additionally, the flight part requires the legs. The user's flight is Edmonton to Ottawa, then Ottawa to Vancouver, then Vancouver to Toronto. The dates for each leg need to be specified. Since the user is staying a week in each city, the flight might depart Edmonton on Dec 15, arrive in Ottawa, then stay there until Dec 22, then fly to Vancouver on Dec 22, stay until Dec 29, then fly to Toronto on Dec 29. But the user might need the flight to cover the entire stay. However, the flight's legs would be:

- Edmonton to Ottawa on Dec 15
- Ottawa to Vancouver on Dec 22
- Vancouver to Toronto on Dec 29

But the user might need the flight to be multi-stop with stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, but the exact dates for each leg are not specified. The API allows dates within 5 days of the query date (Dec 15), so the legs can be on Dec 15, 16, 17, etc. But the user's stay in each city is a week, so the flight dates would need to align with that. However, without exact dates, the API might not return the best results. The user might need to adjust the dates, but the assistant can proceed with the query date as Dec 15 and structure the legs accordingly.

So, the first step is to call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs as:

[
  {fromId: Edmonton's ID, toId: Ottawa's ID, date: 2024-12-15},
  {fromId: Ottawa's ID, toId: Vancouver's ID, date: 2024-12-15},
  {fromId: Vancouver's ID, toId: Toronto's ID, date: 2024-12-15}
]

But the user might need the flight to have stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, so the legs are Edmonton to Ottawa, Ottawa to Vancouver, Vancouver to Toronto. The dates for each leg would be consecutive days. However, the user hasn't specified, so the assistant might need to make an assumption. Alternatively, the user might want the flight to start on Dec 15, with stops on the same day, but that's not feasible. So the assistant should proceed with the main date as Dec 15 and the legs on that date, even if it's not realistic, but the API will handle the date range.

But the user might need the flight to have stops in Ottawa and Vancouver, so the legs are Edmonton to Ottawa, then Ottawa to Vancouver, then Vancouver to Toronto. The dates for each leg would be consecutive. However, the user hasn't specified, so the assistant can't know. Therefore, the assistant should use the query date as the main date and structure the legs around that, even if it's not perfect.

So, the first tool call is Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs as:

[
  {fromId: Edmonton's ID, toId: Ottawa's ID, date: 2024-12-15},
  {fromId: Ottawa's ID, toId: Vancouver's ID, date: 2024-12-15},
  {fromId: Vancouver's ID, toId: Toronto's ID, date: 2024-12-15}
]
