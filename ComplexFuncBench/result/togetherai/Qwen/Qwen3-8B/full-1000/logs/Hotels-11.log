2025-08-15 00:39:08,208 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-11 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user is currently at a location with latitude 40.5742 and longitude 107.0774, and they want to check available hotel rooms within 50 km for tonight. Today is December 5th, 2024, so tonight would be the same day, but usually, check-in is the next day. Wait, maybe they mean staying overnight, so arrival on the 5th and departure on the 6th. 

First, I need to use the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool. The parameters required are arrival_date, departure_date, radius, latitude, longitude, and others. The user provided latitude and longitude, radius is 50 km. Arrival date is Dec 5, departure date Dec 6. The tool call was already made, and the response came back with one hotel: Ramada by Wyndham Bayannur. 

Now, the user wants detailed information about all available rooms. The response from the tool includes the hotel's details, but the user might need more specifics like room types, prices, availability. However, the tool's response data includes the hotel_id, which is 10279801. To get more detailed room information, the next step would be to call Get_Room_List_With_Availability using the hotel_id, arrival and departure dates, and other parameters like adults and room quantity. 

But the user hasn't specified the number of adults or rooms, so I should assume defaults: adults=1, room_qty=1. The children_age isn't mentioned, so maybe omit that or set to empty. The tool response already shows the hotel's min_total_price and other details, but the user might need to know if there are multiple room options. The current data shows one room type with 1 bed. 

Wait, the user asked for "detailed information about all available hotel rooms," so maybe the response from Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates only gives a summary, and the next step is to get the room list. However, the tool response includes the hotel_id, so I should use that to call Get_Room_List_With_Availability. 

But the user's initial query was answered with the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates result, which returned one hotel. The assistant's previous response listed that hotel's details. Now, the user might need more info on the rooms available there. So, the next step is to call Get_Room_List_With_Availability with the hotel_id from the response, arrival and departure dates, and other parameters. 

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates beyond "tonight," which might mean arrival on the 5th and departure on the 6th. The tool call already used those dates. So, the assistant should now present the information from the tool response, highlighting the available hotel and its room details. Since the tool response includes the room configuration, price breakdown, and availability, the assistant can summarize that. 

Alternatively, if the user wants more options, maybe there are other hotels, but the response showed only one. The assistant should present the available hotel's details, mention the price, check-in/check-out times, and any other relevant info like free parking or reviews. Also, note if there's low availability or any special offers. 

So, the final answer should list the hotel name, location, price, room details, and availability, based on the tool's response. Make sure to mention that this is the only hotel found within 50 km for the specified dates.

Based on your location (latitude 40.5742, longitude 107.0774) and search for hotels within 50 km for tonight (Dec 5-6, 2024), here's the available option:
