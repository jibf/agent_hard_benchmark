Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel to Miami and Chicago, staying 5 days each, then return to New York. They're unsure about the order (Miami first or Chicago first) and need the cheapest flight departing around December 24, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the possible itineraries. Since they're considering two options—Miami first then Chicago, or vice versa—I should check both routes. But the user mentioned "around December 24th," so maybe they're flexible with the exact date. However, the tools provided don't allow searching for dates around a specific day directly. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops requires specific dates for each leg. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops endpoint can search for the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. That's useful. The user wants the cheapest flight around Dec 24, so using this endpoint might help find the best price. But the legs need to have specific dates. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might handle the date range. 

But the user hasn't decided the order. So I need to check both possible routes: Miami -> Chicago -> New York, and Chicago -> Miami -> New York. For each route, I need to find the cheapest multi-stop flight. 

First, I need to get the location IDs for Miami, Chicago, and New York. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help find those. Let me start by searching for each city's airport codes. 

For example, searching for "Miami" would give the airport ID, say MIA.AIRPORT. Similarly for Chicago (ORD.AIRPORT) and New York (JFK.AIRPORT or LGA.AIRPORT). Once I have those IDs, I can structure the legs for each itinerary.

But the user wants to stay 5 days in each place. However, the flight dates are for departure and return. The stay duration might affect the return date, but the user hasn't specified exact dates, just around Dec 24. So maybe the return date is around Dec 24 + 10 days (since 5 days in each city, plus travel days). But the user might not need the exact return date, just the departure date around Dec 24. 

Wait, the user says "departure date of the cheapest flight around December 24th, 2024." So the departure is from New York to either Miami or Chicago on or around Dec 24, then the return flight from the last city (Chicago or Miami) back to New York. 

But the multi-stop flight requires legs. For example, if going Miami first: New York to Miami, then Miami to Chicago, then Chicago back to New York. Or Chicago first: New York to Chicago, then Chicago to Miami, then Miami back to New York. 

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops requires legs with specific dates. However, the endpoint says it searches within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user's query date is Dec 24, the legs' dates would be between Dec 19 and Dec 30. But the user might need the departure date around Dec 24, so maybe the first leg (from New York to Miami or Chicago) is on Dec 24. 

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates for each leg, just the departure date around Dec 24. So perhaps the first leg's date is Dec 24, and the return leg's date is around Dec 24 + 10 days (since 5 days in each city). However, the exact return date isn't specified, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle that. 

Alternatively, the user might need to search for two separate itineraries: one starting with Miami and one with Chicago, each with the cheapest multi-stop flight. 

But the tools available are Search_Flights_Multi_Stops and Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might be better for finding the cheapest options. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the airport IDs for Miami, Chicago, and New York.
2. For each possible route (Miami first or Chicago first), create legs with the departure date around Dec 24 and return date accordingly.
3. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest multi-stop flights for each route.
4. Compare the prices and select the cheapest one.
5. Then, use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the cheapest flight to get detailed info.

But the user hasn't provided exact dates for each leg, so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might be the way to go. However, the legs need to have specific dates. Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops endpoint's legs require specific dates. But the description says it searches within 5 days before and after the query date. So maybe the legs' dates are flexible. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops parameters require legs with fromId, toId, and date. So each leg must have a specific date. But the endpoint's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So perhaps the query date is the departure date, and the legs' dates are adjusted within that window. 

But the user wants the departure date around Dec 24. So the first leg's date would be around Dec 24. However, the user hasn't specified the return date. So maybe the return leg's date is also within the 5-day window. 

Alternatively, the user might need to search for two separate multi-stop flights: one starting with Miami and one with Chicago, each with the cheapest possible price. 

But the user is asking for the departure date around Dec 24, so the first leg's date is Dec 24. Then, the return leg would be after 10 days (5 days in each city). But the exact return date isn't specified. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me outline the steps again:

1. Find the airport IDs for Miami, Chicago, and New York using Search_Flight_Location.
2. For each possible route (Miami first or Chicago first), create legs with the first leg's date around Dec 24 and the return leg's date around Dec 24 + 10 days.
3. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each route to find the cheapest options.
4. Compare the prices and select the cheapest one.
5. Then, use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the cheapest flight to get detailed info.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe the return leg's date is also around Dec 24. However, that might not make sense. Alternatively, the user might be looking for a round-trip with the departure on Dec 24 and return on a date that allows 5 days in each city. 

Alternatively, the user might be okay with the return date being around Dec 24 as well, but that would require the return flight to be on the same date, which might not be feasible. 

This is a bit ambiguous. Given the tools available, the best approach is to first get the airport IDs, then for each possible route, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs' dates set to the query date (Dec 24) and the return date adjusted accordingly. 

But since the user hasn't specified the return date, maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle the date range. However, the legs require specific dates. 

Alternatively, the user might be looking for a multi-stop flight that starts on Dec 24 and returns after 10 days. But without knowing the exact return date, it's hard to set the legs. 

Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to first search for the airport IDs, then for each route, create legs with the first leg's date as Dec 24 and the return leg's date as Dec 24 + 10 days. Then use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each route. 

But the user might not have specified the return date, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle the date range. However, the legs need specific dates. 

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me proceed step by step. 

First, I need to get the airport IDs for Miami, Chicago, and New York. So I'll call Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

For example, search for "Miami" to get the fromId and toId for Miami. Similarly for Chicago and New York. 

Once I have those IDs, I can structure the legs for each possible route. 

For the first route (Miami first): 
- Leg 1: New York to Miami on Dec 24
- Leg 2: Miami to Chicago on Dec 29 (assuming 5 days in Miami)
- Leg 3: Chicago to New York on Jan 3 (assuming 5 days in Chicago)

But the user might not need the exact return date, just the departure around Dec 24. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops requires specific dates. 

Alternatively, the user might be okay with the return date being around Dec 24 as well, but that's not practical. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops for each possible route, with the legs' dates set to the query date (Dec 24) and the return date adjusted. 

But since the user hasn't specified the return date, maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops can handle the date range. However,
