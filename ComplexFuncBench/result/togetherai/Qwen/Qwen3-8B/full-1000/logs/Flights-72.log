2025-08-15 01:24:03,060 - evaluation_logger_Flights-72 - INFO - Query: We're planning to leave Los Angeles on November 20th, 2024, and travel to London. After staying in London for four days, we'll go to Auckland, then return to Los Angeles on December 4th, 2024. I'm looking for the cheapest premium economy flights for this time period. If the ticket price is over 1100 dollars, we won't stay in London. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Los Angeles to Auckland during this time.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want to plan a trip starting from Los Angeles on November 20th, 2024, going to London, then Auckland, and returning to Los Angeles on December 4th. They're looking for the cheapest premium economy flights. If the total price exceeds $1100, they'll skip London and go directly from LA to Auckland.

First, I need to get the flight location IDs for each city. The user already looked up Los Angeles, London, and Auckland. The IDs are LAX.CITY, LON.CITY, and AKL.AIRPORT respectively. 

Next, the user's journey has two main parts: the outbound trip (LA to London to Auckland) and the return trip (Auckland to LA). But if the initial trip's price is over $1100, they want a direct round-trip from LA to Auckland. 

So, I should first check the multi-stop flight prices. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is needed here because the trip involves multiple legs: LA to London, then London to Auckland. The parameters require an array of legs with fromId, toId, and date. 

The departDate for the first leg is November 20th, 2024. The second leg would depart from London on November 24th (since they stay in London for four days). The return date is December 4th. 

Wait, the user mentioned staying in London for four days. So the departure from London to Auckland would be on November 24th (20th + 4 days). Then the return flight from Auckland to LA on December 4th. 

But the user wants the cheapest premium economy flights. So I need to call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs: LA to London on 2024-11-20, London to Auckland on 2024-11-24, and return from Auckland to LA on 2024-12-04. Wait, the return trip is a separate leg. Wait, the multi-stop is for the outbound, but the return is a separate trip. 

Wait, the user's original plan is LA to London (4 days), then London to Auckland, then return to LA on Dec 4. So the outbound is LA -> London -> Auckland, and the return is Auckland -> LA. 

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is for multi-stop flights, which might handle the outbound legs. However, the return trip is a separate flight. So maybe first check the multi-stop for LA to London to Auckland, then check the return flight from Auckland to LA. 

But the user's condition is if the total price (including London stay) is over $1100, they want a direct round-trip from LA to Auckland. So the initial check is for the multi-stop trip. 

So first, call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with legs: LA to London (2024-11-20), London to Auckland (2024-11-24). Then the return flight from Auckland to LA on 2024-12-04. Wait, but the return date is Dec 4th. So the return flight would be from Auckland to LA on that date. 

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is for the outbound legs. The return trip is a separate flight. So maybe the user needs to check the multi-stop for the outbound and then the return flight. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the entire round-trip, including the multi-stop. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not handle the return. So perhaps the user needs to check the multi-stop for the outbound (LA to London to Auckland) and then check the return flight from Auckland to LA. 

But the user's initial query is about the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire period. So the first step is to get the multi-stop flight prices for LA to London to Auckland, then check the return flight. 

But the user's condition is if the total price (including London stay) is over $1100, they want a direct round-trip from LA to Auckland. So the first step is to check the multi-stop flight price. 

So, the first API call should be Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs: LA to London (departDate 2024-11-20), London to Auckland (departDate 2024-11-24). Then, the return flight from Auckland to LA on 2024-12-04. 

Wait, but the return flight is a separate leg. So the user might need to check the return flight's price as well. However, the user's main concern is the total cost of the entire trip. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the entire round-trip, including the multi-stop and return. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not handle the return. So perhaps the user needs to check the multi-stop for the outbound and then the return flight. 

But the user's initial request is to check the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire period. So the first step is to get the multi-stop flight prices for LA to London to Auckland, then check the return flight.

But the return flight's price would be another API call. However, the user's main query is about the entire trip. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the entire round-trip as a multi-stop, but that's not possible. So the user needs to check the outbound multi-stop and the return flight. 

But the user's main query is to find the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire period. So the first step is to check the multi-stop for the outbound (LA to London to Auckland) and then the return flight. 

But the user's condition is if the total price (including London stay) is over $1100, they want a direct round-trip from LA to Auckland. So the first step is to check the multi-stop flight price.
