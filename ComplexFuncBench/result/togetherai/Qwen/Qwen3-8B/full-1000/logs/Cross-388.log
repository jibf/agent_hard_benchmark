After the meeting ends at 12 PM, I will fly from Seattle to Denver for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Denver after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up theÂêóhotel within 40 kilometers of the airport in Denver and check what fun places there are around the hotel.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they have a meeting at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle on December 15, 2024, ending at 12 PM. After that, they need to fly from Seattle to Denver and then take a taxi to the airport. Also, they want a hotel within 40 km of Denver's airport and attractions near that hotel.

Starting with the taxi to the airport. The user needs a taxi from the arena to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). I should use the Taxi_Search_Location tool to get the googlePlaceId for both the pickup (arena) and drop-off (airport). Wait, the user mentioned the airport in Denver, but the taxi is from Seattle. So first, find the airport in Seattle. Let me check: the airport code for Seattle is SEA. So I'll search for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport" to get its googlePlaceId. Then, the pickup location is the Climate Pledge Arena. I'll need to search for that as well. Once I have both place IDs, I can use the Search_Taxi tool to find the earliest taxi after 12 PM.

Next, the flight from Seattle to Denver. The user wants the earliest flight after the meeting ends. So I need to find the flight details. First, get the airport IDs for Seattle (from the previous search) and Denver. Denver's main airport is DEN. Using the Search_Flight_Location tool for "Denver" to get the toId. Then, use Search_Flights with fromId as SEA's ID, toId as DEN's ID, departDate as December 15, 2024. The user might want the earliest flight, so sorting by FASTEST or CHEAPEST? The user said "earliest flight," which likely refers to the earliest departure time, so sort by FASTEST. But the enum for sort includes BEST, CHEAPEST, FASTEST. Maybe FASTEST is the right choice here. Wait, the sort parameter's description says it orders by BEST, CHEAPEST, or FASTEST. So FASTEST would prioritize the earliest departure time. So set sort to FASTEST.

Then, after arriving in Denver, the user needs a hotel within 40 km of Denver's airport. First, find the airport in Denver (DEN) using Search_Flight_Location to get its ID. Then, use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the airport's coordinates. Wait, but the user might need the coordinates of the airport. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotel_Destination tool can find the hotel destination, but the user wants the hotel near the airport. So perhaps first get the coordinates of the airport using the Meta's locationToLatLong? Wait, the user might not have the coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the airport's location can be searched via Search_Hotel_Destination to get the latitude and longitude. For example, search for "Denver International Airport" to get its coordinates. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 40 km. But the user might need to first get the airport's coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires the latitude and longitude, which can be obtained via the Meta endpoint. But the user hasn't provided those. So perhaps first, use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Denver International Airport" to get the latitude and longitude. Then, use those in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival and departure dates. Wait, the user's arrival date is December 15, 2024, but the departure date for the hotel search would be the same day? Or maybe the user is staying overnight. The user's plan is to fly from Seattle to Denver after the meeting, so the arrival in Denver is on December 15, 2024. So the hotel would be for the night of the 15th, so arrival date is 15th, departure date would be the next day, but the user hasn't specified. Wait, the user's meeting is on the 15th, ends at 12 PM, then flies to Denver. So the flight is on the 15th, arriving in Denver, then staying there. So the hotel would be for the night of the 15th, so arrival date is 15th, departure date would be 16th. But the user hasn't specified the departure date from Denver. Maybe the user is staying for a few days, but the query doesn't mention. However, the user wants to check the hotel within 40 km of the airport and the attractions around it. So first, find the hotel near the airport. Once the hotel is found, then use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel's ID to get attractions.

Putting it all together:

1. Taxi from Climate Pledge Arena to SEA airport:
   - Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Climate Pledge Arena" to get pickup_place_id.
   - Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport" to get drop_off_place_id.
   - Use Search_Taxi with those IDs and pick_up_time as 12:00 PM, pick_up_date as 2024-12-15.

2. Flight from Seattle to Denver:
   - Use Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport" to get fromId.
   - Use Search_Flight_Location for "Denver International Airport" to get toId.
   - Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate 2024-12-15, sort by FASTEST.

3. Hotel near Denver airport:
   - Use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Denver International Airport" to get its coordinates (latitude and longitude).
   - Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-16 (assuming one night), radius 40 km, and the coordinates.

4. Attractions near the hotel:
   - Once the hotel's ID is obtained from the hotel search, use Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id.

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates for the hotel stay, so maybe the departure date is the same day as arrival? Or perhaps the user is staying overnight. Since the flight is on the 15th, arriving in Denver, the hotel would be for the night of the 15th, so arrival_date is 2024-12-15, departure_date is 2024-12-16. But the user might not have specified, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

Now, the steps in code would involve multiple API calls. However, the user's question requires me to call the tools in the correct order. Let's outline the necessary tool calls:

First, get the taxi details. So first, search for the pickup and drop-off locations.

Then, get the flight details.

Then, find the hotel near the Denver airport.

Then, get attractions near that hotel.

So the first tool call is Taxi_Search_Location for the pickup location (Climate Pledge Arena) and drop-off (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport). Wait, but the user is flying from Seattle to Denver, so the taxi is from Seattle to the airport. So the drop-off is the airport in Seattle, not Denver. So the taxi is from the arena to SEA airport. Then, after the meeting, take the taxi to the airport, then fly to Denver. So the taxi's drop-off is SEA airport.

So first, call Taxi_Search_Location for "Climate Pledge Arena" to get the pickup_place_id. Then, call Taxi_Search_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport" to get the drop_off_place_id. Then, use Search_Taxi with those IDs and the time.

Next, for the flight, need to get the fromId (Seattle airport) and toId (Denver airport). So use Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport" to get fromId, and for "Denver International Airport" to get toId. Then, call Search_Flights with those IDs, departDate 2024-12-15, sort by FASTEST.

Then, for the hotel in Denver, need to find the airport's coordinates. So use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Denver International Airport" to get its latitude and longitude. Then, use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, arrival_date 2024-12-15, departure_date 2024-12-16, radius 40 km.

Once the hotel is found, get its hotel_id, then call Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with that hotel_id.

So the tool calls in order would be:

1. Taxi_Search_Location for "Climate Pledge Arena"
2. Taxi_Search_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport"
3. Search_Taxi with the two place IDs and time
4. Search_Flight_Location for "Seattle-Tacoma International Airport"
5. Search_Flight_Location for "Denver International Airport"
6. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, sort
7. Search_Hotel_Destination for "Denver International Airport"
8. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with the coordinates, dates, radius
9. Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id

But the user's question requires me to call the tools in the correct order. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. So the initial step is to first get the taxi details. So the first tool call is Taxi_Search_Location
