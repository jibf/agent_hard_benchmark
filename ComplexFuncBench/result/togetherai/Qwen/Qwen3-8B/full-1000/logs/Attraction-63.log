Okay, let's see. The user asked about Sissi-themed attractions in Vienna under $60. The first result from the search was a 2-hour guided tour priced at $53.06, which is under 60. The details mention it includes the museum ticket and is bookable with free cancellation. Since it meets the price requirement, I should present this as the recommended option. I'll check if there are other options too, but since the first one is under 60, maybe that's the best choice. Need to make sure to mention the price, what's included, and the operator. Also, note the cancellation policy in case they need to change plans.
</think>

The **2-Hour Guided Tour in the Footsteps of Princess Sissi in Vienna** is available at **$53.06**, which is under your $60 budget. Here's the breakdown:

- **Includes**: Museum ticket (Hofburg Imperial Palace), skip-the-line access, and a guided tour focusing on Sissi's history and the Habsburg legacy.
- **What’s Covered**: Private guide, museum entry, and insights into the Imperial Palace’s history.
- **Cancellation Policy**: Free cancellation up to 24 hours before the tour.
- **Operator**: MarioViennaGuide (experienced local expert).

This seems like the best fit! Would you like help booking or checking alternatives? 😊
