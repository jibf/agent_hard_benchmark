Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user's friends are visiting Prague from November 10th to 15th, 2024. They need a hotel near the National Museum with a 24-hour front desk. Then, they want to find nearby cities for continued travel.

First, I need to find the National Museum in Prague. The user mentioned the National Museum, so I should use the Search Hotel Destination API to get the dest_id for Prague. Wait, but the National Museum is a specific location. Maybe the Search Hotel Destination API can handle that. Let me check the parameters. The query parameter can be a location name. So I'll call Search Hotel Destination with query "National Museum, Prague" to get the dest_id. Once I have that, I can proceed.

Next, the user wants a hotel near the National Museum. So after getting the dest_id, I can use the Search Hotels API. But the user also specified a 24-hour front desk. However, looking at the Search Hotels parameters, there's no direct filter for 24-hour front desk. Hmm, maybe that's a feature that's not covered in the provided tools. Wait, the parameters for Search Hotels include categories_filter, which can be retrieved via Get_Filter. But the user's requirement is specific. Maybe the categories_filter can include amenities like 24-hour front desk. But since the tools don't specify that, perhaps I need to proceed with the available parameters. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Filter API can provide possible categories, but the user hasn't mentioned that. Let me check the parameters again. The categories_filter is retrieved from Get_Filter, which requires search_type, dest_id, etc. But the user hasn't provided those yet. So maybe I need to first get the dest_id for Prague, then use that to get the categories_filter, which might include amenities. But the user's query is a bit complex. Let me break it down step by step.

First, find the dest_id for Prague. Use Search Hotel Destination with query "Prague" or "National Museum, Prague". Wait, the National Museum is in Prague, so maybe the dest_id for Prague is sufficient. But the user wants a hotel near the National Museum, so maybe the exact location is important. However, the Search Hotel Destination might return the city's dest_id. Let me proceed with that. So first, call Search Hotel Destination with query "National Museum, Prague" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in the Search Hotels API. But the user also wants a 24-hour front desk. Since the parameters for Search Hotels don't include a direct filter for that, maybe the categories_filter can include it. But without knowing the exact categories, perhaps the user's requirement can't be fully met. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Filter API can provide the available categories, which might include amenities. So after getting the dest_id, call Get_Filter with the necessary parameters to get the categories_filter, which might include the 24-hour front desk option. Then, use that in the Search Hotels API. But this is getting complicated. Let me check the parameters again.

Wait, the Search Hotels parameters include categories_filter, which is retrieved from Get_Filter. So the process would be: first, get the dest_id for Prague (or the National Museum), then call Get_Filter to get the categories_filter, which might include amenities. Then, in the Search Hotels, include the categories_filter with the relevant amenity. However, the user hasn't specified the exact categories, so maybe the initial step is to get the dest_id for Prague. Let me start with that.

So first, call Search Hotel Destination with query "Prague" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in the Search Hotels API. But the user wants a hotel near the National Museum. Maybe the Search Hotel Destination with "National Museum, Prague" would give a more accurate dest_id. Let me try that. So first, call Search Hotel Destination with query "National Museum, Prague" to get the dest_id. Then, proceed to Search Hotels with that dest_id, and include the necessary parameters like arrival and departure dates, adults, etc. Also, the user wants a 24-hour front desk. Since the categories_filter is needed, perhaps after getting the dest_id, call Get_Filter with the search_type (which would be retrieved from Search Hotel Destination?), but the search_type is a parameter that can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. Wait, the search_type parameter for Get_Filter is retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So maybe the process is:

1. Use Search Hotel Destination with query "National Museum, Prague" to get the dest_id and search_type.
2. Then, call Get_Filter with the search_type, dest_id, and other parameters to get the categories_filter, which might include amenities like 24-hour front desk.
3. Use the categories_filter in the Search Hotels API to filter for hotels with 24-hour front desk.

But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the National Museum is a specific location, and the Search Hotel Destination might not return a dest_id for that exact location. So perhaps the user needs to search for Prague as the city, and then the hotel near the National Museum would be within that city. So first, get the dest_id for Prague. Then, in the Search Hotels, specify the location as the National Museum. Wait, but the Search Hotels parameters don't have a location parameter. The parameters are arrival_date, departure_date, dest_id, etc. So maybe the dest_id for Prague is sufficient, and the National Museum is just a reference. But the user wants a hotel near the National Museum, so perhaps the Search Hotel Destination with "National Museum, Prague" would give a more accurate dest_id. However, the Search Hotel Destination's query parameter is for locations, cities, etc. So maybe the best approach is to first get the dest_id for Prague, then proceed to search hotels in that city, and then check if the National Museum is within the city's area. But the user might need a hotel near the museum, so perhaps the Search Hotels API can take a location parameter, but according to the provided tools, the Search Hotels API doesn't have a location parameter. It uses dest_id. So maybe the user's request is to find a hotel in Prague (dest_id) near the National Museum, which is a specific landmark. However, without a location parameter in the Search Hotels API, the best we can do is to search in the city (Prague) and then maybe the user can filter based on proximity. But the tools don't support that. So perhaps the user's request is to find a hotel in Prague (dest_id) and then find nearby cities. 

Alternatively, maybe the National Museum is a specific location, and the user wants a hotel near that. So first, get the coordinates of the National Museum using the Location to Lat Long API. Then, use Get Nearby Cities to find nearby cities. But the user's first step is to find a hotel near the National Museum. Wait, the tools don't have a direct way to search for hotels by proximity to a specific landmark. The Search Hotels API uses dest_id, which is a city or region. So perhaps the user's request is to find a hotel in Prague (dest_id) and then find nearby cities. 

So the steps would be:

1. Find the dest_id for Prague using Search Hotel Destination with query "Prague".
2. Use that dest_id in the Search Hotels API to find hotels in Prague, specifying the arrival and departure dates, adults, etc. But the user wants a 24-hour front desk. Since the Search Hotels parameters don't include that, maybe the categories_filter can include it. So after getting the dest_id, call Get_Filter to get the categories_filter, which might include amenities. Then, in the Search Hotels, include the categories_filter with the relevant amenity. However, the user hasn't specified the exact categories, so this might be a stretch. Alternatively, the user might have to proceed without that filter and then check the results manually. 

But given the tools available, the best approach is to first get the dest_id for Prague, then search for hotels in that city, and then proceed to find nearby cities using the Get Nearby Cities API. 

Wait, the user also wants to find other nearby cities around the hotel where they can continue their travel plans. So after finding the hotel in Prague, they need to find nearby cities. To do that, they would need the coordinates of the hotel. But the tools don't provide that. However, the Get Nearby Cities API requires longitude and latitude. So perhaps the user needs to first get the coordinates of the National Museum (or the hotel's location) using the Location to Lat Long API. But the user hasn't provided a location name for that. Alternatively, maybe the National Museum's coordinates can be obtained via the Location to Lat Long API with the query "National Museum, Prague". Then, use those coordinates in Get Nearby Cities to find nearby cities. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search Hotel Destination with query "National Museum, Prague" to get the dest_id for the location. Wait, but the Search Hotel Destination's query is for locations, cities, etc. Maybe the National Museum is a specific location, so the dest_id would be for Prague. Alternatively, the Search Hotel Destination might return the dest_id for the National Museum, but that's unlikely. So perhaps the user needs to search for Prague as the city. 

Alternatively, the user might need to first get the coordinates of the National Museum using the Location to Lat Long API. Then, use those coordinates in Get Nearby Cities to find nearby cities. 

But the user's first step is to find a hotel near the National Museum. So the process would be:
