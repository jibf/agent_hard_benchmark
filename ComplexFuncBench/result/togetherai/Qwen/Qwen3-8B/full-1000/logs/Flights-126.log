Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel from Chicago to Boston and Washington, staying 6 days each, then return to Chicago. They're unsure about the order (Boston first or Washington first) and want the cheapest flight departing around December 10th, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the possible itineraries. Since they can choose the order, I should consider both options: Chicago to Boston then Washington, and vice versa. But the user mentioned "return to Chicago," so the return trip would be from Washington to Chicago or Boston to Chicago, depending on the order.

But the user is asking for the departure date of the cheapest flight around Dec 10th. Wait, the departure date is the date they leave from Chicago. However, the return trip's date isn't specified yet. But the user hasn't decided the order, so maybe they want the cheapest round-trip option, considering both possible routes.

Wait, the user might be looking for a multi-stop flight. Since they're going to two cities, maybe they need a multi-leg journey. Let me check the available tools. There's Search_Flights_Multi_Stops which allows searching for multi-stop flights. Also, Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops could help find the minimum price for multi-stop flights.

But the user wants the departure date around Dec 10th. So perhaps the first leg is Chicago to Boston or Washington on or around Dec 10th, then the second leg to the other city, and the return trip. However, the user hasn't specified the return date, just the departure date. Maybe they want the cheapest departure date around Dec 10th, and the return date would be adjusted accordingly.

But the user's main request is to find the departure date of the cheapest flight around Dec 10th. So maybe they need to check both possible routes (Boston first or Washington first) and find the cheapest option. However, the tools available for multi-stop flights require specifying the legs. Let me think.

First, I need to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Boston, and Washington. The user might not know the exact airport codes, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airport IDs for each city. For example, Chicago's O'Hare is ORD, but the tool might return the correct ID.

Once I have the airport IDs, I can structure the legs for both possible routes:

1. Chicago to Boston, then Boston to Washington, then Washington to Chicago.
2. Chicago to Washington, then Washington to Boston, then Boston to Chicago.

But the user is staying 6 days in each place, so the return date would be after 12 days from the departure date. However, the user hasn't specified the return date, just the departure date around Dec 10th. So maybe the return trip is on a date that's 12 days after the departure date. But the user might not have specified that, so perhaps the return date is flexible, and the cheapest option would be found by checking both possible routes and their return dates.

But the user's main focus is on the departure date around Dec 10th. So the first step is to find the cheapest multi-stop flight for each possible route (Boston first or Washington first) departing around Dec 10th. Then, compare the prices and choose the cheaper one.

However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool can find the minimum price for multi-stop flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user wants the departure date around Dec 10th, maybe we can use that tool to get the minimum price for each route.

But the user also wants detailed information for that flight, which would require using Get_Flight_Details once we have the token from the search.

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the airport IDs for Chicago, Boston, and Washington.
2. For each possible route (Boston first or Washington first), create the legs for the multi-stop flight.
3. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the cheapest options for each route.
4. Compare the prices and select the cheaper one.
5. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token from the cheapest option to get detailed info.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe the return trip is part of the multi-stop. Wait, the user is going to Boston and Washington, staying 6 days each, then returning to Chicago. So the trip is Chicago -> Boston (6 days) -> Washington (6 days) -> Chicago. Or Chicago -> Washington (6 days) -> Boston (6 days) -> Chicago. So the multi-stop would have three legs: departure, middle, and return.

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool requires legs as an array of fromId, toId, and date. So for each possible route, the legs would be:

Route 1: Chicago to Boston (date around Dec 10th), Boston to Washington (date after 6 days), Washington to Chicago (date after 12 days).

Route 2: Chicago to Washington (date around Dec 10th), Washington to Boston (date after 6 days), Boston to Chicago (date after 12 days).

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe the return date is flexible. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool searches within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the user wants the departure date around Dec 10th, the query date would be Dec 10th, and the tool would find the cheapest flights within that window.

But the problem is that the return date is 12 days after the departure date. However, the tool might not account for that. Alternatively, the user might be looking for a round-trip with two stops, but the tools available are for multi-stop flights. So perhaps the user's trip is considered as a multi-stop flight with three legs: departure, middle, and return.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe the return date is the same as the departure date plus 12 days. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool might not handle that. Alternatively, the user might be looking for a round-trip with two legs (Chicago to Boston/Washington and back), but the user wants to visit both cities, so it's a multi-leg journey.

This is getting complicated. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user needs to find the cheapest departure date around Dec 10th. So the first leg is from Chicago to either Boston or Washington. Then, the second leg to the other city, and the return leg back to Chicago. The user is staying 6 days in each city, so the second leg would be 6 days after the first leg, and the return leg would be 6 days after the second leg. So the total trip duration is 12 days.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so the return date would be 12 days after the departure date. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool requires the legs to have specific dates. So for each possible route, the legs would be:

For Route 1 (Boston first):
- Leg 1: Chicago to Boston on Dec 10th
- Leg 2: Boston to Washington on Dec 16th (6 days later)
- Leg 3: Washington to Chicago on Dec 22nd (another 6 days)

For Route 2 (Washington first):
- Leg 1: Chicago to Washington on Dec 10th
- Leg 2: Washington to Boston on Dec 16th
- Leg 3: Boston to Chicago on Dec 22nd

But the user wants the departure date around Dec 10th, so the first leg's date is Dec 10th. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool might not allow specifying the return date, but it can search for the minimum price within a date range. However, the tool's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if the query date is Dec 10th, it would look for flights from Dec 5th to Dec 15th. But the user's trip requires specific dates for each leg, so this might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool to find the cheapest options for each route, specifying the legs with the dates. But the user hasn't specified the return date, so the return leg's date would be 12 days after the departure date. However, the user might not have that information, so the tool might not be able to handle that.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The user wants the departure date around Dec 10th, so the first leg is on or around that date. The return date would be 12 days later. So for each possible route, the legs would be:

Route 1:
- Leg 1: Chicago to Boston on Dec 10th
- Leg 2: Boston to Washington on Dec 16th
- Leg 3: Washington to Chicago on Dec 22nd

Route 2:
- Leg 1: Chicago to Washington on Dec 10th
- Leg 2: Washington to Boston on Dec 16th
- Leg 3: Boston to Chicago on Dec 22nd

But the user might not have specified the return date, so the return leg's date is fixed based on the departure date. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops tool might not handle this, as it requires the legs to be specified. So perhaps the user
