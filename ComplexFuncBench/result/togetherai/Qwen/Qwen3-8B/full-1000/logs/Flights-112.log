Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants their friend to fly from Tokyo to Los Angeles with a layover in London around January 10, 2025, and they need the cheapest multi-stop flight with no overnight layovers. Then, they want the seat map for that flight.

First, I need to figure out the right tools to use. The user mentioned multi-stop flights, so the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops API seems necessary. But they also want the cheapest option, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API could help find the minimum price. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. The user's query date is January 10, 2025, so the API would check dates from Jan 5 to Jan 15. But the user specified a layover in London, so the legs need to be Tokyo to London, then London to LA. But the user doesn't accept overnight layovers, so the layover in London should be during the day. 

Wait, the user's main request is to find the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight. So maybe first, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to find flights with the layover in London, then get the cheapest one. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API might be more efficient for finding the cheapest options. However, that API's parameters require legs, which are fromId, toId, and date. The user's query is around Jan 10, but the API checks a 5-day window. So maybe the user's intended departure is Jan 10, but the API will look for flights in that window. However, the user wants the layover in London, so the legs would be Tokyo to London on one date, then London to LA on another date. But the user's main departure date is around Jan 10, so maybe the first leg is on Jan 10, and the second leg is the next day, ensuring no overnight layover. 

But the user might not have specified exact dates, just the approximate date. So the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API would find the cheapest flights within the 5-day window. However, the user's main departure is around Jan 10, so the API's query date is Jan 10, 2025. The legs would need to be structured as Tokyo to London on a certain date, then London to LA on another date. But the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight. So first, I need to find the legs for Tokyo to London and then London to LA, ensuring that the layover isn't overnight. 

Wait, the user's query says "around January 10, 2025" with a layover in London. So the first leg is Tokyo to London, and the second leg is London to LA. The departure date is around Jan 10, so maybe the first leg is on Jan 10, and the second leg is on Jan 11, ensuring the layover is during the day. But the exact dates might vary. 

So first, I need to use the Search_Flight_Location API to get the fromId and toId for Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles. Because the legs require fromId and toId, which are obtained from the searchDestination endpoint. 

So step 1: Search for Tokyo's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Tokyo". Then search for London's airport ID with query "London", and Los Angeles with "Los Angeles". 

Once I have those IDs, I can structure the legs array for the multi-stop flight. The legs would be Tokyo to London on a certain date, then London to LA on another date. But the user wants the cheapest option, so maybe using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs and cabin class. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API requires the legs to be in the array. But the user hasn't specified the cabin class, so maybe default to ECONOMY. 

Wait, the user's main request is to find the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight. So first, I need to find the legs. But the user might not have the fromId and toId, so I need to get them first. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles to get their IDs. Then, use those IDs in the legs array. 

But the user's query is about the cheapest flight, so maybe the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is the right one here. However, that API's parameters require legs, which are fromId, toId, and date. The user's query is around Jan 10, but the API checks a 5-day window. So the legs would be Tokyo to London on a date between Jan 5 and Jan 15, then London to LA on another date in that window. But the user wants the departure dates of the flight, so the first leg's date would be the departure date. 

But the user's main departure is around Jan 10, so the first leg's date is likely around that. However, the API will find the cheapest options within the 5-day window. 

So the steps would be:

1. Get the fromId for Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use those IDs in the legs array for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, specifying the legs as Tokyo to London on a date (maybe Jan 10) and London to LA on another date (maybe Jan 11), ensuring no overnight layover.
3. The API will return the minimum price flights, which would include the dates.
4. Then, use the offerToken from the cheapest flight to get the seat map via Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might not have the fromId and toId, so the first step is necessary. 

Wait, the user's query says "depart from Tokyo to Los Angeles around January 10, 2025, with a layover in London". So the first leg is Tokyo to London, and the second leg is London to LA. The departure date is around Jan 10, so the first leg's date is Jan 10, and the second leg's date is Jan 11 (assuming a day layover). But the API's Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops would check dates within 5 days before and after the query date (Jan 10), so the legs could be on Jan 5 to Jan 15. However, the user wants the layover in London to not be overnight, so the layover should be during the day. So the first leg's date is Jan 10, and the second leg's date is Jan 11. 

But the user might not have specified exact dates, so the API will find the cheapest options within the 5-day window. 

So first, I need to get the fromId and toId for Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles. Then, structure the legs array with the first leg as Tokyo to London on a date (maybe Jan 10) and the second leg as London to LA on another date (maybe Jan 11). 

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API requires the legs array. So the parameters would be:

legs: [
  { fromId: Tokyo's ID, toId: London's ID, date: '2025-01-10' },
  { fromId: London's ID, toId: LA's ID, date: '2025-01-11' }
]

But the user might not have specified the exact dates, so the API will look for flights in the 5-day window. However, the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest flight, so the API will return the dates. 

Once the cheapest flight is found, the offerToken is needed for the seat map. 

So the first step is to get the fromId and toId for the locations. Then, use those in the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API. 

But the user's query is about the cheapest flight, so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is the right choice. However, the user might need to first get the fromId and toId. 

So the first tool call should be Search_Flight_Location for Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles. 

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact cities, so the query is "Tokyo", "London", and "Los Angeles". 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Tokyo" to get the fromId for Tokyo. Then, same for London and Los Angeles. 

Once those IDs are obtained, then call Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array. 

But the user's query is about the cheapest flight, so the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API is the right one. 

But the user also wants the seat map for the flight, which requires the offerToken from the flight search. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for Tokyo's airport ID.
2. Search for London's airport ID.
3. Search for Los Angeles's airport ID.
4. Use those IDs in the legs array for Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops.
5. Get the cheapest flight's offerToken.
6. Use Get_Seat_Map with that offerToken.

But the user might not have the fromId and toId, so the first three steps are necessary. 

However, the user's query is about the cheapest flight, so the first step is to get the fromId and toId, then proceed. 

So the first tool
