Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to plan a trip starting from Toronto on September 15th, 2024, going to Mexico City and Lima, then returning to Toronto on September 29th. They'll stay in each city for a week. They need economy class flights, detailed info, and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey is Toronto to Mexico City, then Mexico City to Lima, and the return trip from Lima back to Toronto. Wait, the user mentioned leaving from Toronto on the 15th and returning on the 29th. So the outbound legs are Toronto to Mexico City on the 15th, then Mexico City to Lima. The return trip would be Lima to Toronto on the 29th. But the user said they'll stay in each city for a week, so maybe the return date is the 29th, which is 14 days after the 15th. That makes sense for a week in each city.

Next, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. The parameters required are adults, legs, cabinClass, sort, and children. The user didn't specify the number of adults or children, so I'll assume adults is 1 and children is 0 unless more info is given. The legs array needs each leg's fromId, toId, and date. But first, I need the location IDs for Toronto, Mexico City, and Lima. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help get those IDs based on the city names.

So first step: call Search_Flight_Location for each city. For Toronto, query "Toronto". For Mexico City, "Mexico City", and for Lima, "Lima". That will get the respective IDs. Then, use those IDs in the legs array for the multi-stop search. The legs would be:

1. From Toronto's ID to Mexico City's ID on 2024-09-15
2. From Mexico City's ID to Lima's ID on 2024-09-22 (since they stay a week in Mexico City, departing on the 22nd)
3. Return leg from Lima's ID to Toronto's ID on 2024-09-29

Wait, the user said they'll stay in each city for a week. So leaving Toronto on 15th, arriving in Mexico City. Then staying there until the 22nd (a week), then flying to Lima on the 22nd, staying there until the 29th, then returning. So the return flight is on the 29th. So the legs for the outbound are two legs: Toronto to Mexico City on 15th, Mexico City to Lima on 22nd. The return leg is Lima to Toronto on 29th. So the legs array has three entries.

But the user's return date is the 29th, so the return flight would be from Lima to Toronto on that date. So the legs for the multi-stop search would be three legs: outbound first leg, second leg, then return leg. Wait, but the multi-stop search is for a single journey. Wait, the user is making a round trip with two stops. So the outbound is two legs (Toronto to Mexico City to Lima), and the return is one leg (Lima to Toronto). But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights in one direction. So maybe the user needs to search for two separate multi-stop flights: one for the outbound (Toronto to Mexico City to Lima) and another for the return (Lima to Toronto). But the user's query is about the entire journey, so perhaps the tool can handle multiple legs in one search. Let me check the tool's description again.

The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool's legs parameter is an array of legs, each with fromId, toId, and date. So for the outbound trip, the legs would be:

Leg 1: Toronto to Mexico City on 2024-09-15

Leg 2: Mexico City to Lima on 2024-09-22 (since they stay a week in Mexico City, departing on the 22nd)

Then the return trip would be a separate search with legs:

Leg 1: Lima to Toronto on 2024-09-29

But the user might need to book both the outbound and return trips. However, the user's query is about the entire journey, so maybe the assistant should first find the outbound multi-stop flight and then the return flight. But the user might be looking for a round-trip with two stops. However, the tool's description says "multi-stop Flights" which could be a single journey with multiple stops. But the return trip is a separate journey. So perhaps the assistant needs to make two separate searches: one for the outbound (Toronto to Mexico City to Lima) and another for the return (Lima to Toronto). But the user might not have specified the return date, but they mentioned returning on the 29th. So the return leg is from Lima to Toronto on 2024-09-29.

But the user's initial request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey, including detailed info and seat maps. So the first step is to get the location IDs for each city. Then, perform the multi-stop search for the outbound and return trips. However, the tool might not handle round-trip multi-stop in one call. So perhaps two separate calls: one for the outbound (two legs) and one for the return (one leg). But the user might need to book both. However, the user's query is about the entire journey, so the assistant should first find the outbound and return flights.

But the user's message says "help us find the best economy class flights for this journey", which includes the entire trip. So the assistant needs to handle both the outbound and return. However, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for a single journey. So the outbound is a multi-stop flight (Toronto to Mexico City to Lima), and the return is a single leg (Lima to Toronto). Therefore, two separate searches: one for the outbound multi-stop and one for the return single leg. But the user might not have specified the return date, but they did mention returning on the 29th. So the return leg is on that date.

But the user's message says they'll return on the 29th, so the return flight is from Lima to Toronto on 2024-09-29. So the assistant needs to first get the location IDs for each city, then perform the outbound multi-stop search, then the return single leg search. Then, for each flight found, get the details and seat maps.

But the user might not have specified the number of adults or children. The default for adults is 1, and children is 0. So the parameters would be adults: 1, children: 0, cabinClass: ECONOMY, sort: BEST. The user wants the best economy class flights, so sort by BEST.

So the steps are:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the IDs for Toronto, Mexico City, and Lima.

2. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound trip (Toronto to Mexico City to Lima) with the dates 2024-09-15 and 2024-09-22.

3. Use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the return trip (Lima to Toronto) on 2024-09-29.

Wait, but the return trip is a single leg, so maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool can handle that as well. The legs array can have one leg for the return. So the return trip would be a single leg from Lima to Toronto on 2024-09-29.

But the user might need to book both the outbound and return. So the assistant needs to perform two separate searches. However, the user's query is about the entire journey, so the assistant should first get the location IDs, then perform the outbound and return searches.

But the user might not have specified the number of adults or children, so the assistant should assume default values unless told otherwise. The user mentioned "our company", which might imply multiple people, but since they didn't specify, the assistant should proceed with the default of 1 adult and 0 children.

So the first tool call is to Search_Flight_Location for each city. Then, using those IDs, perform the multi-stop search for the outbound and return trips. Then, for each flight found, get the details and seat maps.

But the user's initial request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey, so the assistant needs to first get the location IDs, then perform the searches, then retrieve details and seat maps.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto, Mexico City, and Lima. Then, use those IDs in the multi-stop search for the outbound and return legs. Then, for each flight, get the details and seat maps.

But the user might not have specified the exact dates for the legs. The outbound legs are on 2024-09-15 and 2024-09-22. The return leg is on 2024-09-29.

So the assistant needs to make three tool calls: first, get the location IDs, then search for the outbound multi-stop, then search for the return single leg. Then, for each flight, get details and seat maps.
