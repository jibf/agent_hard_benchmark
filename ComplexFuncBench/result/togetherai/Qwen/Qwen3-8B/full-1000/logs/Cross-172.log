2025-08-15 00:14:20,559 - evaluation_logger_Cross-172 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for attractions near the Lestel Maru hotel in Sapporo. I used the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool with the hotel_id 6374805 and got a response with Hokkaido Shrine as the closest landmark. Now, I need to provide detailed descriptions of this attraction.

First, I should check if there's a tool to get more details about the attraction. Looking at the available tools, there's Get_Attraction_Details which requires a slug. The previous response didn't provide a slug, just the name "Hokkaido Shrine". 

Wait, maybe the Search_Attraction_Location tool can help get the slug. But the user already got the name from the nearby attractions. Alternatively, maybe the details can be inferred from existing knowledge. Since the tools don't provide additional data beyond the initial response, I might need to rely on known information about Hokkaido Shrine.

Hokkaido Shrine is a famous site in Sapporo, known for its historical significance and beautiful architecture. It's a popular spot for visitors, especially during the flower festivals. The shrine's main hall, the Yuih≈çden, is a key attraction. The surrounding area has gardens and is a place for cultural experiences. 

Since the tool response only gave the name, distance, and average rating, I can't get more details through the provided APIs. So, I'll use the available information and add general knowledge about the shrine to describe it. I should mention its location, historical background, and why it's a popular attraction. Also, note the high rating to highlight its appeal. 

I need to make sure the answer is helpful and informative, even without the slug. Maybe suggest visiting the shrine for its cultural and historical value, and mention the nearby areas if possible. Since the user wants detailed descriptions, I'll elaborate on what the shrine offers and its significance.
