2025-08-15 01:01:24,164 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-25 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about Westminster Abbey. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with the query "Westminster Abbey" to find relevant products. The response gave a product slug for a private tour. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to get the detailed info.

Now, looking at the tool response, there's a lot of data. The user might want a concise summary. Let me extract key points: the description mentions its historical significance, notable events, and features like the coronation chair and galleries. The additional info includes accessibility details and what's included in the tour. The price is $565.39 USD. I should present this info clearly, highlighting the history, tour details, and practical info like cancellation policy and what's included. Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and informative.
