2025-08-15 01:02:20,293 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-21 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked for detailed information about the Arc de Triomphe after seeing it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with the query "Arc de Triomphe" to find relevant attractions. The response gave a product slug for a private guided tour. Then, I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug to get the detailed info.

Now, looking at the tool response, there's a lot of data. The user probably wants a concise summary of what the tour includes, any important policies, and maybe pricing. Let me check the description and key points. The tour is 2 hours, includes a guide, access to the rooftop, and panoramic views. The cancellation policy allows free cancellation, which is good. But there are some restrictions: stairs to the terrace, not wheelchair accessible, and the user must be 18 or accompanied by an adult. Also, the price is $410.38 USD. I should present this info clearly, highlighting the key features and any important notes. Make sure to mention the included items, what's not included, and the cancellation policy. Also, note the age requirement and accessibility info. The user might be planning a trip, so practical details like the location in Paris and the need for a ticket are important. Avoid technical jargon and keep it friendly.
