2025-08-15 00:05:25,090 - evaluation_logger_Cross-131 - INFO - Query: Help me check the details of the fastest plane tickets from Toronto to Los Angeles on November 15, 2024, and from Los Angeles to San Francisco on November 17, 2024. I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in Los Angeles and San Francisco for two days each. Please provide hotels within 10 kilometers of the related airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want the fastest plane tickets from Toronto to LA on November 15, 2024, and then from LA to San Francisco on November 17, 2024. They also need hotels near the airports in LA and SF based on the arrival airports.

Starting with the flights. The user mentioned "fastest" so I should use the Search_Flights endpoint with sort parameter set to FASTEST. But I need the fromId and toId for both routes. The user provided city names, so I need to get the airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location. Let me check the parameters for that endpoint. The query parameter can be the city name, like "Toronto" and "Los Angeles" for the first flight, then "Los Angeles" to "San Francisco" for the second. Once I have the airport IDs, I can call Search_Flights with the appropriate parameters.

Wait, the user wants the fastest flights, so for each leg, I'll need to make two separate calls to Search_Flights. The first flight is Toronto to LA on 2024-11-15, and the second is LA to SF on 2024-11-17. Each requires fromId and toId. So first, I need to get the airport IDs for Toronto, LA, and SF. Let me structure that.

Next, after getting the flight details, the user wants hotels within 10 km of the arrival airports. For that, I need the coordinates of the airports. The Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates requires latitude and longitude. So after getting the airport IDs, I should use the Get_Flight_Details endpoint to get the airport information, but wait, the Get_Flight_Details requires a token from the Search_Flights. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location can give the airport's coordinates? Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint returns location details, but maybe the airport's coordinates are in the response. Alternatively, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long can be used with the airport's name. Hmm, but the user might need the exact airport's coordinates. Let me think.

Wait, the user wants hotels near the arrival airports. So for the first flight, arriving in LA, I need the coordinates of LA's airport (probably LAX). Similarly for SF, the airport is SFO. But maybe the user is referring to the arrival airport's location. So perhaps after getting the flight details, the arrival airport's code can be used to get its coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location can be used with the airport's name to get its ID, then use Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. But the user might not have the airport codes. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location can be used with the city name to get the airport's ID, then use that to get the coordinates. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location's query parameter is the airport name, city, etc. So for example, querying "Los Angeles" might return the airport's ID. Then, using that ID, perhaps the Location_to_Lat_Long can be used? Wait, no, the Location_to_Lat_Long takes a query parameter which is the location name, not an ID. So maybe the process is: for each airport (LA and SF), use Search_Flight_Location with the city name to get the airport's ID, then use that ID to get the coordinates? Wait, no, the Search_Flight_Location's response might include the airport's coordinates. Let me check the endpoint description. The Search_Flight_Location's description says it finds airports by location, address, etc., so the response might include the airport's details, including coordinates. But the parameters for Search_Flight_Location are just a query string. So for example, if I query "Los Angeles", it might return the airport's ID, and then I can use that ID in the Search_Flights endpoint. Wait, the Search_Flights requires fromId and toId, which are the airport's location IDs. So the process would be:

1. For the first flight (Toronto to LA), use Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get the fromId, and "Los Angeles" to get the toId.
2. Then call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate as 2024-11-15, sort by FASTEST.
3. Similarly for the second flight (LA to SF), get the fromId (LA's airport ID) and toId (SF's airport ID) using Search_Flight_Location.
4. Then call Search_Flights again for the second leg.

Once the flight details are obtained, the user needs hotels near the arrival airports. For the first flight arriving in LA, the arrival airport is LAX. So I need the coordinates of LAX. To get that, perhaps use the Location_to_Lat_Long endpoint with query "Los Angeles International Airport" or "LAX". Similarly for SFO. Alternatively, if the Search_Flight_Location returns the airport's coordinates, that would be better. But the endpoint description for Search_Flight_Location says it returns the location's ID, which is used in Search_Flights. So maybe after getting the toId for LA, I can use that to get the airport's name, then use that in Location_to_Lat_Long. But that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location can be used with the airport's name to get its coordinates. Let me think.

Alternatively, once the flight details are retrieved, the Get_Flight_Details endpoint can provide more information, including the airport's details. But the Get_Flight_Details requires a token from the Search_Flights. So after getting the token from the first Search_Flights call, I can call Get_Flight_Details to get the flight's details, which might include the arrival airport's information. But the user's main goal is to get the fastest flights and then hotels near the arrival airports. So perhaps after getting the flight details, the arrival airport's code (like LAX) can be used to get the coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long. For example, for the first flight arriving in LA, the arrival airport is LAX. So query "LAX" in Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. Then use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 10 km. Similarly for SF's SFO.

But the user might not know the airport codes. So maybe the process is:

For each arrival airport (LA and SF), use Search_Flight_Location with the city name to get the airport's ID, then use that ID to get the airport's name (if possible), then use that name in Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. However, the Search_Flight_Location's response might not include the airport's name, only the ID. So perhaps the user needs to use the city name in Location_to_Lat_Long. Alternatively, maybe the airport's name can be inferred from the city. For example, Los Angeles's main airport is LAX, so querying "Los Angeles" in Location_to_Lat_Long might return the coordinates of LAX. Similarly for San Francisco's SFO.

So the steps would be:

1. For the first flight (Toronto to LA):
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get fromId.
   b. Use Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get toId.
   c. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate 2024-11-15, sort FASTEST.
   d. Get the token from the Search_Flights response.
   e. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get flight details, which might include arrival airport info (but not sure if that's necessary).
   f. For the arrival airport (LA), use Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Los Angeles" to get coordinates.
   g. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date 2024-11-15, departure_date 2024-11-17, radius 10, latitude and longitude from step f.

Wait, but the user wants hotels in LA and SF based on the arrival airports. So for the first flight arriving in LA, the hotel should be near LA's airport. For the second flight arriving in SF, the hotel should be near SF's airport. So the process is:

After getting the flight details for each leg, determine the arrival airport's coordinates, then use those to search for hotels.

But the user might not have the airport codes. So perhaps the best approach is to use the city names in the Location_to_Lat_Long endpoint to get the coordinates of the airports. For example, "Los Angeles" would return the coordinates of LAX, and "San Francisco" would return SFO's coordinates.

So, the steps would be:

1. Search for flight from Toronto to LA on 2024-11-15, sorted by FASTEST.
   - Need fromId (Toronto's airport ID) and toId (LA's airport ID).
   - Use Search_Flight_Location for "Toronto" and "Los Angeles" to get the IDs.
2. Once the flight details are retrieved, get the arrival airport's coordinates (LA) via Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Los Angeles".
3. Search hotels near LA's airport (coordinates from step 2) for arrival on 2024-11-15 and departure on 2024-11-17, radius 10 km.
4. Repeat for the second flight from LA to SF on 2024-11-17:
   - Get fromId (LA's
