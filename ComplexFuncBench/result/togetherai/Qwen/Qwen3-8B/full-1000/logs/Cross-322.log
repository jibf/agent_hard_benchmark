Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They need to find the cheapest connecting flights from Miami to Stanford and MIT, with a four-day stay at each. Also, they want to rent a car at each destination. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the flights. The user is leaving Miami on November 20th, 2024, and needs to go to Stanford University and MIT in sequence. Wait, the user says "give speeches at Stanford University and MIT in sequence." So the first leg is Miami to Stanford, then Stanford to MIT. But the user is leaving Miami on the 20th. So the first flight is Miami to Stanford on the 20th. Then, after staying four days at Stanford (so until November 24th), they need to fly to MIT. The departure date from Stanford would be November 24th, and then stay four days at MIT until November 28th. But the user might need to check the exact dates for the flights. However, the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe they just need the flights for the two legs: Miami to Stanford on 20th, and Stanford to MIT on 24th. But the user might need to return from MIT, but the query doesn't mention that. Let me check again. The user says they are leaving Miami on November 20th to give speeches at Stanford and MIT in sequence. So the trip is Miami -> Stanford -> MIT. They stay four days at each, so the flights would be on the 20th (departure from Miami), then on the 24th (departure from Stanford to MIT), and then maybe a return flight from MIT, but the user hasn't mentioned that. The user's main request is for the flights and car rentals for the two legs.

So for the flights, the user needs to find the cheapest connecting flights from Miami to Stanford, then Stanford to MIT. The user also wants to rent a car at each destination. For each destination (Stanford and MIT), they need to rent a car. The car rental details: pick up at the airport one hour after landing, return two hours before the next flight. So for the first leg, Miami to Stanford: the flight lands, then pick up the car one hour later. Then, when leaving Stanford for MIT, return the car two hours before the flight departs. Similarly for MIT, after the speech, they need to return the car two hours before the flight back? Wait, the user hasn't mentioned a return flight. Wait, the user says they are leaving Miami on November 20th to give speeches at Stanford and MIT. So the trip is one-way? Or is there a return? The user might need to return from MIT, but the query isn't clear. However, the user's main request is for the flights and car rentals for the two legs: Miami to Stanford, then Stanford to MIT. So maybe the user is only going to MIT and not returning, but that's unclear. However, the user might have a return flight, but since it's not mentioned, perhaps we should focus on the outbound legs. But the user might need to return, so maybe the user is planning a round trip. However, the initial query says "leaving Miami on November 20th" and "give speeches at Stanford and MIT in sequence." So the trip is from Miami to Stanford to MIT, and then perhaps back? But the user hasn't specified. Since the user hasn't mentioned a return date, maybe we should focus on the outbound flights. However, the car rentals would be needed at each destination. So for each destination (Stanford and MIT), they need to rent a car. So the first step is to find the flight from Miami to Stanford on November 20th, then from Stanford to MIT on November 24th. Then, for each of those destinations, find car rentals.

But to find the flights, we need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. Wait, the user is making two legs: Miami to Stanford, then Stanford to MIT. So that's a multi-stop flight? Or two separate flights. The user is giving speeches at each university, so the flights are two separate legs. However, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, which might be a single flight with multiple stops. But in this case, the user is making two separate flights. So maybe the user is looking for two separate flights, not a multi-stop flight. Wait, the user is leaving Miami on November 20th, then after four days at Stanford (so departing on November 24th), then flying to MIT. So the two legs are Miami to Stanford (Nov 20) and Stanford to MIT (Nov 24). So these are two separate flights. Therefore, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool might not be the right one here. Wait, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, which are flights with multiple stops. But in this case, the user is making two separate flights. So perhaps the user needs to search for two separate flights. However, the user might be looking for a multi-stop flight from Miami to MIT via Stanford, but that's not clear. The user says "connecting flights," which could imply a single flight with stops, but the way the query is phrased, it's more likely two separate flights. However, the user might want the cheapest connecting flights, which could be a single flight from Miami to MIT with a stop at Stanford. But the user is giving speeches at both Stanford and MIT, so they need to land at Stanford, stay there, then fly to MIT. Therefore, the flights are two separate legs. So the user needs to find the cheapest flights for each leg. However, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, which might not be applicable here. Alternatively, the user might need to search for two separate flights. But the available tools don't have a tool for searching individual flights. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, which are flights with multiple stops. So perhaps the user is looking for a multi-stop flight from Miami to MIT with a stop at Stanford. But the user's requirement is to give speeches at both Stanford and MIT, which would require landing at Stanford, staying there, then flying to MIT. Therefore, the flights are two separate legs. However, the user might not need a multi-stop flight but two separate flights. But the available tools don't have a way to search for individual flights. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights. So perhaps the user is looking for a multi-stop flight from Miami to MIT with a stop at Stanford. But the user's requirement is to have a stop at Stanford, then proceed to MIT. So the multi-stop flight would be Miami -> Stanford -> MIT. But the user is giving speeches at Stanford and MIT, so they need to land at Stanford, stay there, then fly to MIT. Therefore, the multi-stop flight would be appropriate here. So the user is looking for a multi-stop flight from Miami to MIT with a stop at Stanford. Therefore, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is the right one here. The user wants the cheapest connecting flights, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST". 

So the first step is to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. The parameters required are legs, which is an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date. The legs would be: first leg from Miami to Stanford on November 20th, then from Stanford to MIT on November 24th. Wait, but the user is staying four days at each city. So the first flight is on November 20th, arriving at Stanford. Then, they stay four days, so the next flight departs on November 24th from Stanford to MIT. So the legs would be:

Leg 1: fromId (Miami's airport ID), toId (Stanford's airport ID), date: 2024-11-20

Leg 2: fromId (Stanford's airport ID), toId (MIT's airport ID), date: 2024-11-24

But the user might need to check the airport codes for Stanford and MIT. Wait, the user is giving speeches at Stanford University and MIT. So the airports would be the nearest airports to those locations. For example, Stanford University is in Palo Alto, so the airport might be SFO (San Francisco International Airport) or SJC (San Jose International Airport). Similarly, MIT is in Cambridge, MA, so the airport would be BOS (Boston Logan International Airport) or JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport). But the user hasn't specified the exact airports, so we need to first find the airport IDs for Stanford and MIT using the Search_Flight_Location tool. 

So the process would be:

1. Find the airport IDs for Miami (departure), Stanford University (arrival), and MIT (next arrival). 

Wait, the user is leaving Miami, so the departure airport is Miami's airport. The first leg is Miami to Stanford. So we need to find the airport ID for Stanford University. Similarly, the second leg is from Stanford to MIT, so we need the airport ID for MIT. 

But the user hasn't specified the exact airports, so we need to search for the airports near Stanford University and MIT. So first, use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airports near Stanford University and MIT. 

So step 1: Search for airports near Stanford University. 

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Stanford University" to get the airport IDs. 

Similarly, search for airports near MIT with query "MIT"
