Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they need to book a multi-stop flight from Sydney to Brisbane, then Brisbane to Osaka, and they want the fastest flights. Then, they need to check the availability of the Hilton Hotel Brisbane for those dates. Also, arrange a taxi from the hotel to the airport three hours before the flight on the 12th.

Starting with the flights. The user mentioned two legs: Sydney to Brisbane on November 10, 2024, and then Brisbane to Osaka two days later, which would be November 12, 2024. Wait, two days after November 10 is November 12, so the second flight is on the 12th. The user wants the fastest flights, so the sort parameter should be "FASTEST". 

Looking at the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool, the legs array needs fromId, toId, and date. So first, I need to get the airport IDs for Sydney and Brisbane for the first leg. Then for Brisbane to Osaka, I need the airport ID for Brisbane and Osaka. But wait, the user is flying from Brisbane to Osaka, so the fromId would be Brisbane's airport ID, and toId would be Osaka's airport ID. However, the user hasn't specified the exact airport in Brisbane, but the Hilton Hotel is in Brisbane, so maybe the airport is Brisbane Airport (BNE). But the user might be using the city code, so I need to check if the Search_Flight_Location tool can get the airport IDs. 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint is for finding airports by location. So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location for Sydney to get the fromId for the first leg. Then for Brisbane, get the fromId for the second leg's departure. For Osaka, I need to get the toId. But the user might not have specified the exact airport in Osaka, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location for Osaka. 

But the user hasn't provided the airport codes, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airport IDs. Let me outline the steps:

1. Search for Sydney's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Search for Brisbane's airport ID (since the user is departing from Brisbane, maybe the same as the first leg's arrival? Wait, the first leg is Sydney to Brisbane, so the second leg is Brisbane to Osaka. So the fromId for the second leg is Brisbane's airport ID. So I need to get that.
3. Search for Osaka's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location.
4. Then, use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool with the legs array containing both legs, sorted by FASTEST.

But the user hasn't provided the exact airports, so I need to make these searches first. However, the user might be assuming that the airports are the main ones. For example, Sydney Airport is SYD, Brisbane is BNE, and Osaka is KIX. But the tool requires the IDs, which might be different. So I need to call the Search_Flight_Location for each city to get the correct IDs.

Wait, the user's first leg is from Sydney to Brisbane. So the first leg's fromId is Sydney's airport ID, toId is Brisbane's airport ID. The second leg's fromId is Brisbane's airport ID, toId is Osaka's airport ID. So I need to get these IDs via the Search_Flight_Location tool.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Sydney" to get the fromId for the first leg's departure. Then call Search_Flight_Location for "Brisbane" to get the fromId for the second leg's departure. Then call Search_Flight_Location for "Osaka" to get the toId for the second leg's arrival. 

Once I have these IDs, I can structure the legs array. The dates are November 10, 2024, and November 12, 2024. The sort is FASTEST. The adults are probably 1, unless specified, but the user didn't mention, so default to 1. 

Next, the hotel availability. The user wants to stay at the Hilton Hotel Brisbane from November 10 to 12. Wait, the user says they'll travel on the 10th, stay in Brisbane, and then fly on the 12th. So arrival is November 10, departure is November 12. So the check-in is on the 10th, check-out on the 12th. 

To check hotel availability, I need to use the Get_Room_List_With_Availability tool. But first, I need the hotel_id. The user mentioned the Hilton Hotel Brisbane. To get the hotel_id, I need to search for the hotel using the Search_Hotels tool. However, the Search_Hotels requires parameters like search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, etc. 

Wait, the user has already specified the hotel name, so maybe first use the Search_Hotels tool with the search_type as the destination (Brisbane), and query for Hilton Hotel Brisbane. But the Search_Hotels tool requires parameters like search_type, which can be retrieved from the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the Search_Hotels tool with the search_type as the destination (Brisbane) and the query as "Hilton Hotel Brisbane". But the parameters for Search_Hotels include search_type, which is retrieved from the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can first call Search_Hotel_Destination for Brisbane to get the dest_id, then use that in the Search_Hotels tool. But the user's request is to check availability of the Hilton Hotel Brisbane. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination for "Brisbane" to get the dest_id.
2. Use Search_Hotels with search_type as the destination, arrival_date as 2024-11-10, departure_date as 2024-11-12, and query for Hilton Hotel Brisbane. But the Search_Hotels tool's parameters include search_type, which is the destination type, and the query might be the hotel name. However, the parameters for Search_Hotels include 'search_type' which is retrieved from the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can use the Search_Hotels tool with the search_type as the destination (Brisbane), and the query as "Hilton Hotel Brisbane". But the parameters for Search_Hotels include 'search_type' which is a parameter that needs to be retrieved from the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Brisbane" to get the search_type. Then use that in the Search_Hotels tool. 

But the user's main goal is to check the availability of the Hilton Hotel Brisbane. So perhaps the steps are:

- Call Search_Hotel_Destination for "Brisbane" to get the dest_id and search_type.
- Then call Search_Hotels with search_type, arrival_date, departure_date, and query for "Hilton Hotel Brisbane" to get the hotel_id.
- Then use Get_Room_List_With_Availability with the hotel_id, arrival_date, departure_date, etc.

But the user might not have provided the exact parameters, so I need to structure the tool calls accordingly. 

Additionally, the user needs a taxi from the hotel to the airport on the 12th, three hours before the flight. So first, the taxi needs the pick-up location (hotel) and drop-off location (airport). To get the googlePlaceId for the hotel, the user might need to use the Taxi_Search_Location tool with the hotel's address. But the user hasn't provided the hotel's address, only the name. So perhaps the user can search for the hotel's location using the Taxi_Search_Location tool with "Hilton Hotel Brisbane" to get the googlePlaceId. Then, the drop-off location is Brisbane Airport, which can be found using the Taxi_Search_Location tool for "Brisbane Airport" to get its googlePlaceId. 

So the steps for the taxi are:

1. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Hilton Hotel Brisbane" to get the pick_up_place_id.
2. Use Taxi_Search_Location for "Brisbane Airport" to get the drop_off_place_id.
3. Then, use Search_Taxi with these place_ids, the pick_up_date as 2024-11-12, and pick_up_time as three hours before the flight's departure time. However, the flight's departure time isn't specified, so this might be a problem. The user hasn't provided the flight's departure time, so the taxi's pick_up_time would need to be three hours before the flight's scheduled time. But without knowing the flight's time, this is tricky. However, the user might expect that the taxi is arranged for the flight's departure time, so perhaps the user will provide that later, but in the current query, the user hasn't specified. 

But the user's request is to arrange the taxi, so maybe the tool call can be made with the pick_up_time as three hours before the flight's departure. However, since the flight's departure time isn't known yet, this might not be possible. But the user might have the flight details, so perhaps the taxi can be arranged once the flight is booked. However, the user hasn't provided the flight's time, so this might be an issue. 

But the user's main request is to check the hotel availability and arrange the taxi. So perhaps the taxi can be arranged once the flight details are known,
