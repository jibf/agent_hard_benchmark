Okay, let's break down the user's query step by step. They want to plan a trip starting from Boston on December 10th, 2024, going to Barcelona, staying for four days, then to Perth, and returning to Boston on December 24th. They're looking for the cheapest premium economy flights. But if the Barcelona to Perth flights are over $1800, they'll skip Barcelona and check direct round-trip flights from Boston to Perth instead.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs involved. The trip has three parts: Boston to Barcelona, Barcelona to Perth, and Perth back to Boston. But the user's condition complicates things. If the Barcelona to Perth flight is too expensive, they'll bypass Barcelona entirely. So, the main steps are:

1. Find the cheapest premium economy flights from Boston to Barcelona on December 10th.
2. Check the cheapest premium economy flights from Barcelona to Perth, departing on December 14th (since they stay four days in Barcelona, leaving on the 14th).
3. Find the return flights from Perth to Boston on December 24th.
4. If the Barcelona to Perth flight exceeds $1800, then check direct round-trip Boston to Perth flights for the same dates.

But the user's main concern is the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg. So, the first thing is to get the minimum price for that leg. However, the user mentioned "multi-stop flights" in their initial request, so maybe they're considering multi-stop options. Wait, the user specifically says "cheapest premium economy flights for this time period," which includes the entire journey. But the condition is about the Barcelona to Perth leg.

Wait, the user's exact words: "If the ticket price is over 1800 dollars, we won't stay in Barcelona. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Boston to Perth during this time." So the $1800 is for the Barcelona to Perth flight. So the user is considering the cost of the Barcelona to Perth flight. If that's over 1800, they'll skip Barcelona and go directly from Boston to Perth.

But how do I determine the cost of the Barcelona to Perth flight? The user's trip is Boston to Barcelona (depart Dec 10), stay 4 days (so leave Barcelona on Dec 14), then Perth, then return to Boston on Dec 24. So the Barcelona to Perth flight would depart on Dec 14, and the return flight from Perth to Boston would be on Dec 24.

So first, I need to get the minimum price for the Barcelona to Perth flight on Dec 14th in premium economy. Then check if it's over 1800. If yes, then check the direct Boston to Perth round-trip flights for the same dates (Dec 10 to Dec 24). But wait, the return date is Dec 24, so the return flight would be from Perth to Boston on Dec 24. But the user's original plan is to go to Barcelona, then Perth, then return. So if they skip Barcelona, the trip would be Boston to Perth on Dec 10, then return on Dec 24. But the user's original plan is to leave Boston on Dec 10, so if they skip Barcelona, they'd go directly to Perth on Dec 10, then return on Dec 24. But the user's initial request is to check the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire journey, but with the condition on the Barcelona to Perth leg.

So the steps are:

1. Find the cheapest premium economy flights from Boston to Barcelona on Dec 10 (depart) and Barcelona to Perth on Dec 14 (depart), then Perth to Boston on Dec 24 (return). But the user is concerned about the Barcelona to Perth leg's cost. So first, check the price of that leg.

But how to get that? The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can be used for multi-leg flights. However, the user's initial request is for the entire journey, which is three legs: Boston to Barcelona, Barcelona to Perth, Perth to Boston. But the user's condition is about the Barcelona to Perth leg. So maybe the user is considering the total cost of the entire trip, but if the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, they'll skip Barcelona and take a direct flight from Boston to Perth, then return.

But the user's main query is to find the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire trip, but with the condition on the Barcelona to Perth leg. So the first step is to check the cost of the Barcelona to Perth flight. However, the user might not have specified the exact dates for that leg. Let me check the dates again.

The user leaves Boston on Dec 10, stays in Barcelona for four days, so departs Barcelona on Dec 14. Then goes to Perth, and returns to Boston on Dec 24. So the Barcelona to Perth flight departs on Dec 14, and the return flight from Perth to Boston is on Dec 24. So the legs are:

1. Boston to Barcelona (Dec 10)
2. Barcelona to Perth (Dec 14)
3. Perth to Boston (Dec 24)

But the user is concerned about the cost of the second leg (Barcelona to Perth). So the first thing is to get the minimum price for that leg. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can handle multi-leg flights, but the user's query is about the entire journey. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the entire trip as a multi-stop flight, but the condition is on the Barcelona to Perth leg.

Alternatively, the user might be looking for the cheapest way to do the entire trip, but if the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, they'll take a direct flight from Boston to Perth instead. So the steps are:

1. Check the cost of the entire trip (Boston to Barcelona to Perth to Boston) in premium economy. If the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, then check the direct Boston to Perth round-trip flights.

But how to get the cost of the entire trip? The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can be used for multi-leg flights. The legs would be:

- Leg 1: Boston to Barcelona (Dec 10)
- Leg 2: Barcelona to Perth (Dec 14)
- Leg 3: Perth to Boston (Dec 24)

But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API requires an array of legs. However, the user's query is about the entire journey, but the condition is on the Barcelona to Perth leg. So perhaps the user is considering the entire trip's cost, but if the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, they'll skip Barcelona and take a direct flight from Boston to Perth, then return on Dec 24.

But the user's initial request is to find the cheapest premium economy flights for the entire trip, but with the condition on the Barcelona to Perth leg. So the first step is to check the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg. However, the user might not have specified the exact dates for that leg. Wait, the user's departure from Barcelona is on Dec 14, and return from Perth is on Dec 24. So the Barcelona to Perth flight departs on Dec 14, and the return flight from Perth to Boston is on Dec 24.

So to check the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg, we need to get the minimum price for that specific flight. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can be used for multi-leg flights, but the user's condition is about the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the entire trip's cost, but the condition is on the Barcelona to Perth leg. So the first step is to check the cost of the entire trip, but if the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, then check the direct Boston to Perth round-trip.

But how to get the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg? The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can be used for multi-leg flights, but the user's query is about the entire journey. Alternatively, the user might need to check the cost of the Barcelona to Perth flight separately. However, the available APIs don't have a direct way to get the price of a single leg. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can be used for multi-leg flights, but the user's condition is about the cost of the Barcelona to Perth leg. So perhaps the user is considering the entire trip's cost, but the condition is on the Barcelona to Perth leg. Therefore, the first step is to check the cost of the entire trip (Boston to Barcelona to Perth to Boston) in premium economy. If the Barcelona to Perth leg is over 1800, then check the direct Boston to Perth round-trip.

But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the user's message:

"We're planning to leave Boston on December 10th, 2024, and travel to Barcelona. After staying in Barcelona for four days, we'll go to Perth, then return to Boston on December 24th, 2024. I'm looking for the cheapest premium economy flights for this time period. If the ticket price is over 1800 dollars, we won't stay in Barcelona. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Boston to Perth during this time."

So the user is considering the entire trip (Boston to Barcelona to Perth to Boston) and wants the cheapest premium economy flights. However, if
