Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to plan a trip starting from Tokyo on December 16th, 2024, going to Osaka and Nagoya, then returning to Tokyo on December 30th. They'll stay in each city for a week. They need economy class flights, detailed info, and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey is Tokyo → Osaka → Nagoya → Tokyo. Wait, but the return is Tokyo to Tokyo? Wait, the user says they leave Tokyo on Dec 16th, go to Osaka and Nagoya, then return to Tokyo on Dec 30th. So the outbound is Tokyo to Osaka, then Osaka to Nagoya? Or maybe Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya as stops? Wait, the user mentions traveling to Osaka and Nagoya, so maybe it's a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya? Or separate legs? Let me parse the original query again.

The user says: leave from Tokyo on Dec 16th, travel to Osaka and Nagoya. So maybe the first leg is Tokyo to Osaka, then Osaka to Nagoya? Then the return is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th? Wait, but the return date is Dec 30th. Let me check the dates again. They leave on Dec 16th, stay in each city for a week. So the outbound trip would be Dec 16th departure, arriving in Osaka, then staying there for a week (until Dec 23rd?), then going to Nagoya, staying there until Dec 30th? Or maybe the outbound is Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya as a multi-stop? Or maybe two separate legs: Tokyo to Osaka, then Osaka to Nagoya, then Nagoya to Tokyo on the return. But the return date is Dec 30th. So the outbound trip would have two legs: Tokyo to Osaka (Dec 16th), then Osaka to Nagoya (maybe Dec 17th?), and then the return trip is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. Wait, but the user says they'll return to Tokyo on Dec 30th. So the return trip is from Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. So the outbound is Tokyo → Osaka → Nagoya, and the return is Nagoya → Tokyo. But the user mentioned staying in each city for a week. So the outbound trip would have two legs: Tokyo to Osaka (Dec 16th), then Osaka to Nagoya (maybe Dec 17th?), and then the return trip is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. But the user might need to have a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a round trip with stops. Let me think.

Alternatively, the user might have a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya as part of the outbound journey. So the first leg is Tokyo to Osaka on Dec 16th, then Osaka to Nagoya on the same day or next day. Then the return trip is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. But the user's return date is Dec 30th, so the return flight would be from Nagoya to Tokyo on that date. 

So for the outbound, the legs would be:

1. Tokyo to Osaka on Dec 16th
2. Osaka to Nagoya on Dec 17th (assuming they stay in Osaka for a week, but the user says they stay in each city for a week. Wait, the user says they leave Tokyo on Dec 16th, travel to Osaka and Nagoya, then return to Tokyo on Dec 30th. So maybe the outbound trip is Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya as two stops, and the return is Nagoya to Tokyo. But the user might need to have a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya. Alternatively, maybe the user is going to Osaka and Nagoya as separate destinations, but the return is from Nagoya to Tokyo. 

But the user's exact wording is: "leave from Tokyo on December 16th, 2024, and travel to Osaka and Nagoya. We'll return to Tokyo on December 30th, 2024. We'll stay in each of those cities for a week." So the outbound journey is Tokyo → Osaka → Nagoya, and the return is Nagoya → Tokyo. But the dates need to be adjusted. Let's calculate the dates. 

If they leave Tokyo on Dec 16th, and stay in each city for a week, then:

- In Osaka: Dec 16th to Dec 23rd (7 days)
- In Nagoya: Dec 23rd to Dec 30th (7 days)
- Return flight on Dec 30th from Nagoya to Tokyo.

But the return flight would need to be on Dec 30th. So the outbound legs would be:

1. Tokyo to Osaka on Dec 16th
2. Osaka to Nagoya on Dec 23rd (assuming they stay in Osaka until Dec 23rd, then fly to Nagoya)
Wait, but that would mean the second leg is on Dec 23rd. Then the return flight is from Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya in one trip, with the return being from Nagoya to Tokyo. But the exact dates need to be considered. 

Alternatively, the user might have two separate legs for the outbound: Tokyo to Osaka (Dec 16th), then Osaka to Nagoya (Dec 17th), and then the return is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. 

But the user's main request is to find the best economy class flights for this journey. So the first step is to find the multi-stop flights from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya, then return from Nagoya to Tokyo. 

So the legs for the outbound would be:

- Leg 1: Tokyo to Osaka on Dec 16th
- Leg 2: Osaka to Nagoya on Dec 17th (assuming they stay in Osaka for a week, but the user says they stay in each city for a week. Wait, if they leave Tokyo on Dec 16th, and stay in Osaka for a week, they would leave Osaka on Dec 23rd. Then fly to Nagoya on Dec 23rd, stay there until Dec 30th. Then return on Dec 30th. So the outbound legs would be:

1. Tokyo to Osaka on Dec 16th
2. Osaka to Nagoya on Dec 23rd
Then the return leg is Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th.

But the user might need to have a multi-stop flight from Tokyo to Osaka and Nagoya, but that's not possible unless they have a direct flight with stops. Alternatively, the user might have two separate flights: Tokyo to Osaka, then Osaka to Nagoya, then Nagoya to Tokyo. 

But the user's main request is to find the best economy class flights for the entire journey. So the first step is to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool for the outbound journey (Tokyo to Osaka to Nagoya) and the return journey (Nagoya to Tokyo). 

But the user might need to split the outbound into two legs: Tokyo to Osaka (Dec 16th), then Osaka to Nagoya (Dec 23rd), and the return is Nagoya to Tokyo (Dec 30th). 

So for the outbound, the legs would be:

- Leg 1: fromId: Tokyo's airport ID, toId: Osaka's airport ID, date: 2024-12-16
- Leg 2: fromId: Osaka's airport ID, toId: Nagoya's airport ID, date: 2024-12-23

Then the return leg is:

- Leg 1: fromId: Nagoya's airport ID, toId: Tokyo's airport ID, date: 2024-12-30

But the user might need to check the flight details for each leg. However, the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool requires the legs array. So for the outbound, the legs array would have two legs: Tokyo to Osaka and Osaka to Nagoya. Then the return would be a separate multi-stop flight? Or maybe the return is a single leg. 

Wait, the user's return is from Nagoya to Tokyo on Dec 30th. So the return is a single leg. 

So the first step is to find the multi-stop flights for the outbound journey (Tokyo to Osaka to Nagoya) and then the return flight (Nagoya to Tokyo). 

But the user might need to first find the airport IDs for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. So the first step is to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to get the airport IDs for each city. 

So the steps would be:

1. Search for Tokyo's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Tokyo".
2. Search for Osaka's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Osaka".
3. Search for Nagoya's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Nagoya".

Once we have the airport IDs, we can proceed to search for the multi-stop flights. 

Then, for the outbound journey, the legs would be:

- Leg 1: fromId: Tokyo's ID, toId: Osaka's ID, date: 2024-12-16
- Leg
