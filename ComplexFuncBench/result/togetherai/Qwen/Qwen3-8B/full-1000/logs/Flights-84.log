Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user wants to fly from Chengdu to Chicago around December 5, 2024, in economy class and check the cheapest price. If it's over $400, they want to know if transferring via Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is cheaper, but no overnight flights.

First, I need to find the airport codes for Chengdu and Chicago. The user mentioned Chengdu, so I'll use the Search_Flight_Location tool to get the airport ID. The query parameter should be "Chengdu". Then, for Chicago, since there are multiple airports, maybe O'Hare (ORD) or Midway (MDW), but the user might not specify. However, the tool can handle that by returning possible locations. Wait, the user might not have specified the exact Chicago airport, so maybe I should first get the airport IDs for both cities.

Wait, the user's main query is about Chengdu to Chicago. So first, I need to get the airport ID for Chengdu. Let me call Search_Flight_Location with query "Chengdu". The response should give the id for Chengdu's airport, like "CTU.AIRPORT" or similar. Then, for Chicago, I need to get the airport ID. But the user might not specify which one, so maybe the tool can return multiple options. However, the user might be referring to a specific one, but since they didn't mention, perhaps I should proceed with the first result or check both. But the problem is that the Get_Min_Price requires fromId and toId. So I need to get both airport IDs first.
