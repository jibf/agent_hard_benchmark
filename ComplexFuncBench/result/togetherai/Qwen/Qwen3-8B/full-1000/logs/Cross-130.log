I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in New York and Washington for two days each. Please provide hotels within 10 kilometers of the related airports in New York and Washington based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's break down the user's request. They want the fastest plane tickets from Toronto to New York on November 8, 2024, and then from New York to Washington on November 10, 2024. They also need hotels within 10 km of the airports in both cities based on the arrival airports.

First, I need to get the flight details. For the first leg, Toronto to New York. The user mentioned "fastest," so I should use the Search_Flights endpoint with sort set to FASTEST. The parameters required are fromId, toId, departDate, and possibly adults. Since the user didn't specify the number of adults, I'll default to 1. But wait, the user might be traveling alone or with others. Since it's not specified, I'll assume 1 adult. However, the user might need to adjust later, but the initial search should proceed with the given info.

Wait, the fromId and toId are airport IDs. The user provided city names, so I need to find the airport IDs for Toronto and New York. The Search_Flight_Location endpoint can be used for that. So first, call Search_Flight_Location with query "Toronto" to get the fromId, and "New York" for toId. But the user might have specific airports, but since they didn't mention, I'll use the main ones. Let's assume the main airports: Toronto Pearson (YYZ) and New York JFK (JFK) or LGA. But the endpoint will return the correct IDs based on the query.

Once I have the fromId and toId for the first flight, I can call Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST, departDate=2024-11-08. Then, for the return flight from New York to Washington on 2024-11-10, repeat the process: get the toId for Washington (e.g., Dulles (IAD) or Reagan (DCA)), then call Search_Flights again with the appropriate parameters.

After getting the flight details, the user needs hotel bookings near the arrival airports. For each city (New York and Washington), after determining the arrival airport from the flight, use the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates endpoint. But first, I need the latitude and longitude of the airports. For that, use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names. Wait, but the Location_to_Lat_Long tool might not directly give airport coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Flight_Location endpoint returns coordinates? Let me check the tools again.

Looking at the tools, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint returns location IDs, but not coordinates. So to get the coordinates of the airports, I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names. For example, for New York's arrival airport (say, JFK), query "JFK Airport" to get its coordinates. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius=10 km. Similarly for Washington's airport.

But the user mentioned "based on the arrival airports of the flights." So after getting the flight details, the arrival airport for the first flight (New York) and the arrival airport for the second flight (Washington) need to be determined. However, the initial flight search might not specify the arrival airport; it might return multiple options. So perhaps the user needs to select the arrival airport, but since they didn't specify, I'll assume the main ones. Alternatively, the Search_Flights endpoint might return the arrival airport's ID, but the parameters for Search_Flights don't include that. Wait, the Search_Flights endpoint's parameters are fromId, toId, departDate, etc. The toId is the arrival airport's ID. So once the flight is searched, the toId would be the arrival airport's ID. Then, using that toId, I can get the airport's name and then its coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long.

Wait, but the toId is the airport's ID. So maybe the Search_Flight_Location can be used again with the toId to get the airport's name? Or perhaps the toId is sufficient to get the coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long can take the airport's name as a query. For example, if the toId is JFK, then querying "JFK Airport" would get its coordinates.

So the steps would be:

1. For the first flight (Toronto to New York on 2024-11-08):
   a. Use Search_Flight_Location to get fromId (Toronto) and toId (New York).
   b. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, sort=FASTEST.
   c. Get the flight details, which include the arrival airport (toId).
   d. Use Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name (e.g., "JFK Airport") to get coordinates.
   e. Use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-11-08, departure_date=2024-11-10, radius=10, latitude and longitude from step d.

But wait, the user wants to stay in New York for two days, so arrival is on 8th, departure on 10th. Similarly for Washington. So the arrival date for the first hotel is 2024-11-08, departure 2024-11-10. For the second flight, arrival on 2024-11-10, departure on 2024-11-12 (assuming two days in Washington). But the user hasn't specified the departure date from Washington. Wait, the user said they're staying in each city for two days. So for New York, arrival on 8th, stay until 10th. Then flight to Washington on 10th, stay until 12th. So the second hotel in Washington would have arrival_date=2024-11-10, departure_date=2024-11-12.

But the user hasn't specified the exact dates for the second flight. Wait, the user said: "from New York to Washington on November 10, 2024." So the flight departs New York on 10th, arrives in Washington. Then they stay for two days, so departure from Washington would be 12th. So the hotel in Washington would have arrival_date=2024-11-10, departure_date=2024-11-12.

But the user hasn't mentioned the return flight, so maybe they just need the two flights and the hotels for each city. So the first hotel is for New York, arrival on 8th, departure on 10th. The second hotel is for Washington, arrival on 10th, departure on 12th.

But the user's initial request is to check the fastest tickets for the two legs and then hotels near the arrival airports. So the process is:

1. Find the fastest flight from Toronto to New York on 2024-11-08.
2. Find the fastest flight from New York to Washington on 2024-11-10.
3. For each arrival airport (New York and Washington), find hotels within 10 km of the airport's coordinates.

But to get the arrival airports, we need to first get the flight details. However, the initial flight search might return multiple options, so the user might need to select the arrival airport. But since the user hasn't specified, we'll assume the main airports.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto and New York to get their IDs. Then call Search_Flights for the first leg. Then, using the toId from the first flight, get the airport's name and coordinates. Then use that to find hotels. Similarly for the second flight.

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so the process involves multiple steps. However, the user wants the assistant to call the necessary tools. So the first step is to get the flight details, which requires the airport IDs. Therefore, the assistant needs to first call Search_Flight_Location for Toronto and New York to get the fromId and toId. Then proceed with the flight search. Then, for each arrival airport, get the coordinates and then the hotels.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to break it down into multiple tool calls. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per turn. Wait, the user's instruction says "You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query." So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in the same response.

But the initial response should start with the first tool call. Let me outline the steps again:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location for "Toronto" to get fromId.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" to get toId.
3. Call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-11-08, sort=FASTEST.
4. From the flight details, get the arrival airport's ID (toId) for the first flight.
5. Call Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport name (e.g., "JFK Airport") to get coordinates.
6. Call Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-11-08, departure_date=2024-11-10, radius=10, latitude and longitude from step 5.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for the second flight (New York
