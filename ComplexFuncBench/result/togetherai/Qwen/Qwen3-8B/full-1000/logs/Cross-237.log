Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want the cheapest flight from New York to Miami on December 5, 2024, without overnight layovers. So, I need to use the Search_Flights tool. The parameters required are fromId, toId, departDate, and sort. Since they want the cheapest, sort should be CHEAPEST. But wait, the user mentioned no overnight layovers. The tool's parameters don't have a direct option for layover duration, so maybe the API handles that by default, or perhaps I need to ensure the flight is direct. But since the tool's description doesn't mention it, I'll proceed with the given parameters. 

Next, I need to get the fromId and toId. The user mentioned New York and Miami airports. So I should use Search_Flight_Location to find the airport IDs. For New York, querying "New York" might return JFK, LGA, EWR. Similarly for Miami, it's likely MIA, MIA, or FLL. But the user might not specify the exact airport, so I'll have to use the searchDestination endpoint to get the IDs. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool is for finding airports, so I'll call that for both cities.

Once I have the fromId and toId, I can proceed with Search_Flights. The departDate is December 5, 2024, which is 2024-12-05. The sort parameter is CHEAPEST. Also, the user doesn't accept overnight layovers, but since the tool doesn't have a parameter for that, maybe the API's default is to return direct flights, or perhaps I need to handle that in another way. For now, proceed with the given info.

Next, booking a hotel near South Beach in Miami for ten days. The user needs a hotel near South Beach. The Search_Hotels tool requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, and search_type. The search_type can be retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first, I need to find the destination ID for Miami, specifically South Beach. Using Search_Hotel_Destination with query "South Beach, Miami" to get the search_type and maybe the dest_id. Wait, the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint returns the latitude and longitude, but the dest_id is from the searchDestination endpoint. Hmm, maybe the user needs to first find the destination ID for Miami using Search_Hotel_Destination, then use that dest_id in Search_Hotels. But the user specified "near South Beach," so perhaps the search query should be "South Beach, Miami" to get the correct location. Once the dest_id is obtained, then use Search_Hotels with arrival_date as 2024-12-05 (assuming the flight arrives on the 5th, but the stay is ten days, so arrival date might be the 5th and departure on the 15th). Wait, the user says "ten-day stay," so arrival on the 5th and departure on the 15th. So arrival_date is 2024-12-05, departure_date is 2024-12-15. The search_type would be the result from Search_Hotel_Destination, which might be a specific location ID.

Then, the taxi from the airport to the hotel one hour after the flight lands. The flight's arrival time is needed. But since the flight details aren't known yet, maybe the taxi can be booked after the flight is confirmed. However, the user wants the taxi booked in advance. So, after getting the flight's arrival time, we can use Taxi_Search_Location to get the Google Place ID for the airport and the hotel. Then use Search_Taxi with the pick_up_place_id (airport) and drop_off_place_id (hotel), with pick_up_time as one hour after the flight's arrival time. But since the flight's arrival time isn't known yet, this might require a follow-up. However, the user might expect the taxi to be booked once the flight details are known. So, the steps are: first, get the flight details, then get the hotel, then get the taxi.

But the user wants all bookings done. So, the initial steps are to find the flight, then the hotel, then the taxi. However, the taxi requires the hotel's location, which depends on the hotel booking. So, the order is flight first, then hotel, then taxi. But the user might not have the flight details yet. So, the assistant needs to first get the flight details, then proceed with the hotel and taxi.

So, the first tool call should be Search_Flight_Location for New York and Miami to get the fromId and toId. Then use Search_Flights with those IDs, sort by CHEAPEST, and departDate 2024-12-05. Then, once the flight is booked, get the arrival time, but since the flight details might not include arrival time, maybe the taxi can be booked with the flight's arrival time as a parameter. However, the user says "one hour after the flight lands," so the pick_up_time would be arrival_time + 1 hour. But without knowing the arrival time, this is tricky. Alternatively, the taxi can be booked with the flight's arrival date and time, but since the flight details aren't known yet, the assistant might need to proceed step by step.

So, the first step is to find the flight. Then, once the flight is confirmed, get the arrival time, then find the hotel, then the taxi. But the user might expect all steps to be handled in one go. However, the tools available require sequential steps. Therefore, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for New York and Miami to get the fromId and toId. Then call Search_Flights with those IDs, sort by CHEAPEST, and departDate 2024-12-05. Then, once the flight is found, proceed to book the hotel near South Beach, then the taxi.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to break it down into multiple tool calls. However, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So, the first step is to get the flight details. Therefore, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for New York to get the fromId, then for Miami to get the toId. Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location tool's parameters are a query string. So, the assistant needs to call Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the fromId, and then with query "Miami" to get the toId. Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights. But the user might not specify the exact airport, so the assistant has to choose the correct one. However, the tool's description says that the query can be a city name, and the endpoint returns the airport's location ID. So, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for "New York" and "Miami" to get the fromId and toId.

So, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the fromId. Then, another call for "Miami" to get the toId. Then, use those in Search_Flights. But the user's message requires the assistant to make these calls in sequence. However, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. Therefore, the first step is to get the fromId and toId. But the user's initial query is to book the flight, so the assistant needs to start with that.

Wait, the user's message is a single query, so the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for New York and Miami to get the fromId and toId. Then, use those in Search_Flights. Then, proceed to book the hotel and taxi. But the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. So, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for New York. Then, the next is for Miami. Then, Search_Flights. Then, Search_Hotel_Destination for South Beach, Miami to get the search_type and maybe the dest_id. Then, Search_Hotels with that dest_id. Then, Taxi_Search_Location for the airport and hotel to get the place IDs. Then, Search_Taxi.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle all these steps. However, the assistant can only make one tool call at a time. Therefore, the first step is to get the fromId and toId for the flight. So, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the fromId. Then, another call for "Miami" to get the toId. Then, use those in Search_Flights. Then, proceed with the hotel and taxi.

But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so the assistant needs to find the correct ones. However, the tool's description says that the query can be a city name, and the endpoint returns the airport's location ID. So, the assistant should proceed with that.

So, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "New York" to get the fromId. Then, another call for "Miami" to get the toId. Then, use those in Search_Flights. Then, for the hotel, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "South Beach, Miami" to get the search_type and maybe the dest_id. Then, use that in Search_Hotels. For the taxi, after getting the flight's arrival time, call Taxi_Search_Location for the airport and hotel to get the place IDs, then use Search_Taxi.
