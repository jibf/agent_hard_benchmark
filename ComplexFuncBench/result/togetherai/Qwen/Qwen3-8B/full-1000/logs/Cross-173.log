2025-08-15 00:18:15,012 - evaluation_logger_Cross-173 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Nantasket Beach Hotel and detailed descriptions. First, I called Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id. The response gave a landmark: Boston Harbor Islands National Park. Then, I used Search_Attraction_Location to find more info on that park, which led to a cruise product. Next, I fetched the details of that cruise using Get_Attraction_Details. Now, I need to present this information clearly.

The user wants recommendations and descriptions. The main attraction here is the Boston Harbor Sightseeing Cruise. I should highlight the key points from the detailed response: the description of the cruise, what's included, any important policies like free cancellation, and the notable sights. Also, mention the operating company and maybe the reviews if available. Need to make sure it's easy to read, maybe bullet points for clarity. Check if there's any other info needed, but since the user asked for recommendations and details, this seems comprehensive. Make sure to mention the distance from the hotel if available, but the initial response had a distance of 12.2 km. Should I include that? Maybe in the recommendation. Also, note the cancellation policy and any requirements like bringing a ticket. Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and helpful.
