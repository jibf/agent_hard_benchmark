Okay, let's see. The user is asking for detailed information about all available hotel rooms within 30 kilometers of their current location (latitude 37.5742, longitude 114.0774) for tonight. Today is December 15th, 2024, so tonight would be the 15th, but since they're checking in the morning, maybe the arrival date is the 15th and departure is the 16th.

First, I called the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool with the given coordinates, radius 30 km, arrival and departure dates set to 2024-12-15 and 2024-12-16 respectively. The response came back with two hotels. Now, I need to check if the user wants more details on these hotels. 

Looking at the data, each hotel has a hotel_id. The user might need the room availability details for each. So, for each hotel in the result, I should call Get_Room_List_With_Availability using their hotel_id, along with the arrival and departure dates. 

Wait, the user specifically asked for detailed information about the available rooms. The current tool response gives some info like prices, check-in/check-out times, but maybe the room details like room types, amenities, etc., are not fully provided. The Get_Room_List_With_Availability tool can provide more detailed room information. 

So, I should iterate over each hotel in the result and call that tool. Let me check the parameters required for Get_Room_List_With_Availability: hotel_id, departure_date, arrival_date, adults, room_qty, and children_age. The user hasn't specified the number of adults or children, so I'll use the defaults (adults=1, room_qty=1). 

First hotel has hotel_id 5895694. Let me call the Get_Room_List_With_Availability for that. Then the second hotel with hotel_id 1573952. 

Wait, but the user might not need that if they just want the info from the current response. The current response includes some room details like the unit configuration label, price breakdown, etc. But maybe the user wants more specifics. However, the assistant's role is to provide the information based on the tools available. Since the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates already gave some detailed info, perhaps the answer can be compiled from that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to know the room options available, like different room types, amenities, etc., which might require the Get_Room_List_With_Availability. But the current response includes the unit_configuration_label, which mentions "1 bed" for both. 

The user's query is to check the detailed information about all available hotel rooms. The current tool response provides some details, but maybe the assistant should present that info clearly. 

So, the answer should list the two hotels found, their names, locations, prices, check-in/check-out times, and other relevant details from the tool response. The assistant should format this information in a user-friendly way, highlighting key points like hotel names, prices, availability, and any other important details. 

I need to make sure the dates are correct. The arrival is on the 15th, departure on the 16th. The hotels have availability as soldout is 0, so they are available. The prices are in CNY, and the tool response includes the min_total_price. 

So, the final answer should present both hotels with their details, maybe bullet points, and mention that they are available for the specified dates. Also, note any additional info like review scores, check-in times, etc.
