2025-08-15 01:02:34,872 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-27 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked for detailed information about the Taj Mahal after finding it on social media. I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Taj Mahal" as the query. The response gave me a product slug, which I then used in the Get_Attraction_Details tool. The data from that tool has a lot of information.

Now, I need to present this information in a user-friendly way. The user might be interested in knowing what the tour includes, cancellation policies, accessibility, and maybe the itinerary. The description mentions a day trip to the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, so highlighting that could be useful. Also, the additional info about wheelchair access and age requirements is important. I should mention the included and excluded items, like the private guide and lunch. The cancellation policy is free, which is a good point to emphasize. I should also note the operated by RAFAEL TOURS and the representative price. Need to make sure the response is clear and covers all the key details without overwhelming the user. Let me structure this step by step.
