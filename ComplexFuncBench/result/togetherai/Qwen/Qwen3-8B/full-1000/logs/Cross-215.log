I'm expecting to stay in each city for seven days. My address is 1200 Market St in Philadelphia. Can you book a taxi to take me to the airport three hours before the flight takes off and bring me home one hour after the returning flight lands?

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want the cheapest connecting flight from Philadelphia to Baltimore and then to Richmond, with a return trip. They also need taxi arrangements for airport transfers.

Starting with the flights: The user mentioned a multi-stop flight. So I should use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool. The legs would be Philadelphia to Baltimore on November 10, then Baltimore to Richmond on the same day? Wait, the return trip is from Richmond back to Philadelphia. Wait, the user said "leaving from Philadelphia on November 10, 2024, going to Baltimore and Richmond, then returning to Philadelphia." So the outbound is Philadelphia to Baltimore to Richmond, and the return is Richmond to Philadelphia. But the dates for the return aren't specified. The user mentioned staying in each city for seven days, so maybe the return flight is on November 17? But the user didn't specify the return date. Hmm, maybe I need to assume the return date is 7 days after the departure date. But the user might have intended the return flight to be on the same day? Wait, the initial departure is November 10, and they stay in each city for seven days. So the outbound trip is Nov 10, and the return would be Nov 17. But the user didn't specify the return date, so maybe I need to ask for clarification. However, since the user is asking for the cheapest connecting flight, perhaps the return flight is on the same day? Wait, the user might have a typo. Let me check again.

The user says: "leaving from Philadelphia on November 10, 2024, going to Baltimore and Richmond, then returning to Philadelphia." So the outbound is Philadelphia to Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10, and the return is from Richmond to Philadelphia. But the return date isn't given. The user also mentions staying in each city for seven days, so maybe the return flight is on Nov 17. But without explicit dates, this is an assumption. However, the user might have intended the return flight to be on the same day. Alternatively, maybe the return is on Nov 17. Since the user hasn't provided the return date, perhaps I should proceed with the outbound and ask for the return date. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the return is on the same day, but that's not possible for a multi-stop. Wait, the user might have meant that the outbound is Philadelphia to Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10, and the return is Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. But the user hasn't specified the return date. This is a problem. However, the user might have intended the return flight to be on the same day, but that's not feasible. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed with the information given. Alternatively, maybe the return is on the same day, but that's not possible. So I need to clarify, but since I can't ask, I'll proceed with the outbound and assume the return date is 7 days later. But the user might have intended the return to be on the same day. Alternatively, maybe the user wants a round-trip with stops. Wait, the user says "returning to Philadelphia" after visiting Baltimore and Richmond. So the outbound is Philadelphia to Baltimore to Richmond, and the return is Richmond to Philadelphia. The dates for the return are not given, but the user mentioned staying in each city for seven days. So the outbound is Nov 10, and the return would be Nov 17. So the legs for the outbound would be Philadelphia to Baltimore on Nov 10, then Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10. The return leg would be Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. But the user hasn't specified the return date, so this is an assumption. However, the user might have intended the return to be on the same day, but that's not possible. So I'll proceed with the outbound and return dates as Nov 10 and Nov 17, respectively. 

Next, the user wants the cheapest option, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST". The cabin class is not specified, so default to ECONOMY. The number of adults is 1, as default. The children parameter is not mentioned, so maybe omit it. 

Then, the user needs a taxi to the airport three hours before the flight and back home one hour after the return flight. For that, I need to find the airport in Philadelphia. The user's address is 1200 Market St, Philadelphia. So first, use the Search_Flight_Location tool to find the airport in Philadelphia. The query would be "Philadelphia" or "1200 Market St, Philadelphia". Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool's query parameter is for names of airports, locations, cities, etc. So using "Philadelphia" should return the airport. Then, get the airport's id. Then, use Taxi_Search_Location to find the pickup and drop-off locations. The user's address is 1200 Market St, so that's the pickup location. The airport's location is the drop-off. Then, use Search_Taxi with the place IDs and the pick-up time. 

Wait, the user wants the taxi to take them to the airport three hours before the flight. So the pick-up time would be flight departure time minus 3 hours. Similarly, the return taxi would be one hour after the return flight lands. So the drop-off time would be return flight arrival time plus 1 hour. But the user hasn't provided the flight times yet. So the taxi booking depends on the flight times, which are not known yet. Therefore, the taxi booking can't be done until the flight details are known. So the steps are: first, find the flight details, then use those to determine the taxi times. 

So the first step is to search for the multi-stop flight. Then, once the flight details (departure and arrival times) are known, proceed to book the taxi. 

But the user is asking for the entire process, so the assistant needs to first get the flight information, then the taxi. So the first tool call is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as Philadelphia to Baltimore on Nov 10, then Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10, and return from Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. Wait, but the user didn't specify the return date. So maybe the return is on the same day? That's not possible. Alternatively, the user might have intended the return to be on the same day, but that's not feasible. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed with the information given. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a round-trip with stops, so the outbound is Philadelphia to Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10, and the return is Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. So the legs for the outbound are two legs: Philadelphia to Baltimore on Nov 10, and Baltimore to Richmond on Nov 10. The return leg is Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. 

So the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be:

legs: [
  {fromId: 'PHL.AIRPORT', toId: 'BWI.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-10'},
  {fromId: 'BWI.AIRPORT', toId: 'RDU.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-10'},
  {fromId: 'RDU.AIRPORT', toId: 'PHL.AIRPORT', date: '2024-11-17'}
]

Wait, but the user said "returning to Philadelphia" after visiting Baltimore and Richmond. So the return is from Richmond to Philadelphia. So the return leg is Richmond to Philadelphia on Nov 17. 

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so this is an assumption. However, the user mentioned staying in each city for seven days, so the return date would be 7 days after the departure date. 

So the first tool call is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as above, sort by CHEAPEST, cabin class ECONOMY. 

Once the flight details are obtained, the next step is to find the airport in Philadelphia using Search_Flight_Location with query "Philadelphia" to get the airport's id. Then, use Taxi_Search_Location for the user's address (1200 Market St, Philadelphia) to get the pickup place ID. Then, use Search_Taxi with the pickup and drop-off place IDs, and the pick-up time (flight departure time minus 3 hours) and return time (flight arrival time plus 1 hour). 

But since the flight details are not known yet, the taxi booking can't be done until the flight is booked. So the first step is to get the flight information. 

Therefore, the first tool call is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs as specified, sort by CHEAPEST, and cabin class ECONOMY. 

Wait, but the user's query is to find the cheapest connecting flight, so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST". 

So the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be:

  "legs": [
    {"fromId": "PHL.AIRPORT", "toId": "BWI.AIRPORT", "date": "2024-11-10"},
