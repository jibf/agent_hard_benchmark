Then we'll fly from Paris to London on November 9th, 2024. Finally, we'll go back to Los Angeles on November 19th, 2024. Can you give us the info about economy class?

Okay, let's see. The user is planning a trip with three legs: LA to Paris on Nov 5, Paris to London on Nov 9, and back to LA on Nov 19. They want economy class info.

First, I need to check if there's a tool for multi-stop flights. The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool seems right. The parameters require legs as an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date. Each leg's dates are Nov 5, Nov 9, and Nov 19. 

But wait, the user mentioned three flights: LA to Paris, Paris to London, and London back to LA. So the legs array should have three entries. Each leg's fromId and toId need to be airport IDs. However, the user provided city names, not IDs. So I need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool to get the airport IDs for Los Angeles, Paris, London, and maybe the return trip's destination.

Wait, the return trip is from London to LA. So the legs would be:
1. LA to Paris (Nov 5)
2. Paris to London (Nov 9)
3. London to LA (Nov 19)

But the Search_Flight_Location tool takes a query parameter. So I need to call that tool for each city to get their airport IDs. For example, search for "Los Angeles" to get the fromId for the first leg's fromId. Similarly for Paris, London, and then London again for the return trip.

But the user hasn't provided the airport IDs yet. So the first step is to retrieve the airport IDs for each location using the Search_Flight_Location tool. Then, use those IDs in the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool with the legs array.

Wait, but the user might not know the exact airport codes. So the Search_Flight_Location tool would return the airport's ID based on the query. For example, searching "Los Angeles" might return an ID like "LAX.AIRPORT" or similar. Then, each leg's fromId and toId would be those IDs.

So the plan is:
1. Use Search_Flight_Location for each city (Los Angeles, Paris, London) to get their airport IDs.
2. Then, construct the legs array with the fromId and toId for each leg, along with the dates.
3. Call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array, adults=2 (since it's a partner and the user), cabinClass=ECONOMY.

But the user hasn't specified the number of adults. Wait, the user says "my partner and I", so that's two adults. So adults=2.

Also, the children parameter is optional. The user didn't mention any children, so maybe leave it out or set to 0. But the tool's parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops have children as a string, like "0,1,17" for ages. Since there are no children, maybe omit it or set to an empty string. But the required parameters are legs, so other parameters are optional.

So first, need to get the airport IDs for each location. Let me check the tools again. The Search_Flight_Location tool's parameters require a query string. So for each city, call that tool.

But the user's query is in one message. So the assistant needs to first get the airport IDs for Los Angeles, Paris, and London. Then, use those IDs to build the legs array for the multi-stop flight search.

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each of these cities. Let me structure that.

First, search for "Los Angeles" to get the fromId for the first leg's fromId. Then search for "Paris" to get the toId for the first leg. Then search for "London" for the second leg's toId. Then search for "London" again for the third leg's fromId, and "Los Angeles" again for the third leg's toId.

Wait, the third leg is from London to LA, so the fromId would be the airport ID for London, and toId for LA.

So the steps are:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get the airport ID for LA.
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Paris" to get the airport ID for Paris.
3. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "London" to get the airport ID for London.

Once those IDs are obtained, construct the legs array as:

[
  { fromId: LA_ID, toId: Paris_ID, date: '2024-11-05' },
  { fromId: Paris_ID, toId: London_ID, date: '2024-11-09' },
  { fromId: London_ID, toId: LA_ID, date: '2024-11-19' }
]

Then, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with these legs, adults=2, cabinClass=ECONOMY.

But the user's initial message doesn't have the airport IDs, so the assistant needs to first retrieve them. However, the tools provided don't allow for multiple steps in one response. Wait, the user is asking for the info, so the assistant needs to make the necessary function calls step by step.

But in the current setup, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. So the first step is to get the airport IDs for each location. Let me check the available tools again.

Yes, the Search_Flight_Location tool is available. So the first tool call should be to get the airport ID for Los Angeles. Then, the next step would be to get Paris, then London. But since the user's query is a single message, the assistant needs to handle this step by step.

But in the current context, the user hasn't provided any previous interactions, so the assistant must start by getting the airport IDs. However, the user's question is about the entire trip, so the assistant needs to first retrieve the necessary airport IDs to proceed with the flight search.

Therefore, the first tool call should be to Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get the fromId for the first leg. Then, subsequent calls for Paris and London. But since the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, the first step is to get the LA airport ID.

Wait, but the user's message includes all three legs. So the assistant needs to get the airport IDs for all three cities. However, the assistant can't make three separate calls in one response. So the first step is to get the airport ID for Los Angeles, then Paris, then London. But the user's initial query is a single message, so the assistant must handle this step by step.

But in the current setup, the assistant is supposed to make the necessary function calls. So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each of the cities involved. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Therefore, the first tool call would be to get the airport ID for Los Angeles.

Wait, but the user's message includes three legs, so the assistant needs to get the airport IDs for all three cities. However, the assistant can't do that in one step. So the first step is to get the airport ID for Los Angeles. Then, the next step would be Paris, then London. But since the user's query is a single message, the assistant must handle this in a way that requires multiple steps. However, in the current context, the assistant is supposed to generate the first tool call based on the user's message.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. But according to the instructions, for each function call, return a json object within tool_call tags. So the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response.

Wait, the user's message is a single query, and the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. For example, first call Search_Flight_Location for Los Angeles, then for Paris, then for London. Then, once all IDs are obtained, call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops.

But the assistant's response can include multiple tool calls. So the first step is to get the airport IDs for all three cities. Let me check the tools again. The Search_Flight_Location tool's parameters require a query string. So the assistant can call that tool three times with queries "Los Angeles", "Paris", and "London".

So the first tool call would be to Search_Flight_Location with query "Los Angeles" to get the fromId for the first leg. Then, the next tool call would be for Paris, then London. Once all three IDs are obtained, the assistant can then call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array.

But the user's message is a single query, so the assistant needs to handle this step by step. However, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response. Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each of the three cities.

Wait, but the user's message is about three legs, so the assistant needs to get the airport IDs for Los Angeles, Paris, and London. So the first three tool calls would be to get those IDs. Then, the fourth tool call would be to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array.

But the assistant's response can include multiple tool calls. So the first response would be to call Search_Flight_Location for each of the three cities. However, the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, no, the instructions say "For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within tool_call XML tags." So each tool call is a separate XML tag. Therefore, the assistant can make multiple tool calls in one response
