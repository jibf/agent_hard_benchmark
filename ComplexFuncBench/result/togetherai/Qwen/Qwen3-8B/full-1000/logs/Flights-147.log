Okay, let's tackle the user's request step by step. They want to travel from Boston to Madrid on November 25, 2024, and return on December 2, 2024. They need the cheapest air tickets around those dates, detailed flight info, and a seat map.

First, I need to find the airports for Boston and Madrid. The user mentioned locations, so I should use the Search_Flight_Location tool for both cities. For Boston, the query is "Boston", and for Madrid, it's "Madrid". This will give me the airport IDs (fromId and toId) needed for subsequent steps.

Next, to find the cheapest flights, the Get_Min_Price tool seems appropriate. It searches for the minimum price within 5 days before and after the query date. The parameters required are fromId, toId, departDate, returnDate, and cabinClass. Since the user wants the cheapest, I'll set cabinClass to ECONOMY. The departDate is November 25, 2024, and returnDate is December 2, 2024. Using these, the tool should return the lowest priced flights.

Once I have the flight details, the user also wants detailed information like baggage allowances, ticket price breakdown, and insurance prices. The Get_Flight_Details tool requires a token, which can be obtained from the searchFlights or searchFlightsMultiStops endpoints. However, since the user is asking for the cheapest, maybe first using Get_Min_Price gives the token, or perhaps I need to first search flights with the Search_Flights tool. Wait, the Get_Min_Price endpoint might not provide the token directly. Let me check the tools again.

Looking at the tools, Get_Min_Price doesn't mention providing a token. The Search_Flights tool does return a token. But the user wants the cheapest around the dates, so maybe first use Get_Min_Price to find the minimum price, then use Search_Flights with the same parameters to get the token. Alternatively, maybe the Get_Min_Price is part of the search process. Hmm, the description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days, so perhaps it's a separate step. But the user might need the token from the search to get details. 

Wait, the user's main goal is to find the cheapest tickets. So first, use Get_Min_Price to get the minimum price info. Then, use Search_Flights with the same parameters (fromId, toId, departDate, returnDate, sort by CHEAPEST) to get the token. Then, use Get_Flight_Details with that token to get detailed info. Then, once the flight is selected, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details to get the seat map.

But the user might not have selected a specific flight yet. So the process would be:

1. Find airport IDs for Boston and Madrid using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price to find the cheapest flights around the dates.
3. Use Search_Flights with the same parameters (fromId, toId, departDate, returnDate, sort by CHEAPEST) to get the token.
4. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get detailed flight info.
5. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details to get the seat map.

But the user might not have a specific flight selected yet. So maybe the Get_Min_Price is the first step to find the cheapest options, then proceed to get the details. However, the Get_Min_Price might not provide the token. So perhaps the correct approach is to first search flights with Search_Flights, sort by CHEAPEST, get the token, then get details. But the user wants the cheapest around the dates, so maybe using Get_Min_Price first to confirm the price range, then use Search_Flights to get the actual flight details.

Alternatively, the Get_Min_Price might be part of the search process. Let me check the parameters again. The Get_Min_Price requires fromId, toId, departDate, returnDate, and cabinClass. The Search_Flights also requires fromId, toId, departDate, and optionally returnDate, sort, etc. So perhaps the user should first use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST to get the cheapest flights, then use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info, and then Get_Seat_Map.

But the user's question is to find the cheapest tickets around the dates. So the steps would be:

1. Find airport IDs for Boston and Madrid.
2. Use Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate, returnDate, sort=CHEAPEST to get the cheapest flights.
3. From the search results, get the token.
4. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get detailed info.
5. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details.

But the user might not have a specific flight selected yet. So the initial step is to find the airports, then search for flights, then get details, then seat map.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Boston and Madrid to get their IDs. Then, use Search_Flights with those IDs, the dates, and sort by CHEAPEST. Then, get the token from the search results, use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info, and then Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might not have a specific flight selected yet. So the process is:

1. Search for airports (Boston and Madrid) to get fromId and toId.
2. Search flights with those IDs, dates, sort by CHEAPEST.
3. Get the token from the search results.
4. Use Get_Flight_Details with the token to get detailed info.
5. Then, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details.

But the user's question is to find the cheapest tickets around the dates. So the first step is to find the airports, then search for flights, then get details, then seat map.

So the first tool call should be Search_Flight_Location for Boston and Madrid. Then, use Search_Flights with the IDs, dates, sort by CHEAPEST. Then, Get_Flight_Details, then Get_Seat_Map.

But the user might not have specified a specific flight yet, so the initial steps are to find the airports, then search for flights, then get details, then seat map.

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for Boston and Madrid. Then, use Search_Flights with the IDs, dates, sort by CHEAPEST. Then, Get_Flight_Details, then Get_Seat_Map.
