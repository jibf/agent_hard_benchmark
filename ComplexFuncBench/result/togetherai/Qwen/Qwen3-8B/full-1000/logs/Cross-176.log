Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Hotel Route-Inn Sakaide-Kita Inter in Takamatsu and detailed descriptions. First, I called the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By with the hotel_id 404817. The response mentioned Takamatsu Symbol Tower, which is 11.95 km away. Then, I used Search_Attraction_Location with that tower's name to get more info. The result was a tour product, not the tower itself. So, I tried Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from that search. The details provided a tour description, including activities like making Sanuki Udon and visiting Ritsurin Park. 

Wait, the user wanted attractions near the hotel, but the search led to a tour product. Maybe the Symbol Tower isn't the main attraction. The tour details mention Ritsurin Park, which is a famous spot. I should check if Ritsurin Park is nearby. The tour's description says it's a famous scenery spot, so maybe that's a key attraction. Also, the tour includes Udon making, which is a local experience. 

I need to present the tour as a recommended activity near the hotel, highlighting the included attractions like Ritsurin Park and the Udon experience. Even though the initial search was for the Symbol Tower, the tour seems to be a popular option. I should mention the tour details, the included activities, and note that it's a private guided excursion. Also, include the price and cancellation policy info from the response. Make sure to explain that while the Symbol Tower was the closest landmark, the tour offers a more comprehensive experience. Check if there's any other info needed, but since the user asked for detailed descriptions, this tour's details should suffice.
