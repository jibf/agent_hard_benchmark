Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user wants their friend to fly from Chongqing to Boston with a layover in Singapore around December 15, 2024, and they need the cheapest multi-stop flight with no overnight layovers. Also, they want the seat map for that flight.

First, I need to figure out the steps. The user mentioned a multi-stop flight, so the legs array will have two legs: Chongqing to Singapore and then Singapore to Boston. But the departure date is around December 15, so I should check dates within 5 days before and after that date to find the cheapest options. The Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API can help here. However, the user also wants to ensure there are no overnight layovers. The problem is, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops doesn't mention checking layover durations. So maybe the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops API is better because it allows specifying sort by cheapest and might include layover time checks. Wait, but the user wants the cheapest, so maybe first use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops to find the minimum price, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the actual flight details, ensuring no overnight layovers. But how to check for overnight layovers? The API parameters don't have a direct way, so maybe the user's requirement is to avoid layovers that last more than a day. But since the APIs don't specify that, perhaps the user is just looking for flights with a layover in Singapore, not necessarily the duration. Wait, the user says "doesn't accept flights with overnight layovers," so the layover in Singapore should be during the day. But how to ensure that? The APIs might not have a parameter for that, so maybe the user is assuming that the layover is a short stop. However, since the tools don't have a way to specify layover duration, perhaps the best approach is to first find the cheapest multi-stop flight using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight details, and then check the layover duration. But since the user wants the seat map, we need the offerToken from the flight search. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the fromId for Chongqing and Singapore, and toId for Boston. Wait, the user is departing from Chongqing to Boston with a layover in Singapore. So the legs would be Chongqing to Singapore on a certain date, then Singapore to Boston on another date. But the user wants the departure around December 15, so the first leg's date would be around that date, and the second leg's date would be after the first leg's date. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API looks for flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is December 15, 2024. The legs need to be in an array. So first, I need to get the location IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided the exact dates for the legs, just the departure around December 15. So the first leg's date would be around that date, and the second leg's date would be after. But the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API requires the legs array with dates. So maybe the user is looking for the cheapest multi-stop flight with the first leg departing around December 15, and the second leg departing after. But the exact dates aren't specified. So perhaps the first step is to get the location IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston using the Search_Flight_Location API. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for "Chongqing" to get the fromId for Chongqing. Then call it again for "Singapore" to get the fromId for Singapore (but since the second leg is from Singapore to Boston, the fromId for Singapore would be the same as the toId for the first leg). Wait, the legs array requires fromId and toId. So for the first leg, fromId is Chongqing's ID, toId is Singapore's ID, and date is around December 15. The second leg's fromId is Singapore's ID, toId is Boston's ID, and date is after the first leg's date. But the user hasn't specified the exact dates, just the departure around December 15. So the first leg's date could be December 15, and the second leg's date could be December 16, but the exact dates need to be determined. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API will look for flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is December 15, and the API will check dates from December 10 to December 20. But the user wants the departure around that date, so the first leg's date is within that range. 

But the user also wants the cheapest multi-stop flight. So first, I need to get the location IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston. Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array containing both legs, with dates in the range. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops requires the legs array with dates. But the user hasn't specified the exact dates, so maybe the API will find the cheapest options within the 5-day window. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops API's description says it returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So the query date is December 15, 2024. So the API will look for flights with departure dates from December 10 to December 20. But the user wants the departure around December 15, so the first leg's date would be in that range. However, the user also wants the layover in Singapore to not be overnight. So the first leg's arrival in Singapore and the second leg's departure from Singapore should be on the same day. But how to ensure that? The APIs don't have a parameter for that, so maybe the user is assuming that the layover is a short stop. But since the tools don't have a way to specify that, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the available APIs. 

So first, get the location IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston. Then, use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array containing both legs, with dates in the range. Then, once the minimum price is found, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops to get the flight details, sort by cheapest, and then get the offerToken to retrieve the seat map. 

But the user wants the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight. So the first step is to find the cheapest flight, which requires using Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return the actual flight details, just the minimum price. So perhaps the user needs to first get the minimum price, then use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs and parameters to get the flight details, including the dates. 

But the user also wants the seat map, which requires the offerToken from the flight search. So the steps would be:

1. Search for location IDs for Chongqing, Singapore, and Boston using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Use Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops with the legs array (Chongqing to Singapore, Singapore to Boston) and query date December 15, 2024 to find the minimum price.
3. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the same legs, sort by CHEAPEST, and get the flight details, including the offerToken.
4. Finally, use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken to retrieve the seat map.

But the user's query says "look for the departure dates of the cheapest multi-stop flight", so the departure dates would be the dates of the legs. However, the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops might not return the actual dates, just the price. So the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be needed to get the actual flight details, including the dates. 

But the user might not have provided the exact dates for the legs, so the legs array in the API calls would need to have the dates. However, the user hasn't specified the exact dates, just the departure around December 15. So the legs' dates would be in the range of December 10 to December 20. But the user wants the departure around December 15, so the first leg's date is around that date. 

But the problem is that the legs array requires specific dates. So perhaps the user is looking for the cheapest flight that departs around December 15, with a layover in Singapore. So the first leg's date is around December 15, and the second leg's date is after. 

But without knowing the exact dates, the API calls would need to use the query date of December 15, and the Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops would find the cheapest options within the 5-day window. 

So the first step is to get the location IDs. Let's start with that. 

First, call Search_Flight_Location for "Chongqing" to get the fromId for Chongqing. Then, call it again for "Singapore" to get the fromId for Singapore (but since the second leg is from Singapore to Boston, the fromId for Singapore would be the same as the toId for the first leg). Wait, the toId for the first leg is Singapore's ID, and the fromId for the second leg is Singapore's ID. So the user needs
