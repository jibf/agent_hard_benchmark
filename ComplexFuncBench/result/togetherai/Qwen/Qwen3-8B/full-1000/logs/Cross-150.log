Okay, let's tackle the user's query step by step. The user wants two things: the detailed information of the fastest flight from Beijing to Toronto on September 20, 2024, and hotel availability within 10 km of the airport on that day.

First, I need to find the flight details. The user mentioned "fastest flight," so I should use the Search_Flights endpoint with sort set to FASTEST. But wait, to use that, I need the fromId and toId for Beijing and Toronto airports. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help get those IDs. Let me check if I can get the airport IDs for Beijing and Toronto first.

So, I'll call Search_Flight_Location with query "Beijing" to get the fromId, and similarly for Toronto to get the toId. Once I have those IDs, I can proceed to Search_Flights with departDate as 2024-09-20 and sort by FASTEST. The token from that flight search will then be used in Get_Flight_Details to retrieve the detailed info.

Next, for the hotel availability. The user wants hotels within 10 km of the airport. First, I need the airport's coordinates. Using Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport's name (like Beijing Capital International Airport) should give me the latitude and longitude. Then, I can use Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with those coordinates, arrival_date and departure_date as 2024-09-20, and radius 10 km. Wait, the departure date is the same as the arrival date? That might not make sense. Wait, the user is checking for hotels on the day of arrival, which is September 20. So arrival_date is 2024-09-20 and departure_date would be the next day, but the user didn't specify. Hmm, maybe the user just wants hotels available on that day, so perhaps the departure_date is the same as arrival_date? Or maybe the user is checking for check-in on the 20th and check-out on the 21st. Since the user didn't specify, I might need to assume that the departure_date is the same as arrival_date, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for hotels on the day of arrival, so arrival_date is 2024-09-20 and departure_date could be the same, but that might not be correct. Wait, the parameters for Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates require both arrival and departure dates. Since the user hasn't provided the departure date, maybe they are looking for hotels on the same day, so perhaps the departure_date is the same as arrival_date. But that's a bit unclear. However, the user's main point is the availability on that day, so maybe the departure_date is the same as arrival_date. Alternatively, maybe the user is checking for hotels on the day of arrival, so the arrival_date is 2024-09-20 and departure_date is 2024-09-21. But without more info, I'll proceed with the arrival_date as 2024-09-20 and departure_date as 2024-09-21, assuming a one-night stay. But the user might have intended the same date. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. However, the user's main request is about the day of the flight, so maybe the hotel is for the same day. But hotels typically require check-in and check-out dates. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should use the arrival_date as 2024-09-20 and departure_date as 2024-09-21. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for hotels available on that day, so the departure_date could be the same as arrival_date. But I need to make an assumption here. Let me proceed with arrival_date as 2024-09-20 and departure_date as 2024-09-21, and radius 10 km. Also, the latitude and longitude of the airport can be obtained via Location_to_Lat_Long once I have the airport's name. Wait, the user mentioned "within 10 kilometers of the airport," so I need the airport's coordinates. So first, get the airport's name. For Beijing, the main airport is Beijing Capital International Airport. So I can use Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Beijing Capital International Airport" to get its coordinates. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 10 km. 

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Get fromId for Beijing using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Get toId for Toronto using Search_Flight_Location.
3. Search flights from Beijing to Toronto on 2024-09-20, sorted by FASTEST.
4. Use the token from step 3 to get flight details via Get_Flight_Details.
5. Get the coordinates of Beijing Capital International Airport using Location_to_Lat_Long.
6. Search hotels near those coordinates with arrival_date 2024-09-20, departure_date 2024-09-21, radius 10 km.

Wait, but the user might be referring to the arrival airport in Toronto. So maybe I need to get the coordinates of Toronto's main airport, Pearson International Airport. So step 5 should be for Toronto's airport. But the user's query is about the airport in Toronto, so the hotel should be near Toronto's airport. So after getting the flight details, I need to get the arrival airport's coordinates. Wait, but the user is asking for hotels near the airport on the day of arrival. So the flight is from Beijing to Toronto on 2024-09-20, so the arrival is in Toronto. Therefore, the hotel should be near Toronto's airport. So step 5 should be for Toronto's airport. But how do I get the airport's name? Well, the user might not specify, but the flight's arrival airport is Toronto. However, the flight details might include the arrival airport's name. But since I don't have that yet, maybe I need to first get the toId for Toronto, then get the airport's name from that. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location gives the airport's name. So when I search for Toronto, the response would include the airport's name. Then, I can use that name to get the coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long. Alternatively, maybe the toId is sufficient. But the Location_to_Lat_Long requires a query, which can be the airport's name. So the steps would be:

After getting the toId for Toronto, use that to get the airport's name (maybe from the Search_Flight_Location response), then use that name in Location_to_Lat_Long to get the coordinates. Then use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates.

But the user's query is about the airport in Toronto, so the hotel should be near Toronto's airport. Therefore, the process is:

1. Search for Beijing's airport ID (fromId) and Toronto's airport ID (toId).
2. Search flights from Beijing to Toronto on 2024-09-20, sorted by FASTEST.
3. Get the flight details using the token from step 2.
4. Get the coordinates of Toronto's airport (using its name, obtained from step 1 or from the flight details).
5. Search hotels near Toronto's airport coordinates with arrival_date 2024-09-20 and departure_date 2024-09-21, radius 10 km.

But the user might not have specified which airport in Toronto, so assuming the main one, Pearson International Airport. Alternatively, the flight details might include the arrival airport's name. However, since the user hasn't provided that, I need to proceed with the toId for Toronto, which might correspond to the main airport. But the Search_Flight_Location for Toronto might return multiple airports. So perhaps the user needs to specify, but since they didn't, I'll proceed with the first result or the main one.

So, the initial steps are to call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and Toronto to get their IDs. Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights. Then, get the flight details. Then, get the coordinates of the arrival airport (Toronto) and search for hotels nearby.

But the user's query is about the fastest flight from Beijing to Toronto, so the arrival airport is Toronto. Therefore, the hotel should be near Toronto's airport. So the steps are as outlined.

Now, considering the tools available, the first tool to call is Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and Toronto to get their IDs. Then, use those IDs in Search_Flights. Then, get the flight details. Then, get the coordinates of the arrival airport (Toronto) and search for hotels.

But the user might not have specified the arrival airport, so perhaps the flight details will include the arrival airport's name. However, since the user is asking for the fastest flight from Beijing to Toronto, the arrival airport is likely Toronto Pearson International Airport. So, to get the coordinates, I can use the name "Toronto Pearson International Airport" in Location_to_Lat_Long.

But the user might not have specified the exact airport, so perhaps the flight details will include the arrival airport's name. However, since the flight search is done first, the token from that search can be used to get the flight details, which might include the arrival airport's name. But the Get_Flight_Details tool's parameters require a token, which is obtained from
