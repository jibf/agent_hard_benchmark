Okay, let's break down the user's problem step by step. The user is at Toronto Pearson International Airport on November 12th, 2024, at 2 o'clock. They want to rent a car to visit the most trending attraction in Toronto and return it near the attraction 26 hours later. 

First, I need to figure out which attractions in Toronto are trending. The user mentioned the most trending attraction, so I should use the Search_Attractions tool. But to use that, I need an 'id' parameter, which can be obtained from the Search_Attraction_Location tool. The Search_Attraction_Location requires a query, which in this case is "Toronto". 

So, the first step is to call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Toronto" to get the list of attractions and their IDs. Once I have the IDs, I can then use Search_Attractions with the sortBy parameter set to "trending" to find the most trending one. 

Assuming I get the ID of the most trending attraction, the next step is to determine the location details of that attraction. However, the user wants to return the car near the attraction, so I might need the coordinates of the attraction's location. But the tools provided don't have a direct way to get the coordinates of an attraction. Wait, the Search_Attraction_Location might return the necessary information like coordinates. 

Alternatively, once I have the attraction's ID, maybe the Search_Attractions tool would return the location details. But looking at the parameters, the Search_Attractions tool requires an 'id' and sorts by a parameter. The response from Search_Attraction_Location might include the 'id' and other details like coordinates. 

Wait, the Search_Attraction_Location's description says it returns specific info like slug, productId, id, etc. So, after getting the list of attractions in Toronto, I can pick the one with the highest trending score. Then, using that ID, I can get more details if needed. 

Once the trending attraction is identified, the user needs to rent a car. For that, the Search_Car_Rentals tool is needed. But to use that, I need pick-up and drop-off coordinates. The user is at the airport, so the pick-up location is Toronto Pearson International Airport. The drop-off location is near the attraction. 

So, first, get the coordinates of the airport for pick-up. The Search_Car_Location tool can be used with query "Toronto Pearson International Airport" to get the coordinates. Then, for the drop-off, after visiting the attraction, the user will return the car near the attraction. So, I need the coordinates of the attraction's location. 

But how do I get the attraction's coordinates? The Search_Attraction_Location might return that. Let me think. When I call Search_Attraction_Location with "Toronto", it might return a list of attractions, each with their own coordinates. Then, once I find the most trending one, I can get its coordinates from that response. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Attraction_Location with query "Toronto" to get attraction IDs and their locations.
2. From the results, identify the most trending attraction (maybe based on some score in the response).
3. Get the coordinates of that attraction for the drop-off location.
4. Use Search_Car_Rentals with pick-up at the airport (coordinates from Search_Car_Location) and drop-off at the attraction's coordinates.
5. Calculate the return date and time: the user is leaving at 2 PM on Nov 12th, and returning 26 hours later, which would be 4 PM on Nov 13th. So the drop-off date is Nov 13th, 16:00. 

Wait, the user is at the airport at 2 PM on Nov 12th. Renting the car would be at that time. The return is 26 hours later, so adding 26 hours to 2 PM Nov 12th: 2 PM + 24 hours is 2 PM Nov 13th, plus 2 more hours is 4 PM Nov 13th. So the drop-off date is 2024-11-13, and time is 16:00. 

But the Search_Car_Rentals requires pick_up_date, pick_up_time, drop_off_date, drop_off_time, and the coordinates. So I need to get the airport's coordinates first. 

So first, call Search_Car_Location with query "Toronto Pearson International Airport" to get the coordinates for pick-up. Then, call Search_Attraction_Location with "Toronto" to get the attraction list. Then, use Search_Attractions with the ID from the most trending attraction to get more details, including its coordinates. 

Wait, but the Search_Attractions tool requires an 'id' parameter, which is obtained from Search_Attraction_Location. So the process is:

- Call Search_Attraction_Location with "Toronto" to get a list of attractions, each with an 'id'.
- Then, for each attraction, use Search_Attractions with that 'id' and sort by 'trending' to get the most trending one. Wait, no, the Search_Attractions tool's 'sortBy' parameter can be 'trending', so maybe the initial call to Search_Attraction_Location gives the list, and then we can sort them based on some criteria. But the parameters for Search_Attractions require an 'id' and 'sortBy'. 

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Attraction_Location already returns the attractions sorted by trending. But the description of Search_Attraction_Location says it's for finding attractions by location, address, etc., and returns info like slug, productId, id. The Search_Attractions tool is for searching by location ID and sorting by trending, etc. 

So perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Use Search_Attraction_Location with query "Toronto" to get a list of attractions in Toronto. This will give us the 'id's of the attractions.
2. Then, for each of these 'id's, call Search_Attractions with the same 'id' and sortBy "trending" to get the most trending one. Wait, but that might not be necessary. Maybe the Search_Attraction_Location already returns the attractions sorted by some criteria. However, the user wants the most trending, so perhaps the Search_Attractions tool is needed. 

Alternatively, maybe the Search_Attraction_Location returns a list of attractions, and the 'trending' is part of the data. But the parameters for Search_Attractions include 'sortBy' which can be 'trending', so perhaps the correct approach is to first get the list of attractions in Toronto, then use their IDs to call Search_Attractions with sortBy "trending" to get the most trending one. 

But this seems a bit convoluted. Let me check the parameters again. 

The Search_Attractions tool requires an 'id' parameter, which is obtained from Search_Attraction_Location. So, the 'id' is the location ID. Wait, the description says: "id can be retrieved from api/v1/attraction/searchLocation (Search Attraction Location) endpoint in Attraction collection as id inside products or destinations." So, the 'id' parameter in Search_Attractions is the location ID, not the attraction ID. 

Wait, that's confusing. Let me re-read the description. 

For Search_Attractions: "id can be retrieved from api/v1/attraction/searchLocation (Search Attraction Location) endpoint in Attraction collection as id inside products or destinations." So, the 'id' parameter is the location ID, not the attraction ID. So, the Search_Attractions tool is for searching attractions within a specific location (like a city or area) and sorting them by trending, etc. 

So, the process would be:

1. Use Search_Attraction_Location with query "Toronto" to get the location ID for Toronto. Then, use that location ID in Search_Attractions with sortBy "trending" to get the most trending attractions in Toronto. 

Wait, but the 'id' parameter in Search_Attractions is the location ID. So, if I first get the location ID for Toronto via Search_Attraction_Location, then use that ID in Search_Attractions with sortBy "trending" to get the most trending attractions in that location. 

So, step-by-step:

1. Call Search_Attraction_Location with query "Toronto" to get the location ID for Toronto. Let's say the response includes a location ID, say "toronto_id".
2. Then, call Search_Attractions with id="toronto_id" and sortBy="trending" to get the most trending attractions in Toronto. The response would include the attraction details, including their IDs and locations.
3. Once we have the most trending attraction, we need its coordinates for the drop-off location. But how? The Search_Attractions response might include coordinates, or we might need to call another tool. 

Alternatively, the Search_Attraction_Location might return the attraction's coordinates. But the initial call to Search_Attraction_Location with "Toronto" might return a list of attractions in Toronto, each with their own details. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the steps again:

- To find the most trending attraction in Toronto, first get the location ID for Toronto using Search_Attraction_Location.
- Then, use that location ID in Search_Attractions with sortBy "trending" to get the list of attractions in Toronto sorted by trending.
- The first result would be the most trending attraction. Then, get its coordinates (maybe from the Search_Attractions response or another tool).
- Then, use Search_Car_Rentals with pick-up at the airport (coordinates from Search_Car_Location
