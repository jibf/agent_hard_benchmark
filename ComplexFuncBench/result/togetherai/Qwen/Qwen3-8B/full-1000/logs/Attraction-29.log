2025-08-15 01:00:48,008 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-29 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about Times Square, and I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Times Square" as the query. That gave me a product slug for a photoshoot. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug. The response has a lot of info.

Now, I need to present this in a helpful way. The user might want to know what the photoshoot includes, pricing, cancellation policy, and maybe how to book. The description mentions professional photos, expert guides, and includes high-quality images. The price is $107.49 USD. The cancellation policy allows free cancellation. Also, the attraction is operated by Picster, and they mention wheelchair accessibility and bringing a ticket. 

I should structure the answer to highlight key points: what's included, price, cancellation policy, and practical info like accessibility. Maybe mention the operated by and how to book if possible. Keep it clear and concise, avoiding too much jargon. Make sure to note the representative price and any terms and conditions mentioned.
