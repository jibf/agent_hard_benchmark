Okay, the user wants to find three hotels within 3 kilometers of the Dallas Museum of Art and check their details and payment methods. Let me see.

First, they used the Search_Hotel_Destination tool with the query "Dallas Museum of Art". The response gave a dest_id of 61127, which is a landmark. Then they tried to use Search_Hotels with parameters including radius set to 3000, but the system said the function doesn't have a radius parameter. Oh right, the Search_Hotels function's parameters don't include radius. So that's a problem. How else can they get hotels within 3 km?

Wait, maybe the Search_HotelsByCoordinates endpoint can be used instead. The user might need to get the latitude and longitude from the previous response. The Dallas Museum of Art's coordinates are latitude 32.78774 and longitude -96.80018. Then, using those coordinates, they can search for hotels within a 3 km radius. But the available tools don't have a Search_HotelsByCoordinates function. Wait, looking back at the tools provided, there is a Search_HotelsByCoordinates endpoint. Let me check the tools again.

Yes, the Search_HotelsByCoordinates is in the list. The parameters are latitude and longitude. So the next step should be to call Search_HotelsByCoordinates with the coordinates from the first response. Then, retrieve the hotel IDs and use Get_Hotel_Details and Payment_features_of_the_Hotel for each. But the user wants three hotels, so maybe after getting the list, select the top three and check their details and payment methods. Let me structure the steps again.

First, get the coordinates from the Search_Hotel_Destination response. Then use Search_HotelsByCoordinates with those coordinates to find hotels nearby. Then, for each hotel, get details and payment info. But the user might need to adjust the radius parameter in the Search_HotelsByCoordinates. Wait, the parameters for Search_HotelsByCoordinates are latitude and longitude, but there's no radius parameter. Hmm, maybe the radius is handled by the API's default or another parameter. Alternatively, maybe the initial approach was wrong, and the user needs to use the Search_Hotels endpoint with the dest_id and adjust the search_type or other parameters. But since the Search_Hotels doesn't have a radius, perhaps the user needs to use the Search_HotelsByCoordinates with the coordinates and then filter the results. However, the available tools don't have a way to specify a radius in that endpoint. So maybe the user has to proceed with the existing data and use the dest_id from the landmark, but without the radius, the results might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the Search_Hotels endpoint can take a radius parameter, but the previous error indicated that it's not available. So the correct approach is to use Search_HotelsByCoordinates with the coordinates from the first response, then get the hotel IDs and proceed. Let me check the tools again.

Looking at the tools, the Search_HotelsByCoordinates is present. The parameters are latitude and longitude. So the next step is to call that endpoint with the coordinates from the first response. Then, the response should list hotels near that location. Once the hotels are found, retrieve their details and payment methods. So the next tool call should be Search_HotelsByCoordinates with the given latitude and longitude.
