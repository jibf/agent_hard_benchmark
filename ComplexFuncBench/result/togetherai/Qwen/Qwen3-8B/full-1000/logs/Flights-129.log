Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel from Washington to Miami and Orlando, staying 5 days each, then return. They're unsure about the order (Miami first or Orlando first) and want the cheapest flight departing around December 18, 2024, with detailed info.

First, I need to figure out the possible itineraries. Since they can choose the order, I should consider both options: Washington to Miami first, then Orlando, and vice versa. But the user mentioned "return to Washington," so the return trip would be from Orlando back to Washington. Wait, actually, the return trip would depend on the order. If they go Miami then Orlando, the return would be Orlando to Washington. If they go Orlando then Miami, the return would be Miami to Washington. But the user hasn't decided the order, so maybe I need to check both possibilities.

But the user is asking for the departure date around December 18th. So the outbound trip would start on or around that date. However, the return date isn't specified. The user might be looking for a round-trip itinerary, but the problem is that the return date isn't mentioned. Wait, the user says they stay 5 days in each place. So if they depart on December 18, they'd arrive in the first city, stay 5 days, then go to the second city, stay 5 days, then return. So the return date would be around December 30th (18 + 5 + 5 = 28, but maybe they leave the second city on the 28th, so return flight would be on the 28th or 29th). But the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe they just want the outbound flights, but the problem says "return to Washington," so it's a round trip. However, the user hasn't given the return date, so perhaps the return date is flexible, but the main focus is on the departure date around Dec 18th.

But the user's main request is to find the cheapest flight departure around Dec 18th. So the outbound trip would be from Washington to either Miami or Orlando, then to the other city, and return. But the user hasn't decided the order, so I need to check both possibilities for the cheapest option.

But the tools available are for multi-stop flights. So the legs would be Washington to Miami, then Miami to Orlando, then Orlando back to Washington. Or Washington to Orlando, then Orlando to Miami, then Miami back to Washington. But the user is asking for the departure date around Dec 18th. So the first leg's departure date would be around Dec 18th. The return leg would be after the 5 days in each city. So the return date would be Dec 18 + 5 + 5 = Dec 28th, so the return flight would depart on Dec 28th. But the user might be flexible with the return date, but the problem states "around December 18th" for departure, so maybe the return is also around that date? Wait, the user says "departure date of the cheapest flight around December 18th," so the outbound trip starts on or around Dec 18th, and the return trip would be after the stay. So the return date would be Dec 28th, but the user might not have specified that. However, the user hasn't mentioned the return date, so perhaps the return is also flexible, but the main focus is on the departure date.

But the user wants the cheapest flight around Dec 18th. So the first step is to search for multi-stop flights from Washington to Miami and Orlando, then back. But since the user hasn't decided the order, I need to check both options. However, the user might not want to consider both, but the assistant should check both possibilities to find the cheapest one.

But the tools available are Search_Flights_Multi_Stops and Get_Flight_Details. So first, I need to find the legs for both possible itineraries. Let's outline the two options:

Option 1: Washington -> Miami (Dec 18) -> Orlando (Dec 23) -> Washington (Dec 28)
Option 2: Washington -> Orlando (Dec 18) -> Miami (Dec 23) -> Washington (Dec 28)

But the user might not need the return date to be exactly Dec 28, but the return flight would be after the 5 days in each city. However, the user hasn't specified the return date, so maybe the return date is flexible. But the user's main query is about the departure date around Dec 18th, so the first leg's departure date is Dec 18th. The return leg's departure date would be after the 5 days in each city. But the user might not have specified the return date, so perhaps the return flight is also around Dec 18th? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the user is staying 5 days in each place, so the total trip duration is 10 days. So if they depart on Dec 18, they would return on Dec 28. So the return flight would be on Dec 28. But the user hasn't mentioned the return date, so maybe the return is also around Dec 18th? That's conflicting. But the user's main request is about the departure date, so the return date is not specified. However, the user wants to return to Washington, so the return flight is necessary.

But the user hasn't provided the return date, so perhaps the return flight is also flexible. However, the user is asking for the departure date around Dec 18th, so the outbound trip starts on that date, and the return trip would be after the stay. So the return flight would be on Dec 28th. But the user might not have specified that, so maybe the return date is also around Dec 18th? That's unclear. However, the user's main focus is on the departure date, so the assistant should focus on the outbound trip's departure date around Dec 18th.

But the user is asking for the cheapest flight around Dec 18th, which would be the outbound trip. However, the return trip is also part of the multi-stop flight. So the multi-stop flight would include the outbound and return legs. Wait, the user's trip is Washington to Miami and Orlando, then back to Washington. So the multi-stop flight would have three legs: Washington to Miami, Miami to Orlando, Orlando to Washington. Or Washington to Orlando, Orlando to Miami, Miami to Washington. So the legs array would have three entries for each itinerary.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so the return leg's date would be after the 5 days in each city. So if the first leg departs on Dec 18, the second leg would depart on Dec 23 (after 5 days in Miami), and the third leg would depart on Dec 28 (after 5 days in Orlando). So the return flight would be on Dec 28. But the user might not have specified that, so the assistant needs to consider that.

So the first step is to search for multi-stop flights for both itineraries (Miami first or Orlando first) with the first leg departing around Dec 18th. Then, find the cheapest one. Then, get the detailed information for that flight.

But the user hasn't specified the number of adults or children, so the default is 1 adult. Also, the cabin class isn't specified, so maybe default to economy. The user might want the cheapest, so economy is likely.

So the steps would be:

1. Search for multi-stop flights for both itineraries (Washington to Miami then Orlando, then back; and Washington to Orlando then Miami, then back). The legs for each itinerary would be:

Option 1:
- Leg 1: Washington to Miami, date Dec 18
- Leg 2: Miami to Orlando, date Dec 23
- Leg 3: Orlando to Washington, date Dec 28

Option 2:
- Leg 1: Washington to Orlando, date Dec 18
- Leg 2: Orlando to Miami, date Dec 23
- Leg 3: Miami to Washington, date Dec 28

But the user might not have specified the return date, so the return leg's date is Dec 28. However, the user might be flexible with the return date, but the main focus is on the departure date around Dec 18th. So the assistant should search for both options and find the cheapest.

But the user hasn't specified the return date, so the return leg's date is Dec 28. However, the user might not want to return on Dec 28, but the problem states that they stay 5 days in each place, so the return date would be Dec 28. So the legs are fixed for each itinerary.

So the first step is to call the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops API for both itineraries, with the legs as described. Then, compare the prices and find the cheapest one. Then, get the detailed information for that flight.

But the user hasn't specified the number of adults or children, so the default is 1 adult. Also, the cabin class is not specified, so the default might be economy. The sort parameter should be set to CHEAPEST to find the cheapest flights.

So the first tool call would be to Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for Option 1, then for Option 2. Then, compare the results and choose the cheaper one. Then, use the token from the cheapest flight
