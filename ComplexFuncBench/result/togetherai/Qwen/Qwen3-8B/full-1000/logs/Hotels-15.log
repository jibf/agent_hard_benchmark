2025-08-15 00:37:43,892 - evaluation_logger_Hotels-15 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user is asking for detailed information about all available hotel rooms within 100 kilometers of their current location, which has coordinates 40.9042 latitude and 106.4074 longitude. They want this for tonight, so the dates would be arrival on November 25th and departure on November 26th, 2024.

First, I need to check which tool to use. The user provided coordinates, so the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool seems appropriate. The parameters required are arrival_date, departure_date, latitude, longitude, and optionally radius, which defaults to 100 km. The user specified 100 km, so that's covered.

Looking at the tool's parameters, I need to make sure all required fields are included. The required ones are arrival_date, departure_date, latitude, longitude, and radius is optional but the user mentioned 100 km. So the arguments would be:

arrival_date: 2024-11-25
departure_date: 2024-11-26
radius: 100
latitude: 40.9042
longitude: 106.4074

Wait, the user's current location is at 40.9042, 106.4074, but the tool's example uses different coordinates. However, the user's input is clear, so I should use their provided coordinates. 

After making the tool call, the response came back with a single hotel result. The data includes details like hotel name, price, availability, and other amenities. The user wants detailed information about all available rooms, so I need to present this data clearly.

The response has a hotel named "Ramada by Wyndham Bayannur" with a price of CNY 298.46. The room details mention 1 bed, and it's free to cancel. The check-in is from 14:00, and check-out until 14:00. The review score is 10, which is exceptional. 

I should structure the answer to highlight the hotel name, price, availability, check-in/check-out times, and the review score. Also, mention that there's only one hotel found within the radius. Since the user asked for all available rooms, but only one was found, it's important to note that. 

I need to make sure the currency is mentioned, as the price is in CNY. Also, the user might be interested in the included taxes and charges, but the response shows that taxes are excluded. However, the total price includes VAT and service charges. 

The user might not need all the technical details, so summarizing the key points would be better. Also, check if there are any other parameters the user might need, like room types or amenities, but the response doesn't have that info. 

Finally, confirm that the information is for tonight's stay and that the hotel is within the specified radius. Since the tool's response includes the hotel's coordinates, it's safe to assume it's within 100 km. 

So the final answer should list the hotel details clearly, mention the price, availability, and any other relevant info like the review score and cancellation policy.
