Okay, let's tackle the user's request step by step. They want to travel from Miami to Berlin departing on December 10, 2024, and returning on December 17, 2024. They're asking for the cheapest air tickets around those dates, detailed flight info, and a seat map.

First, I need to figure out which tools to use. The user mentioned both flight details and a seat map, so I'll need to use the Search_Flights tool to find the cheapest options. But wait, there's also the Get_Min_Price tool which might help find the minimum prices around the specified dates. However, the user specified exact dates, so maybe the Search_Flights with sort parameter set to CHEAPEST would be better. But the Get_Min_Price tool looks for prices within 5 days before and after the query date, which might give a broader range. However, the user wants around December 10 and 17, so maybe using Get_Min_Price for both dates could help find the cheapest options. But the user also wants detailed flight info and seat map, which requires the token from Search_Flights or Get_Flight_Details. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price tool returns the lowest priced flights within 5 days before and after the query date. So if I use that for both departDate (Dec 10) and returnDate (Dec 17), it might give the cheapest options around those dates. Then, once I have the minimum prices, I can use the Search_Flights tool with the specific dates to get the flight details and then the seat map. But the user might need the exact dates, so maybe the initial step is to use Get_Min_Price to find the cheapest options around the dates, then use Search_Flights with the exact dates to get the details. However, the user might prefer the exact dates, so perhaps using Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST for the specific dates. 

Alternatively, the Get_Min_Price could help find the cheapest prices, but the user wants the flights around those dates. Let me check the parameters. The Get_Min_Price requires departDate and returnDate, and it searches within 5 days before and after. So if the user's dates are Dec 10 and 17, the Get_Min_Price would look for flights from Dec 5 to Dec 15 for departure and Dec 12 to Dec 22 for return. But the user wants flights on Dec 10 and 17. Maybe the user is flexible with the dates, so using Get_Min_Price could find cheaper options. However, the user specified exact dates, so maybe the Search_Flights with the exact dates is better. 

But the user is asking for the cheapest around those dates, so perhaps using Get_Min_Price first to find the minimum prices, then using Search_Flights with the exact dates to get the flight details. However, the Get_Min_Price might not provide the exact flight details, only the minimum price. So maybe the correct approach is to first use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST for the exact dates, then use Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info and then Get_Seat_Map. 

Wait, the user also mentioned returning on Dec 17, so the return flight is from Berlin to Miami. So the Search_Flights would need to be done for both directions. But the user might need to first find the cheapest options for the outbound and return flights. 

So the steps would be:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get the fromId (Miami) and toId (Berlin). The user mentioned Miami and Berlin, so I need to find their airport IDs. 

Wait, the Search_Flight_Location tool is used to find airports by query. So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" to get the fromId, and query "Berlin" to get the toId. 

But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so I need to use the Search_Flight_Location to get the correct IDs. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Miami to get fromId, and for Berlin to get toId. 

Once I have those IDs, then proceed to search for flights. 

But the user's initial request doesn't mention specific airports, just cities. So the first step is to find the airport IDs for Miami and Berlin. 

Then, use Search_Flights with the fromId, toId, departDate (Dec 10), and sort by CHEAPEST. Similarly for the return flight, use toId as Berlin, fromId as Miami, returnDate as Dec 17, and sort by CHEAPEST. 

But the user also wants detailed flight info and seat map. So after getting the flight details via Search_Flights, the token can be used to get the flight details with Get_Flight_Details, and then the seat map with Get_Seat_Map. 

But the user might need to first find the cheapest flights, so the initial step is to use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST for both outbound and return dates. 

Alternatively, using Get_Min_Price for the departDate and returnDate to find the minimum prices, but that might not give the exact flight details. 

But the user wants detailed flight info and seat map, so the Search_Flights is necessary to get the token, which is required for Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map. 

So the plan is:

1. Search for Miami's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location.
2. Search for Berlin's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location.
3. Use Search_Flights with fromId (Miami), toId (Berlin), departDate (Dec 10), sort=CHEAPEST to get the cheapest outbound flights.
4. Use Search_Flights again for the return trip: fromId (Berlin), toId (Miami), returnDate (Dec 17), sort=CHEAPEST.
5. For each flight, get the token and then use Get_Flight_Details to get detailed info.
6. Use Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken from the flight details to get the seat map.

But the user might need to first get the airport IDs. So the first two steps are necessary. 

However, the user's message doesn't mention needing to find the airport IDs, but the tools require them. So the assistant needs to call Search_Flight_Location for both cities. 

So the first tool call should be Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" to get the fromId, and another call for "Berlin" to get the toId. 

Once those are obtained, proceed with Search_Flights for the outbound and return trips. 

But the user's initial request is to find the cheapest tickets around the dates, so maybe the Get_Min_Price tool is more appropriate for the initial search. However, the Get_Min_Price requires departDate and returnDate, and it returns the minimum prices within 5 days before and after. But the user wants flights on specific dates. 

Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. The user wants flights on Dec 10 and 17, but the Get_Min_Price would look for flights around those dates. However, the user might be flexible with the dates, so using Get_Min_Price could find cheaper options. But the user specified exact dates, so maybe the Search_Flights with the exact dates is better. 

But the user is asking for the cheapest around those dates, so perhaps using Get_Min_Price for both departDate and returnDate would help find the cheapest options. However, the Get_Min_Price might not provide the exact flight details, only the minimum price. 

Alternatively, the Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST for the exact dates would give the cheapest flights on those specific dates. 

So the correct approach is to first use Search_Flights with the exact dates and sort by CHEAPEST to get the cheapest options on those dates. Then, use Get_Flight_Details to get detailed info and Get_Seat_Map. 

But to do that, the fromId and toId are needed, which requires Search_Flight_Location. 

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for Miami and Berlin to get their IDs. 

Therefore, the first tool calls should be Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" and "Berlin". 

Once those IDs are obtained, then proceed with Search_Flights for the outbound and return trips. 

But the user's message doesn't mention needing to find the airport IDs, but the tools require them. So the assistant must call those tools first. 

So the initial tool calls are Search_Flight_Location for Miami and Berlin. 

Then, using the obtained IDs, call Search_Flights for the outbound and return flights. 

Then, for each flight, get the token and use Get_Flight_Details and Get_Seat_Map. 

But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so the Search_Flight_Location is necessary. 

Therefore, the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for both cities. 

So the first two tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami"
2. Search_Flight_Location with query "Berlin"

Then, using the fromId and toId from those responses, call Search_Flights for the outbound and return trips. 

But the user's initial request is to find the cheapest tickets around the dates, so the Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST would be appropriate. 

Once the flights are found, the detailed info and seat map can be retrieved. 

So the assistant needs to make these steps in order. 

But the user's question is to find the cheapest tickets around the dates, so the first step is to get the airport IDs, then search for flights, then get details and seat map. 

Therefore, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for Miami and Berlin.
