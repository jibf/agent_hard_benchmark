Okay, let's tackle the user's request step by step. The user wants to check the detailed information of the fastest flight from Nanjing to Miami on December 5, 2024, and also find hotel availability within 20 kilometers of the airport on that day.

First, I need to figure out the flight details. The user mentioned the fastest flight, so I should use the Search_Flights endpoint with the sort parameter set to FASTEST. But wait, the Search_Flights requires fromId and toId, which are airport IDs. The user provided city names (Nanjing and Miami), so I need to get the airport IDs for these cities. 

Looking at the available tools, there's a Search_Flight_Location endpoint that can find airports by location. So I should first call that to get the fromId (Nanjing's airport ID) and toId (Miami's airport ID). Let me check the parameters: the query parameter takes the city name. So I'll call Search_Flight_Location with "Nanjing" and "Miami" respectively.

Once I have the fromId and toId, I can use them in the Search_Flights endpoint. The departDate is December 5, 2024. The sort parameter should be FASTEST. The required parameters for Search_Flights are toId, fromId, and departDate. So after getting the airport IDs, I can make that call. Then, the response will include a token, which is needed for Get_Flight_Details to get the detailed info.

Next, for the hotel availability. The user wants hotels within 20 kilometers of the airport. But which airport? The departure airport is Nanjing, so I need the coordinates of Nanjing's airport. Wait, the user might mean the arrival airport in Miami, but the question says "within 20 kilometers of the airport on that day." Since the flight is from Nanjing to Miami, the user might be interested in hotels near the arrival airport (Miami) or the departure airport (Nanjing). But the user didn't specify, so maybe I should check both? However, the user might be referring to the arrival airport. Alternatively, maybe they want hotels near the departure airport. Hmm, the query is a bit ambiguous. But since the user mentioned "on that day," which is December 5, 2024, the arrival date is the same as the departure date. Wait, the flight is on December 5, so the arrival would be on the same day. But the user might want hotels near the arrival airport (Miami) for the stay after arriving. However, the user might not have specified, so perhaps I should check both? But the user might be referring to the departure airport. Alternatively, maybe the user wants hotels near the departure airport (Nanjing) for the departure day. But the problem is that the user is asking for hotels within 20 km of the airport on that day (December 5). So the flight is on that day, so the hotels would be near the departure or arrival airport. But the user might need both? Or maybe the user is planning to stay in Miami after arriving. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should check both airports. However, the user might have intended the arrival airport. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for hotels near the departure airport. But the problem is that the user hasn't specified which airport. 

Wait, the user's query says "availability of hotels within 20 kilometers of the airport on that day." The airport in question is likely the arrival airport, as the departure is from Nanjing. But the user might not have specified. However, since the flight is from Nanjing to Miami, the arrival airport is Miami. So the user probably wants hotels near Miami's airport. But to confirm, maybe I should first get the airport IDs for both cities, then get their coordinates. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Nanjing to get fromId, and for Miami to get toId. Then, use the fromId and toId in Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST. Once I have the flight details, then for the hotel, I need the coordinates of the arrival airport (Miami) to use in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates. But to get the coordinates, I need to use Location_to_Lat_Long with the query as Miami's airport name. Wait, but the Search_Flight_Location gives the airport's ID, but maybe the name of the airport is needed for the location. Alternatively, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long can take the city name. For example, if the user wants the coordinates of Miami airport, but the exact name might be needed. However, the user might not have the exact airport name, so using the city name might be sufficient. 

Alternatively, after getting the toId (Miami's airport ID), perhaps the Search_Flight_Location can be used again to get the airport's name, but the endpoint's description says it returns the airport's location ID. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location endpoint's description says it returns the airport's location ID. Wait, the parameters for Search_Flight_Location are a query, which can be the airport name, city, etc. The response would include the id of the airport. But to get the coordinates, maybe the Location_to_Lat_Long can be used with the airport's name. For example, if the airport is Miami International Airport, then querying "Miami International Airport" would get the coordinates. But the user might not know the exact name, so using the city name "Miami" might be sufficient. 

So the steps would be:

1. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Nanjing" to get fromId (Nanjing's airport ID).
2. Call Search_Flight_Location with query "Miami" to get toId (Miami's airport ID).
3. Use fromId and toId in Search_Flights with departDate=2024-12-05 and sort=FASTEST to get the flight details. The response will include a token.
4. Use the token in Get_Flight_Details to get detailed flight info.
5. For hotels, need the coordinates of the arrival airport (Miami). So call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami" to get latitude and longitude.
6. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-12-05, departure_date=2024-12-05 (assuming the user is staying one night), radius=20 km. Wait, the user said "within 20 kilometers of the airport on that day." The arrival date is December 5, so the arrival is on that day, and the departure would be the next day. But the user might be checking for hotels on the same day, so maybe arrival_date and departure_date are both 2024-12-05? Or perhaps the user wants hotels for the night of the 5th, so arrival_date is 2024-12-05 and departure_date is 2024-12-06. But the user's query is a bit unclear. However, the user might be looking for hotels on the day of arrival, so the arrival_date is 2024-12-05 and departure_date is 2024-12-06. But the exact dates need to be clarified. However, the user hasn't specified the number of nights, so perhaps the default is one night. 

But the user's query says "availability of hotels within 20 kilometers of the airport on that day." So "that day" refers to December 5, 2024. So the user might be looking for hotels available on that day, which could mean the check-in date is December 5, and check-out is December 6. So the arrival_date is 2024-12-05 and departure_date is 2024-12-06. 

So, after getting the coordinates of the airport (Miami), use them in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-12-05, departure_date=2024-12-06, radius=20, and other parameters as needed. 

But first, I need to get the coordinates of the airport. So step 5 is to call Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami" to get the latitude and longitude. 

So the tool calls would be:

1. Search_Flight_Location for Nanjing to get fromId.
2. Search_Flight_Location for Miami to get toId.
3. Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate=2024-12-05, sort=FASTEST.
4. Get_Flight_Details with the token from step 3.
5. Location_to_Lat_Long with query "Miami" to get coordinates.
6. Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with arrival_date=2024-12-05, departure_date=2024-12-06, radius=20, latitude and longitude from step 5.

But the user might not have specified the exact airport, so using the city name might not be accurate. For example, Miami has multiple airports, like Miami International, Miami-Dade, etc. But the user might not know the exact name, so using "Miami" as the query in Location_to_Lat_Long might return the main airport's coordinates. 

Alternatively, after getting the toId from Search_Flight_Location for Miami, perhaps the endpoint returns the airport's name, which can be used in Location_to_Lat_Long. But the Search_Flight_Location's response isn
