2025-08-15 01:03:12,759 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-28 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about the Tokyo Tower, and I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Tokyo Tower" as the query. That gave me a product slug for the Red Tokyo Tower Night Ticket. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with that slug.

Now, the response from Get_Attraction_Details has a lot of information. The user probably wants a clear summary of what the attraction is like, what's included, any restrictions, and maybe booking details. Let me parse through the data.

The description mentions it's a digital playground in Tokyo Tower with high-tech attractions across three floors. They list various activities like AR games, VR rides, and a robot fight. The price is $25.29 USD. The additional info includes wheelchair access, service animals allowed, and some health warnings. There's a free cancellation policy, which is good. The ticket requires being 18 or accompanied by an adult. 

I should structure the answer to highlight the key points: what the attraction offers, included amenities, important notes (like age requirements and health advisories), pricing, and booking info. Also, mention the cancellation policy and any other terms. Make sure it's easy to read and covers all essential details the user might need.
