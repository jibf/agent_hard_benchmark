I need to book the tickets separately in case my plans change. I'm going to stay in Chicago and Boston for two days each. Please provide hotels within 20 kilometers of the related airports in Chicago and Boston based on the arrival airports of the flights.

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. First, they want the fastest plane tickets from Vancouver to Chicago on December 1, 2024, and then from Chicago to Boston on December 3, 2024. They also need hotel recommendations within 20 km of the airports in Chicago and Boston based on the arrival airports. 

Starting with the flights: The user mentioned "fastest" so I should use the Search_Flights tool with sort parameter set to FASTEST. For the first leg, Vancouver to Chicago, I need the fromId and toId. But wait, the user hasn't provided the airport IDs yet. So I need to first find the airport IDs for Vancouver and Chicago using the Search_Flight_Location tool. Similarly for Chicago to Boston, I'll need the airport IDs for Chicago and Boston.

Wait, but the user might not know the airport IDs. So the first step is to search for the locations. Let me check the Search_Flight_Location parameters. The query parameter is needed. So I should call Search_Flight_Location with "Vancouver" to get the fromId for Vancouver, and "Chicago" for the toId. Then do the same for Chicago to Boston. 

Once I have the airport IDs, I can use Search_Flights with sort=FASTEST, departDate as 2024-12-01 for the first flight and 2024-12-03 for the second. Also, the user mentioned booking separately, so maybe they need the flight details for each leg. After getting the flight tokens, I can use Get_Flight_Details to get more info like baggage allowances, etc. But the user might just need the fastest options, so maybe the initial search is enough.

Next, the hotels. The user wants hotels within 20 km of the airports in Chicago and Boston based on the arrival airports. So after getting the flight details, I need the arrival airport's coordinates. Wait, the user said "based on the arrival airports of the flights." So for the first flight (Vancouver to Chicago), the arrival airport is Chicago's airport. Then for the second flight (Chicago to Boston), the arrival is Boston's airport. 

To get the hotel coordinates, I need the latitude and longitude of those airports. But the user hasn't provided them yet. So after getting the flight details, I can extract the arrival airport's location. Alternatively, maybe I can get the airport's coordinates via the Search_Flight_Location again? Wait, the Search_Flight_Location gives the airport's id, but the user might need the coordinates. Wait, the Location_to_Lat_Long tool can convert a location name to coordinates. But the user might need the airport's name. For example, Chicago has O'Hare and Midway airports. So maybe the user needs to specify which airport, but they might not. So perhaps after getting the flight details, the arrival airport's name can be used to get the coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe the flight details include the airport codes, which can be used to search for the location. But the tools available don't have a way to get airport codes from the flight search. Hmm. 

Wait, the user wants hotels near the arrival airports. So for the first flight, arrival is Chicago. So I need to get the coordinates of Chicago's airport. But which one? Maybe the user doesn't specify, so perhaps the first step is to get the airport IDs for Chicago and Boston, then use those to find their coordinates. Wait, the Search_Flight_Location gives the airport's id, but the Location_to_Lat_Long tool can take a query like "Chicago O'Hare" to get the coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe the flight search results include the airport codes, but the tools don't mention that. So perhaps the process is:

1. For each flight leg, find the airport IDs using Search_Flight_Location with the city names (Vancouver, Chicago, Boston).
2. Use those airport IDs in the flight search to get the flight details, which might include the arrival airport's name or code.
3. Then, use the arrival airport's name (e.g., Chicago O'Hare) in the Location_to_Lat_Long tool to get the coordinates.
4. Then, use those coordinates in the Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates tool with radius 20 km.

But the user might not have specified which airports, so maybe the initial step is to get the airport IDs for the cities, then proceed. However, the user might need to specify which airports, but since they didn't, we have to assume the main ones. 

So the steps would be:

First, get the airport IDs for Vancouver (fromId), Chicago (toId for first flight), Chicago (fromId for second flight), and Boston (toId for second flight). 

Then, search for flights from Vancouver to Chicago on 2024-12-01, sorted by FASTEST. Then, search for flights from Chicago to Boston on 2024-12-03, sorted by FASTEST. 

Once the flight details are obtained, get the arrival airport's name (e.g., Chicago O'Hare) and use that to get the coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long. Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 20 km, arrival and departure dates based on the flight dates. 

But the user mentioned staying in Chicago and Boston for two days each. So for the first leg, arrival in Chicago on Dec 1, then departure on Dec 3. Wait, the first flight is Dec 1, so arrival in Chicago on Dec 1. Then, they stay for two days, so departure from Chicago on Dec 3. Then the second flight is Dec 3 from Chicago to Boston, arriving on Dec 3, staying two days, departing on Dec 5. But the user hasn't mentioned the departure date from Boston. However, the user's request is to stay in Chicago and Boston for two days each, so the departure from Boston would be on Dec 5. But the user hasn't specified the departure date from Boston, so maybe the hotels in Boston are for arrival on Dec 3 and departure on Dec 5. 

But the user's initial request is to check the fastest tickets for the two legs, and then hotels based on the arrival airports. So the hotels in Chicago would be for arrival on Dec 1 (from Vancouver) and departure on Dec 3 (to Boston). The hotels in Boston would be for arrival on Dec 3 (from Chicago) and departure on Dec 5. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for flight from Vancouver to Chicago on 2024-12-01, sorted by FASTEST. Need to get fromId (Vancouver) and toId (Chicago). But first, need to get the airport IDs for Vancouver and Chicago using Search_Flight_Location.

2. Then, search for flight from Chicago to Boston on 2024-12-03, sorted by FASTEST. Again, need fromId (Chicago) and toId (Boston). So need to get airport IDs for Chicago and Boston.

Wait, but the user might have multiple airports in each city. For example, Chicago has O'Hare and Midway. So the initial step is to get the airport IDs for each city. But the Search_Flight_Location tool's query parameter is the name of the location. So for Vancouver, query "Vancouver" to get the fromId. For Chicago, query "Chicago" to get the toId for the first flight. Then, for the second flight, fromId would be Chicago's airport ID, and toId for Boston. 

But the user might not have specified which airports, so the tool might return multiple results. However, the user might need to select the main ones. But since the user hasn't specified, we can proceed with the first result or assume the main airport. 

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver, Chicago, and Boston to get their airport IDs. Then use those in the flight searches. 

Once the flight details are obtained, the arrival airports are Chicago (for the first flight) and Boston (for the second). Then, get the coordinates of those airports using Location_to_Lat_Long with the airport names (e.g., Chicago O'Hare, Boston Logan). Then, use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates with radius 20 km, arrival and departure dates as per the user's stay. 

But the user's stay in Chicago is two days, so arrival on Dec 1, departure on Dec 3. So for Chicago hotels, arrival_date is 2024-12-01, departure_date 2024-12-03. For Boston, arrival on 2024-12-03, departure on 2024-12-05. 

So the plan is:

1. Use Search_Flight_Location to get airport IDs for Vancouver, Chicago, and Boston.
2. Use Search_Flights for Vancouver to Chicago on 2024-12-01, sorted by FASTEST.
3. Use Search_Flights for Chicago to Boston on 2024-12-03, sorted by FASTEST.
4. For each flight, get the arrival airport's name (e.g., Chicago O'Hare, Boston Logan) to get their coordinates via Location_to_Lat_Long.
5. Use those coordinates in Search_Hotels_By_Coordinates for each city with the respective dates and radius 20 km.

But the user might need the flight details first to get the arrival airports. So the process is sequential. 

Now, the user's initial request is to check the fastest
