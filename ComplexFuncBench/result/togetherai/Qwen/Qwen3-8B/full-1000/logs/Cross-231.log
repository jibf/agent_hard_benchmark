Okay, let's tackle this user's request step by step. First, they want the cheapest flight from Philadelphia to Denver on December 20, 2024, without overnight layovers. Then, a hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver for five days, and a taxi from the airport to the hotel an hour after landing.

Starting with the flight. The user mentioned "cheapest" so I should use the Search_Flights function with sort parameter as CHEAPEST. But wait, the required parameters are toId and fromId, which are airport IDs. I need to get those IDs first. The user provided city names, Philadelphia and Denver. So I should use Search_Flight_Location for both cities to get their airport IDs. Let me check the tools: there's a Search_Flight_Location endpoint that takes a query. So first, call Search_Flight_Location with "Philadelphia" to get the fromId, and "Denver" for toId. But wait, the user might be referring to the main airports. Maybe I should specify the airport names if possible, but the query parameter just takes location names. Let me proceed with the city names first.

Once I have the fromId and toId, then use Search_Flights with sort=CHEAPEST, adults=1 (assuming one adult), departDate=2024-12-20. Also, the user doesn't accept overnight layovers, so I need to check if the flight duration is within the same day. But the tool might not handle that directly. Maybe the API will return flights without layovers, but I need to ensure that. However, the parameters don't have an option for layover, so perhaps the user's requirement is to check the flight's duration. But since the tool doesn't have that parameter, I'll proceed with the cheapest option and assume that the API returns direct flights. If not, the user might need to filter manually, but I can't do that here. So proceed with the search.

Next, the hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver. The user wants a five-day stay. The Search_Hotels function requires dest_id, arrival_date, departure_date, and search_type. First, I need the dest_id for Denver. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query="Denver" to get the destination ID. Then, use Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival_date as 2024-12-20 (assuming arrival on the same day as flight), departure_date as 2024-12-25 (five days stay). The search_type would be the type retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. Also, the user wants the hotel near Downtown Aquarium, so maybe the search_type includes that location. Wait, the search_type parameter is retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. So first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Denver" to get the search_type and possibly the dest_id. Then use that search_type in Search_Hotels. But the user specified "near Downtown Aquarium", which might be a specific location. However, the Search_Hotels parameters don't have a location filter, only dest_id. So maybe the search_type includes the destination, and the hotel search will return options near that area. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the hotel to be near the aquarium, but the tool might not support that. So proceed with the destination ID and search_type from Denver.

Then, the taxi from the airport to the hotel one hour after landing. The user needs the taxi details. For that, I need the pick_up_place_id (airport) and drop_off_place_id (hotel). The airport's place_id can be obtained via Taxi_Search_Location with query="Philadelphia International Airport" (assuming the main airport in Philadelphia) and similarly for Denver. But the user might not specify the exact airport, so maybe use the city name. Wait, the Taxi_Search_Location endpoint takes a query, so for the airport, I can search for "Philadelphia International Airport" to get the place_id. Similarly for Denver's airport. Then, the hotel's place_id can be obtained from the hotel's details, but the user hasn't provided the hotel name yet. Wait, the user hasn't booked the hotel yet, so maybe the taxi needs to be from the airport to the hotel, but the hotel's place_id isn't known yet. Hmm, this is a problem. The taxi requires both pick_up and drop_off place_ids. Since the hotel isn't booked yet, perhaps the user expects the taxi to be booked after the hotel is selected. But the user's request is to book all three: flight, hotel, taxi. So maybe the taxi can be booked once the hotel's place_id is known. But the user might want the taxi to be arranged from the airport to the hotel, so the taxi's pick_up_place_id is the airport's place_id, and drop_off_place_id is the hotel's place_id. However, since the hotel isn't booked yet, perhaps the user expects the taxi to be booked with the hotel's details. But the tools don't allow for that. So maybe the taxi can be booked with the hotel's address once the hotel is selected. But the user hasn't provided the hotel name yet. Therefore, the process would be: first, get the flight, then the hotel, then the taxi. But the user wants all three booked. So the steps are:

1. Find the flight from Philadelphia to Denver on 2024-12-20, cheapest, no overnight layovers.
2. Find a hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver for 5 days (arrival on 2024-12-20, departure 2024-12-25).
3. Book a taxi from the airport (where the flight lands) to the hotel, one hour after landing.

But the taxi requires the hotel's place_id, which depends on the hotel's details. So the process would be:

- First, get the flight details (fromId and toId).
- Then, get the hotel's details (dest_id, arrival, departure dates) to get the hotel's place_id.
- Then, use the airport's place_id (from the flight's toId) and the hotel's place_id for the taxi.

But the user might not have the hotel's place_id yet. So the steps would be sequential. However, the user's request is to book all three, so the assistant needs to call the functions in order, possibly making multiple tool calls.

So first, call Search_Flight_Location for Philadelphia and Denver to get fromId and toId. Then, use those in Search_Flights. Then, get the hotel's dest_id via Search_Hotel_Destination for Denver, then Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival and departure dates. Then, get the hotel's place_id via Get_Attraction_Details? Wait, no. The hotel's place_id isn't directly available. The hotel's details might not be in the tools. The Get_Attraction_Details is for attractions, not hotels. So perhaps the hotel's place_id can't be retrieved, which complicates the taxi booking. Alternatively, maybe the hotel's address can be used to search for the place_id via Taxi_Search_Location. But the user hasn't provided the hotel name yet. So the process would be:

After booking the hotel, the user would need to get the hotel's address, then use Taxi_Search_Location to find the place_id. But the user hasn't provided the hotel name, so the assistant would need to first find the hotel, then get its address, then find the place_id. However, the tools don't have a way to get the hotel's address directly. The Search_Hotels might return the hotel's address, but the tool's parameters don't specify that. The Search_Hotels response might include the hotel's address, but the assistant can't see that. So the assistant would need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the hotel's place_id can be obtained via Taxi_Search_Location with the hotel's address. But since the user hasn't provided the hotel name, the assistant would need to first find the hotel, then get its address, then use that to find the place_id. However, the user's request is to book all three, so the assistant must proceed step by step.

So the steps are:

1. Search for flight from Philadelphia to Denver on 2024-12-20, cheapest.
   - Need fromId and toId, so first call Search_Flight_Location for Philadelphia and Denver.
2. Once flight is booked, get the arrival airport (Denver's airport) to get the pick_up_place_id for the taxi.
3. Search for hotel near Downtown Aquarium in Denver for 5 days.
   - Need dest_id for Denver, so call Search_Hotel_Destination for Denver.
   - Then call Search_Hotels with that dest_id, arrival and departure dates.
4. Once hotel is booked, get the hotel's address (assuming it's available) to find the drop_off_place_id via Taxi_Search_Location.
5. Book the taxi from the airport (toId from flight) to the hotel (drop_off_place_id from hotel's address) one hour after landing.

But the user's request is to book all three, so the assistant must make the necessary tool calls in order. However, the assistant can't know the hotel's address until it's booked. Therefore, the assistant would first handle the flight and hotel, then the taxi. But the user might not have provided the hotel's name, so the assistant would need to proceed with the available information.

So, the first step is to get the flight's fromId and toId. Then, the hotel's dest_id. Then, the taxi's pick_up_place_id (airport) and drop_off_place_id (hotel's address). But since the hotel's address isn't known
