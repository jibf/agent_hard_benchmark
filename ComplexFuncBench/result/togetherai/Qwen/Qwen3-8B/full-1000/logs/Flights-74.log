2025-08-15 01:24:08,277 - evaluation_logger_Flights-74 - INFO - Query: We're planning to leave Houston on December 1st, 2024, and travel to Rome. After staying in Rome for three days, we'll go to Oslo, then return to Houston on December 15th, 2024. I'm looking for the cheapest business class flights for this time period. If the ticket price is over 800 dollars, we won't stay in Rome. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo during this time.

Okay, let's break down the user's query step by step. The user is planning a trip starting from Houston on December 1st, 2024, going to Rome, staying for three days, then moving to Oslo, and returning to Houston on December 15th. They want the cheapest business class flights. However, if the Rome flights cost more than $800, they'll skip Rome and check direct round-trip flights from Houston to Oslo instead.

First, I need to figure out the flight segments. The trip has three parts: Houston to Rome, Rome to Oslo, and Oslo back to Houston. But the user's condition complicates things. If the Rome flights are too expensive, they'll adjust the plan. 

The user mentioned business class, so I should use the Get_Min_Price or Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops functions. However, the initial step is to check the availability and prices for each leg. 

First, I need to get the airport IDs for Houston, Rome, and Oslo. The Search_Flight_Location tool can help find these. For example, searching for "Houston" would give the fromId, and similarly for Rome and Oslo. 

Once I have the airport IDs, I can check the flight prices. The user wants the cheapest business class flights. The Get_Min_Price function is for direct flights, but since the trip involves multiple stops (Houston to Rome to Oslo to Houston), maybe Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops is needed. However, the user's initial plan is Houston to Rome, then Rome to Oslo, then Oslo to Houston. But if Rome is skipped, it's a direct flight from Houston to Oslo and back. 

Wait, the user's condition says if the Rome flights are over $800, they'll check direct flights from Houston to Oslo. So first, I need to check the price for the Rome leg. 

But the user's trip is a round trip with a stopover. So the first leg is Houston to Rome (departDate Dec 1), then Rome to Oslo (departDate Dec 4?), and then Oslo to Houston (returnDate Dec 15). But the return date is Dec 15, so the return flight from Oslo to Houston would need to be on or around that date. 

But the user's main concern is the cost. So first, check the price for the Houston to Rome flight (business class, Dec 1), then Rome to Oslo (business class, Dec 4?), and Oslo to Houston (business class, Dec 15). However, the user might be considering a multi-stop flight from Houston to Oslo via Rome, but if Rome is skipped, it's a direct flight. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is considering a round-trip from Houston to Rome to Oslo and back, but if that's too expensive, they'll take a direct flight from Houston to Oslo and back. 

But the user's initial plan is to go to Rome, stay three days, then Oslo, then return. So the flights would be:

1. Houston to Rome (Dec 1)
2. Rome to Oslo (Dec 4)
3. Oslo to Houston (Dec 15)

But the user wants the cheapest business class flights. However, if the total cost of these flights exceeds $800 (maybe per person?), they'll skip Rome and take a direct flight from Houston to Oslo and back. 

Wait, the user says "if the ticket price is over 800 dollars, we won't stay in Rome." So maybe the price for the Rome leg (Houston to Rome) is over $800, or the total for the entire trip? The wording is a bit unclear. But the user might mean that if the flight from Houston to Rome is over $800, they'll skip Rome. 

But the user's plan is to go to Rome, then Oslo, then return. So the first flight is Houston to Rome (Dec 1), then Rome to Oslo (Dec 4), then Oslo to Houston (Dec 15). The user wants the cheapest business class flights for these legs. However, if the price for the Rome leg (Houston to Rome) is over $800, they'll skip Rome and check direct flights from Houston to Oslo. 

But the user's message says "if the ticket price is over 800 dollars, we won't stay in Rome. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo during this time." So the condition is based on the price of the Rome leg. 

So first, I need to check the price of the Houston to Rome flight (business class, Dec 1). If that's over $800, then proceed to check the direct flight from Houston to Oslo. 

But how to check the price of the Houston to Rome flight? Using the Get_Min_Price function. The parameters required are fromId (Houston), toId (Rome), departDate (Dec 1), and cabinClass (BUSINESS). 

But to get the fromId and toId, I need to use the Search_Flight_Location tool. So first, search for Houston to get its airport ID, then search for Rome and Oslo to get their IDs. 

So the steps would be:

1. Search for Houston's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Houston".
2. Search for Rome's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Rome".
3. Search for Oslo's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location with query "Oslo".
4. Use Get_Min_Price to find the cheapest business class flight from Houston to Rome on Dec 1.
5. If the price is over $800, then check the direct flight from Houston to Oslo (return date Dec 15) using Get_Min_Price or Get_Min_Price_Multi_Stops. Wait, the user wants a direct round-trip, so maybe Get_Min_Price for Houston to Oslo and back? But the return date is Dec 15. 

Wait, the user's original plan is to leave Houston on Dec 1, stay in Rome for three days (so depart Rome on Dec 4), then go to Oslo, and return to Houston on Dec 15. So the return flight from Oslo to Houston would be on Dec 15. 

But if the user skips Rome, they want a direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo during the time period. The time period is Dec 1 to Dec 15. So the round-trip would be departing Houston on Dec 1 and returning on Dec 15. 

So, the first step is to check the price of the Houston to Rome flight (business class, Dec 1). If that's over $800, then check the direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo (business class, departing Dec 1, returning Dec 15). 

But the user might also need to check the Rome to Oslo flight and the Oslo to Houston flight. However, the initial condition is based on the price of the Rome leg. 

But the user's message is a bit ambiguous. It says "if the ticket price is over 800 dollars, we won't stay in Rome." So maybe the price of the entire trip (Houston to Rome to Oslo to Houston) is over $800, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, the user might be referring to the price of the Rome leg (Houston to Rome) being over $800. 

Assuming that, the first step is to check the price of the Houston to Rome flight. 

So, the first tool call would be to Search_Flight_Location for Houston, Rome, and Oslo to get their IDs. 

Then, use Get_Min_Price for Houston to Rome (Dec 1, business class). 

If the price is over $800, then check the direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo (Dec 1 to Dec 15, business class). 

But the user might also need to check the return flight from Oslo to Houston. However, the Get_Min_Price function for a round-trip would require departDate and returnDate. 

Wait, the Get_Min_Price function's parameters are departDate and returnDate. So for the direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo, the departDate is Dec 1, and returnDate is Dec 15. 

So, the steps are:

1. Search for Houston's airport ID.
2. Search for Rome's airport ID.
3. Search for Oslo's airport ID.
4. Check the price of Houston to Rome (business class, Dec 1) using Get_Min_Price.
5. If the price is over $800, check the direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo (business class, Dec 1 to Dec 15) using Get_Min_Price.
6. If the price is under $800, proceed to check the Rome to Oslo and Oslo to Houston flights. 

But the user's message says "instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Houston to Oslo during this time." So the main action is to check the direct flight if the Rome leg is over $800. 

But the user's initial request is to find the cheapest business class flights for the entire trip, considering the condition. 

So, the first thing is to get the airport IDs. Then, check the price for the Houston to Rome flight. 

Therefore, the first tool calls would be to Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

But the user might not have provided the exact airport codes, so the Search_Flight_Location tool is needed to find the IDs. 

So, the first three tool calls would be:

- Search_Flight_Location with query "Houston" to get fromId.
- Search_Flight_Location with query "Rome" to get toId for Rome.
- Search_Flight
