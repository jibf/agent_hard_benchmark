2025-08-15 01:01:28,217 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about the Stone Forest, and I first used the Search_Attraction_Location tool with "Stone Forest" as the query. That gave me a list of products, including a tour in Kunming. Then I called Get_Attraction_Details with the slug from that result. The response has a lot of details about the tour.

Now, I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants to know what the tour includes, any important terms, and maybe some tips. Let me check the data again. The description mentions UNESCO sites, the AAAAA classification, and activities like walking through limestone formations. The included items are a guide, hotel pickup, lunch, and a vehicle. Excluded are things like entrance fees and gratuities. There's a note about a negative review, so I should mention that there's a risk of cancellation. Also, the cancellation policy allows free cancellation. I should structure this into sections: overview, what's included, what's not, terms, and user review. Make sure to highlight key points like the UNESCO status, the tour highlights, and the cancellation policy. Avoid jargon and keep it conversational.
