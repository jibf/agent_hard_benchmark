Okay, let's tackle the user's request step by step. First, they want to book the cheapest flight from Beijing to London on December 5, 2024. Then, they need a taxi to pick them up two hours after landing and take them to the British Museum.

Starting with the flight booking. The user mentioned "cheapest," so the sort parameter should be "CHEAPEST." I need to find the airport IDs for Beijing and London. Using the Search_Flight_Location tool, I'll query both cities. For Beijing, the tool should return the airport ID, maybe Peking Airport (PEK) or Capital Airport (PKX). Similarly, for London, it's likely Heathrow (LHR), Gatwick (LGW), or Stansted (STN). Once I have the fromId (Beijing) and toId (London), I can call Search_Flights with departDate as 2024-12-05 and sort by CHEAPEST. Also, the user didn't specify the number of adults or children, so default to 1 adult. 

Next, the taxi service. The user needs a taxi from the airport to the British Museum. First, get the Google Place ID for the British Museum using Taxi_Search_Location with query "British Museum, London." Then, get the airport's Google Place ID from the flight's arrival airport. Wait, but the user hasn't specified which airport they're arriving at. Maybe the flight search will include the arrival airport's details. Alternatively, after getting the flight details, the toId (London airport) can be used to find the airport's location via Search_Flight_Location again? Or maybe the initial search for London's airport gives the place ID. Alternatively, maybe the taxi pickup is from the airport, so once the flight arrives, the taxi will pick up from there. But the user might need the taxi to pick up from the specific airport. However, the user hasn't specified which airport, so perhaps the flight booking will determine that. 

Wait, the user might not have specified the airport, so the flight search will return the cheapest flight, which might have a specific arrival airport. Once the flight is booked, the arrival airport's ID can be used to get the place ID for the taxi pickup. But the user wants the taxi to pick them up two hours after landing. So the taxi's pick-up time would be the flight's arrival time plus two hours. However, the flight's arrival time isn't known yet. So maybe the taxi search needs to be done after the flight is booked, but since the user is asking for both, perhaps the flight's arrival time can be estimated. Alternatively, the user might need to provide the flight's arrival time, but since they haven't, maybe the taxi can be scheduled for a specific time based on the flight's estimated arrival. 

But the user hasn't provided the flight's arrival time, so maybe the taxi's pick-up time is set to the flight's arrival time plus two hours. However, without knowing the flight's arrival time, this might not be possible. So perhaps the taxi search can be done once the flight details are known. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for flight locations for Beijing and London to get their airport IDs.
2. Search flights from Beijing to London on 2024-12-05, sorted by cheapest.
3. Once the flight is booked, get the arrival airport's details to find its place ID.
4. Search for the British Museum's place ID.
5. Use the taxi search tool with the airport's place ID as pick-up and British Museum as drop-off, with the pick-up time set to flight arrival time + 2 hours.

But since the user hasn't provided the flight's arrival time, maybe the taxi's pick-up time is based on the flight's departure time plus flight duration plus two hours. However, without knowing the flight duration, this is tricky. Alternatively, the user might need to provide the flight's arrival time, but since they haven't, perhaps the taxi can be scheduled for a specific time, but the user might need to input that. 

Alternatively, the user might not need the exact time, but the taxi can be arranged for a time after landing. However, the tool requires pick_up_time and pick_up_date. So perhaps the flight's arrival time is needed. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the flight search will return the arrival time, which can then be used to calculate the taxi's pick-up time. However, the current tools don't include a way to get flight arrival times. The Search_Flights tool might return flight details including arrival time, but the parameters for Search_Flights don't mention that. The parameters for Search_Flights include fromId, toId, departDate, sort, etc., but not arrival time. So perhaps the arrival time isn't available through the current tools. 

In that case, maybe the user needs to provide the pick-up time, but since they can't, perhaps the taxi can be scheduled for a specific date and time, but the user might have to estimate. However, the user's request is to have the taxi pick them up two hours after landing. So the taxi's pick-up time would be the flight's arrival time plus two hours. But without knowing the flight's arrival time, this is not possible. 

Wait, maybe the flight's arrival time can be inferred from the flight details. For example, if the flight departs Beijing on 2024-12-05, and the flight duration is, say, 12 hours, then arrival would be around 2024-12-06 at 00:00, so pick-up time would be 02:00 on 2024-12-06. But without knowing the flight duration, this is an assumption. 

Alternatively, the user might need to provide the flight's arrival time, but since they haven't, perhaps the taxi can be scheduled for a specific time, but the user might have to input that. However, the user hasn't provided that information. 

This seems like a problem. But given the tools available, perhaps the user is expected to provide the pick-up time, but since they can't, maybe the taxi can be scheduled for a specific date and time, but the user might have to estimate. 

Alternatively, maybe the flight's arrival time is not required, and the taxi can be booked for a specific date and time, but the user hasn't provided that. 

This is a bit of a dead end. However, the user's main request is to book the cheapest flight and then arrange a taxi. So the first step is to get the flight details, then use that to determine the taxi's pick-up time. 

So, first, call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and London to get their airport IDs. Then, call Search_Flights with fromId (Beijing airport ID), toId (London airport ID), departDate 2024-12-05, sort CHEAPEST. Once the flight is booked, the arrival airport's details (like arrival time) would be needed to calculate the taxi's pick-up time. However, the current tools don't provide arrival time. 

Alternatively, maybe the taxi's pick-up time can be set to the flight's departure date plus some estimated time. But this is not accurate. 

Given the constraints, perhaps the user is expected to provide the pick-up time, but since they can't, maybe the taxi can be scheduled for a specific date and time, but the user might have to input that. However, the user hasn't provided that. 

In this case, perhaps the assistant should proceed with the flight booking first, then the taxi booking, even if the taxi's pick-up time is not precise. 

So, first, call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and London to get their airport IDs. Then, call Search_Flights with the necessary parameters. Once the flight details are known, then proceed to get the taxi details. 

But the user hasn't provided the pick-up time, so the taxi's pick-up time would need to be estimated. However, the user might have to input that. 

Alternatively, the user might assume that the taxi can be arranged for the day of arrival, but the exact time is not specified. 

In any case, the first step is to get the flight details. So, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for Beijing and London to get their airport IDs. Then, call Search_Flights with those IDs and the departure date. 

So, the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location with query "Beijing" to get the fromId (Beijing airport ID). Then, Search_Flight_Location with query "London" to get the toId (London airport ID). Then, call Search_Flights with fromId, toId, departDate 2024-12-05, sort CHEAPEST. 

Once the flight is booked, the arrival airport's place ID can be used for the taxi's pick-up location. Then, search for the British Museum's place ID using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, call Search_Taxi with pick_up_place_id (airport's place ID), drop_off_place_id (British Museum's place ID), pick_up_date as the flight's arrival date, and pick_up_time as arrival time + 2 hours. 

But without knowing the flight's arrival time, this is not possible. However, the user might have to provide that, but they haven't. 

This is a problem. However, given the tools available, the assistant can proceed with the flight booking first, then the taxi booking, assuming that the user will provide the necessary details or that the flight's arrival time can be inferred. 

So, the first step is to get the
