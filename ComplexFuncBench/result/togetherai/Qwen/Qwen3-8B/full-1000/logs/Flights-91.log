Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user is planning a business trip from San Francisco to Singapore with a transfer in Amsterdam. They want the fastest premium economy class ticket and, if the fastest connecting flight departs before 10 am the next day, then check the fastest first class direct flight. Also, they need detailed flight info and seat maps.

First, I need to find the airports for San Francisco and Singapore. The user mentioned San Francisco, so I'll use Search_Flight_Location with "San Francisco" as the query. Similarly, for Singapore, I'll search for "Singapore" to get the airport ID. Wait, but the user mentioned transferring in Amsterdam, so maybe Amsterdam's airport is also needed. But the initial part is about the fastest route, so maybe the first step is to find the fastest flight from SF to Singapore via Amsterdam. But the user's first request is about the fastest premium economy ticket. 

Wait, the user's journey is San Francisco to Amsterdam (transfer) to Singapore. So the first leg is SF to Amsterdam, then Amsterdam to Singapore. But the user might be looking for a multi-stop flight. However, the second part says if the fastest connecting flight departs before 10 am next day, check a direct flight. So maybe the initial search is for a multi-stop flight (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore) in premium economy, then check if the fastest one departs before 10 am. If yes, then check a direct flight from SF to Singapore in first class.

But the user's first instruction is to check the price of the fastest premium economy ticket for the journey (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore). So first, I need to get the airport IDs for San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore. Let me start by searching for San Francisco's airport ID using Search_Flight_Location. Then Amsterdam and Singapore.

Once I have the fromId (San Francisco) and toId (Singapore), but wait, the multi-stop flight requires legs. So the first step is to get the airport IDs for each city. Then, use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with legs: SF to Amsterdam, then Amsterdam to Singapore. But the user might not have specified the exact airports, so I need to search for the locations first.

Wait, the user might be referring to the main airports. For example, San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS), and Singapore Changi (SIN). So I need to get the IDs for these airports. Let me start by calling Search_Flight_Location for each city.

First, search for San Francisco to get its airport ID. Then Amsterdam, then Singapore. Once I have those IDs, I can proceed to search for multi-stop flights. But the user's first part is about the fastest premium economy ticket. So the first step is to find the fastest multi-stop flight (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore) in premium economy. Then check if the departure time is before 10 am the next day. If so, then check the direct flight from SF to Singapore in first class.

But the user's query is a bit complex. Let me break it down:

1. Check the price of the fastest premium economy class ticket for the journey (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore). 
2. If the fastest connecting flight departs before 10 am the next day, then check the price of the fastest first class direct flight from SF to Singapore.
3. Provide detailed flight info and seat map.

So first, I need to get the airport IDs for San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore. Let's start with that.

First, call Search_Flight_Location for "San Francisco" to get the fromId. Then for "Amsterdam" to get the toId for the first leg, and "Singapore" for the second leg. Wait, but the multi-stop flight requires the toId of the first leg to be the fromId of the second leg. So the first leg is SF to Amsterdam, then Amsterdam to Singapore. So I need the airport IDs for each city.

Once I have those, I can use Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. The parameters would include adults, cabinClass (premium economy), sort by FASTEST, and the legs array with the fromId and toId for each leg, along with the dates. The departDate for the first leg is November 25, 2024. The returnDate might not be needed here since it's a multi-stop, but the user's journey is from SF to Singapore with a transfer in Amsterdam. Wait, the user's initial departure is November 25, 2024, and the transfer in Amsterdam. So the first leg is SF to Amsterdam on November 25, then Amsterdam to Singapore on the same day or next day. But the user's second part says if the fastest connecting flight takes off before 10 am the next day (November 26), then check the direct flight. So the first leg's date is November 25, and the second leg's date would be November 25 or 26, depending on the flight.

But the user's initial request is to check the fastest premium economy ticket for the journey (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore). So the first step is to search for multi-stop flights with legs SF to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to Singapore. The departDate for the first leg is November 25, 2024. The second leg's date would be the same day or the next day. The user wants the fastest flight, so sort by FASTEST.

Once I get the fastest premium economy flight, I need to check if the departure time of the connecting flight (from Amsterdam to Singapore) is before 10 am on November 26. If so, then proceed to check the direct flight from SF to Singapore in first class.

So the steps are:

1. Get airport IDs for San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.
2. Search for multi-stop flights (SF to Amsterdam to Singapore) in premium economy, sorted by fastest.
3. Check the departure time of the connecting flight (Amsterdam to Singapore) to see if it's before 10 am on November 26.
4. If yes, search for direct flights from SF to Singapore in first class, sorted by fastest.
5. For both cases, get detailed flight info and seat maps.

But the user's query is a bit ambiguous. The first part is about the fastest premium economy ticket for the journey (which includes the transfer in Amsterdam), and the second part is a conditional check based on the departure time of the connecting flight. So the first step is to find the fastest multi-stop flight in premium economy, then check the departure time. If it meets the condition, then check the direct flight in first class.

So first, I need to call Search_Flight_Location for each city to get their airport IDs. Let's start with San Francisco.

Call Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get the fromId for the first leg. Then call Search_Flight_Location for "Amsterdam" to get the toId for the first leg (Amsterdam's airport ID), and "Singapore" for the second leg's toId.

Once I have those IDs, I can proceed to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops with the legs array. The legs would be:

[
  { "fromId": SF_id, "toId": Amsterdam_id, "date": "2024-11-25" },
  { "fromId": Amsterdam_id, "toId": Singapore_id, "date": "2024-11-25" }
]

But the second leg's date might be the same day or the next day. However, the user's initial departure is November 25, so the first leg is on that day. The second leg's date would depend on the flight's schedule. The user wants the fastest flight, so the system will handle that.

Once the multi-stop flights are found, the fastest one's departure time from Amsterdam to Singapore needs to be checked. If it departs before 10 am on November 26, then proceed to check the direct flight.

So the first tool calls are Search_Flight_Location for each city. Then, Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the multi-stop journey. Then, if needed, Search_Flights for the direct flight. Then, Get_Flight_Details for the token, and Get_Seat_Map for the offerToken.

But the user also wants detailed flight information and seat maps. So after getting the flight details, we need to call Get_Flight_Details with the token, and Get_Seat_Map with the offerToken.

But the user's query is a bit complex, so I need to structure the tool calls step by step. Let's start with the first part: getting the airport IDs.

First, call Search_Flight_Location for San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore. Then use those IDs in the multi-stop search. Then check the departure time. If it meets the condition, proceed to search for the direct flight in first class. Then get the details and seat map for both scenarios.

So the first tool call is Search_Flight_Location for "San Francisco" to get the fromId. Then for "Amsterdam" to get the toId for the first leg, and "Singapore" for the second leg's toId.

Wait, but the multi-stop flight requires the legs to be in an array. So the first leg is from SF to Amsterdam, and the second leg is from Amsterdam to Singapore. So the fromId for the first leg is SF's airport ID, toId is Amsterdam's airport ID. The second leg's fromId is Amsterdam's airport ID, toId is Singapore's airport ID. The dates for the legs would be the same day (November 25) unless the first leg's arrival is late, but the user's
