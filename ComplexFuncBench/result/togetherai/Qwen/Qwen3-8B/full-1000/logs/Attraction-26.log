Okay, the user asked about the Forbidden City, and I used the tools to get detailed information. Let me break down the data from the tool response to provide a clear answer.

First, the attraction details: the Forbidden City ticket is operated by Authentic China Tours. The price is $9.90 USD, and it's bookable with free cancellation. The description mentions pre-booking to save time, entering by passport, and exploring at your own pace. 

The additional info highlights that it's not wheelchair accessible, requires physical fitness, and travelers need to bring their ticket. There are some restrictions for certain health conditions. The cancellation policy allows free cancellation, which is good. 

Reviews are mostly positive, with high ratings. Users like the convenience of pre-booking and the ability to visit at their own time. Some mentions of the audio guide being a bit tricky, but overall, it's a positive experience. 

I should structure the answer to cover key points: what's included, restrictions, cancellation policy, and the positive reviews. Make sure to mention the need for a passport and the importance of bringing the ticket. Also, note the accessibility issues and health recommendations. Keep it concise but informative.
