2025-08-15 00:27:53,613 - evaluation_logger_Cross-391 - INFO - Query: It's 10 o'clock in the morning on December 10, 2024. I just had breakfast at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. All local flights in San Francisco have been canceled due to heavy rain. I need to catch a taxi to an airport in a nearby city to fly to Chicago right away. Could you find a taxi for me and check the corresponding flight information?

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They're in San Francisco, had breakfast at the Hilton near Union Square, and all local flights are canceled due to heavy rain. They need a taxi to a nearby city's airport to catch a flight to Chicago. The user wants me to find a taxi and check flight info.

First, I need to figure out the steps. The user is currently at the hotel, so the pickup location is the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. The taxi needs to take them to an airport in a nearby city. But which nearby city? The user mentioned "nearby city," so maybe cities like Oakland, San Jose, or maybe even Sacramento? Wait, but they need to fly to Chicago. Wait, the user is leaving San Francisco, but all local flights are canceled. So they need to take a taxi to another airport that's not in San Francisco but in a nearby city, then take a flight to Chicago. Wait, but the user might be confused. Wait, the user is in San Francisco, and all local flights (from SF) are canceled. So they need to go to another airport in a nearby city (like Oakland, which has an airport) and then take a flight to Chicago. So the taxi is from their hotel to Oakland International Airport, for example.

So first, I need to get the Google Place ID for the pickup location (Hilton San Francisco Union Square) to use in the taxi search. Then, find nearby cities' airports. Wait, but the user might not know which nearby city's airport to go to. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to find nearby cities to San Francisco that have airports, then check flights from those airports to Chicago. But the user's main request is to find a taxi to an airport in a nearby city and check the corresponding flight info. So the steps would be:

1. Find the Google Place ID for the Hilton San Francisco Union Square (pickup location) using Taxi_Search_Location.
2. Find nearby cities to San Francisco that have airports. Wait, but the user might not know the exact city. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for nearby airports in the Bay Area. So perhaps first, get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton to find nearby cities with airports. But the user might not need that. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to go to the nearest airport, like Oakland International Airport. But the user might not know that. So maybe first, get the location details of the Hilton to find nearby airports. Wait, but the user is asking for a taxi to an airport in a nearby city. So perhaps the first step is to get the Google Place ID for the pickup location (Hilton) to use in the taxi search. Then, the taxi will take them to an airport. But which airport? The user might need to know which nearby airports are available. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for nearby cities with airports, then check flights from those airports to Chicago. But the user's main request is to find a taxi and check flight info. So perhaps the steps are:

First, get the Google Place ID for the pickup location (Hilton) using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, use that to find taxi options. But the user also needs to check flight info from the nearby airport to Chicago. So after getting the taxi info, the next step would be to find the airport's ID (using Search_Flight_Location) and then search for flights from that airport to Chicago. But the user hasn't specified which nearby city's airport, so maybe the assistant needs to first find nearby cities with airports. Wait, but the user might not know which city's airport to go to. So perhaps the assistant should first find nearby cities to San Francisco that have airports. To do that, maybe get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton, then use Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities, then check which of those cities have airports. But the user might not have provided that info. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can directly search for airports near San Francisco using Search_Flight_Location with the query "San Francisco" to get possible airports, then check which ones are operational. But the user mentioned that all local flights are canceled, so maybe the user needs to go to a different airport. Wait, but the user is in San Francisco, and all local flights are canceled. So they need to take a taxi to another airport in a nearby city (like Oakland, which has an airport) and then take a flight to Chicago. So the steps would be:

1. Get the Google Place ID for the Hilton San Francisco Union Square using Taxi_Search_Location.
2. Use that Google Place ID to search for taxi options to nearby airports. But the user might need to specify the destination airport. Alternatively, the assistant might need to first find nearby airports in the area. So perhaps first, use Search_Flight_Location with query "San Francisco" to get possible airports, but since all local flights are canceled, maybe the user needs to go to a different airport. Wait, but the user is in San Francisco and needs to go to an airport in a nearby city. So maybe the assistant should first find nearby cities with airports. To do that, get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton, then use Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities, then check which of those cities have airports. But the user might not have provided that info. Alternatively, the assistant can directly search for airports in nearby cities. But the user hasn't specified which city, so maybe the assistant needs to first find nearby cities with airports. However, the user's main request is to find a taxi and check flight info. So perhaps the assistant should first find the taxi options from the Hilton to an airport (like Oakland International Airport), then check flights from that airport to Chicago. But the user might not know which airport to go to. So the assistant might need to first find nearby airports. Let me outline the steps again:

1. Find the Google Place ID for the pickup location (Hilton San Francisco Union Square) using Taxi_Search_Location.
2. Use that Google Place ID to search for taxi options to nearby airports. But the user might need to specify the destination airport. Alternatively, the assistant can use the location of the Hilton to find nearby airports. So perhaps first, get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton using Location_to_Lat_Long. Then, use Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities, then check which of those cities have airports. But the user might not have provided that info. Alternatively, the assistant can directly search for airports in the area using Search_Flight_Location with the query "San Francisco" to get possible airports, but since all local flights are canceled, maybe the user needs to go to a different airport. Wait, but the user is in San Francisco and needs to go to an airport in a nearby city. So perhaps the assistant should first find nearby cities with airports. Let me think: the user is at the Hilton in San Francisco. The nearby cities with airports could be Oakland (OAK), San Jose (SJC), or maybe even Sacramento (SMF). So the assistant might need to find the nearest airports. But how? The user hasn't specified which one, so the assistant might need to find the nearest airports. So first, get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton using Location_to_Lat_Long. Then, use Get_Nearby_Cities to find nearby cities, then check which of those cities have airports. But the user might not have provided that info. Alternatively, the assistant can directly search for airports in the area using Search_Flight_Location with the query "nearby airports in San Francisco" or similar. But the Search_Flight_Location tool is for finding airports by location, address, etc. So maybe the assistant can use Search_Flight_Location with the query "San Francisco" to get a list of airports in the area. Then, check which of those airports are operational (but the user says all local flights are canceled, so maybe the user needs to go to a different airport). Wait, but the user is in San Francisco and needs to go to an airport in a nearby city. So perhaps the assistant should first find the nearest airports to San Francisco. Let me proceed step by step.

First, the user is at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. So the pickup location is that hotel. The first step is to get the Google Place ID for that location using Taxi_Search_Location. Then, the taxi will take them to an airport. But which airport? The user needs to go to an airport in a nearby city. So the assistant might need to find nearby cities with airports. To do that, perhaps first get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton using Location_to_Lat_Long. Then, use Get_Nearby_Cities with those coordinates to find nearby cities. Then, for each of those cities, check if they have an airport. But the user might not have provided that info. Alternatively, the assistant can directly search for airports in the area using Search_Flight_Location with the query "nearby airports in San Francisco" or similar. But the Search_Flight_Location tool's description says it can find airports by location, address, state, country, etc. So maybe the assistant can use Search_Flight_Location with the query "San Francisco" to get a list of airports in the area. Then, the user can choose one. But the user might not know which one. Alternatively, the assistant can use the location of the Hilton to find nearby airports. Let me proceed with the steps:

1. Use Taxi_Search_Location to get the Google Place ID for the Hilton San Francisco Union Square.
2. Use Location_to_Lat_Long to get the latitude and longitude of the Hilton.
3. Use Get_Nearby_Cities with the latitude and longitude to find nearby cities.
4. For each nearby city, use Search_Flight_Location to find airports in those cities.
5. Once the airports are found, use Search_Flights to check flight info
