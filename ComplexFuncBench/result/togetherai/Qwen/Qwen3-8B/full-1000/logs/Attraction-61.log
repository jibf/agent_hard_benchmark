Okay, let's see. The user is looking for Opera-themed attractions in Rome under $100. The first one they checked was "Opera Serenades in Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome" which cost $103.95. That's over 100, so they need the next option.

The second attraction they checked is "Opera Concert Ticket in Rome with Dinner" priced at $86.62. That's under $100. Now, I should check if this meets all the user's criteria. The price is good, but I should look at the reviews. The review mentions a 3-star rating, with some complaints about the venue and difficulty finding the restaurant. However, the user didn't specify needing perfect reviews, just the price. 

Since the price is under 100 and it's Opera-themed, this seems to fit. The user might be okay with the review comments, especially since the dinner part is included. I should present this as the valid option. No need to check further since the first under-100 option is found. Also, the cancellation policy is free, which is a plus. So the answer should confirm this as the suitable choice.
