Okay, the user wants to know the reviews for the Four Points by Sheraton Winnipeg South hotel. Let me figure out how to get that information.

First, I need to check if there's a function that can retrieve hotel reviews. Looking at the tools provided, there's the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function. It requires a hotel_id and optionally a sort_option_id. 

But wait, the user hasn't provided the hotel_id yet. The hotel name is given, but the function needs the hotel_id, which can be obtained from either the Search_Hotels or Search_HotelsByCoordinates endpoints. However, the user hasn't mentioned needing to search for the hotel; they already know the name and dates. 

Wait, maybe the user expects me to know the hotel_id. But since the tools don't include a function to search by hotel name directly, I might need to first find the hotel_id using another method. However, the available functions are Search_Hotels, Search_Hotel_Destination, Get_Attraction_Details, and Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips-. 

The Search_Hotels function requires parameters like search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, etc. But the user hasn't provided the destination ID. Alternatively, maybe the user can be asked for the destination ID or the hotel's coordinates. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps I need to first find the hotel's ID using the Search_Hotels function. 

Wait, but the user already knows the hotel name. Maybe the Search_Hotels function can be used with the hotel name as part of the search_type? Wait, no. The search_type parameter in Search_Hotels is retrieved from the Search_Hotel_Destination endpoint, which is used to find destinations. The search_type might be a category like 'city' or 'region', not the hotel name. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first find the destination ID for Winnipeg South using Search_Hotel_Destination. Let me check. The Search_Hotel_Destination function takes a query parameter, which can be a location name. So, if I call Search_Hotel_Destination with "Winnipeg South", I might get the dest_id. Then, using that dest_id, along with the arrival and departure dates, I can call Search_Hotels to find the hotel_id. 

But the user already knows the hotel name, so maybe the Search_Hotels function can be used with the hotel name as part of the search. Wait, the Search_Hotels function's parameters include search_type, which is retrieved from Search_Hotel_Destination. The search_type could be something like 'hotel_name', but I'm not sure. The description says that search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first get the destination ID for Winnipeg South. Let me proceed step by step. 

First, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in the Search_Hotels function along with the arrival and departure dates to find the hotel. Once the hotel is found, extract the hotel_id from the response. Then, use that hotel_id in the Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- function to retrieve the reviews. 

But the user hasn't provided the destination ID, so I need to first find it. However, the user might not know the exact destination ID, so this seems necessary. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can provide the hotel's coordinates, but they haven't. So, the process would be:

1. Use Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id.
2. Use Search_Hotels with search_type (from the previous step?), arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date to find the hotel.
3. From the Search_Hotels response, get the hotel_id for Four Points by Sheraton Winnipeg South.
4. Then call Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- with that hotel_id to get the reviews.

But the user hasn't provided the search_type for the Search_Hotels function. Wait, the search_type parameter is retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So, after getting the dest_id, maybe the search_type is determined based on that. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is a parameter that can be set to 'hotel_name' or similar. But the tools don't specify that. The description says that search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So, perhaps the Search Hotel Destination endpoint returns possible search types, like 'city', 'region', etc. 

This is getting complicated. Since the user has already specified the hotel name and dates, maybe the best approach is to first find the destination ID for Winnipeg South using Search_Hotel_Destination, then use that to find the hotel_id via Search_Hotels, and then get the reviews. 

So, first step: call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the arrival and departure dates to find the hotel. Once the hotel is found, extract the hotel_id. Then, use that hotel_id in Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- to get the reviews. 

But the user hasn't provided the search_type for Search_Hotels. Wait, the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So, the search_type must be determined. How? The search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. 

Wait, the description for the Search_Hotels function says that search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So, perhaps after getting the dest_id from Search_Hotel_Destination, the search_type is determined based on that. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is a parameter that can be set to 'hotel_name' or similar. But without more information, it's hard to say. 

Given the user's query, the immediate step is to get the hotel_id. Since the user knows the hotel name, maybe the Search_Hotels function can be used with the hotel name as part of the search. However, the parameters for Search_Hotels don't include a hotel name. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe the user needs to first find the destination ID, then use that to search for hotels, and then get the hotel_id. 

So, first, call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the arrival and departure dates to find the hotel. Once the hotel is found, extract the hotel_id. Then, use that hotel_id in Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- to get the reviews. 

But the user hasn't provided the search_type for Search_Hotels. Wait, the required parameters for Search_Hotels are search_type, arrival_date, dest_id, departure_date. So, the search_type must be determined. How? The search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. 

Wait, the description for the Search_Hotels function says that search_type can be retrieved from the Search Hotel Destination endpoint. So, perhaps after getting the dest_id, the search_type is determined based on that. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is a parameter that can be set to 'hotel_name' or similar. But without knowing the exact options, it's hard to proceed. 

Given the user's query, perhaps the best approach is to first call Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the arrival and departure dates, and possibly a search_type that's appropriate. 

But since the user has already specified the hotel name, maybe the search_type is 'hotel_name' or similar. However, without knowing the exact options, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the search_type is not needed if the dest_id is known. But the required parameters for Search_Hotels include search_type, so it's necessary. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the user expects that the hotel_id is known, but since it's not provided, I need to find it. 

In conclusion, the steps would be:

1. Call Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id.
2. Use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the arrival and departure dates, and a search_type (maybe 'city' or similar) to find the hotel.
3. From the Search_Hotels response, get the hotel_id for Four Points by Sheraton Winnipeg South.
4. Use that hotel_id in Get_Hotel_Reviews-Tips- to retrieve the reviews.

But since the user hasn't provided the search_type, I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the search_type is not required if the dest_id is known. But according to the function parameters, it's required. 

This is a bit of a problem. Without knowing the search_type, I can't proceed. However, the user might have provided enough information to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can be asked for the destination ID, but since the user hasn't provided it, I need to proceed with the available information. 

In this case, the first step is to call Search_Hotel_Destination with the query "Winnipeg South" to get the dest_id. Then, use that dest_id in Search_Hotels with the arrival and departure dates, and a search_type that's appropriate. 

So, the first tool call would be Search_Hotel_Destination with query "Winnipeg South".
