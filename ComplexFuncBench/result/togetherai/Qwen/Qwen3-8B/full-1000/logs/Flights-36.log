Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to travel from Vancouver to Calgary and Edmonton, staying a week in each, then return to Vancouver on December 19th. They need business class flights with detailed info and seat maps.

First, I need to figure out the flight legs. The journey has two legs: Vancouver to Calgary and Edmonton, then return. Wait, actually, the user mentioned leaving Vancouver on Dec 5th, going to Calgary and Edmonton, then returning on Dec 19th. So maybe the outbound is Vancouver to Calgary and Edmonton, but how? Wait, maybe they're going to Calgary first, then Edmonton, then back. Or maybe they have a multi-stop flight from Vancouver to both cities? Hmm, the user might need multi-stop flights for the outbound trip. Let me check the tools available.

The Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool allows searching for multi-stop flights. The legs parameter is an array of objects with fromId, toId, and date. So for the outbound trip, the first leg is Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th? Or maybe the user is staying in each city for a week, so the outbound trip is Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th, and then Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. Wait, the return is on Dec 19th, so the return trip would be Edmonton to Vancouver on that date. But the user might need to have flights that cover all the stops. 

Wait, the user's plan is to leave Vancouver on Dec 5th, travel to Calgary and Edmonton, then return on Dec 19th. So the outbound journey would be Vancouver to Calgary, then Calgary to Edmonton. Then the return would be Edmonton to Vancouver. So for the outbound, two legs: Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th (assuming they stay a week in each, but maybe the dates need to be adjusted). Wait, the user says they'll stay in each city for a week. So if they leave Vancouver on Dec 5th, they might arrive in Calgary on Dec 5th, stay until Dec 12th, then go to Edmonton on Dec 12th, stay until Dec 19th, then return. But the return is on Dec 19th, so the return flight would be from Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. 

But the user might need to have flights that cover all these stops. So for the outbound, the first leg is Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 12th (assuming they stay a week in Calgary). Then the return leg is Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. Wait, but the user might need to have a multi-stop flight from Vancouver to both Calgary and Edmonton in one trip. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool allows multiple legs. So the outbound trip would have two legs: Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th (if they want to stay a week in each, maybe the dates need to be adjusted). Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a flight that goes from Vancouver to Calgary and Edmonton in one trip, but that's not typical. Usually, you'd have separate flights. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a multi-stop flight that goes from Vancouver to Calgary, then to Edmonton, then back. But the return trip would be Edmonton to Vancouver. So the outbound legs are Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th. The return leg is Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. 

So for the outbound, the legs array would have two entries: first leg from Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, second leg from Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th. Then the return leg is Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. 

But the user might need to check for multi-stop flights for the outbound and return. So first, I need to use the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool for the outbound trip. The parameters would be adults, legs, cabinClass, sort. The legs array would have two legs: Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th, then Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 6th. Then, for the return trip, another multi-stop flight from Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th. 

Wait, but the user might need to have separate flights for each leg. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a round-trip with multiple stops. But the Search_Flights_Multi_Stops tool is for multi-stop flights, so perhaps the outbound is two legs, and the return is one leg. 

So first, I need to call Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound trip. The legs would be:

Leg 1: fromId (Vancouver's airport ID), toId (Calgary's airport ID), date Dec 5th.

Leg 2: fromId (Calgary's airport ID), toId (Edmonton's airport ID), date Dec 6th (assuming they stay a week in Calgary, but maybe the dates need to be adjusted based on the user's stay duration. Wait, the user says they'll stay in each city for a week. So if they leave Vancouver on Dec 5th, arrive in Calgary on Dec 5th, stay until Dec 12th (a week), then leave Calgary on Dec 12th for Edmonton, stay until Dec 19th, then return. So the legs would be:

Outbound:

Leg 1: Vancouver to Calgary on Dec 5th.

Leg 2: Calgary to Edmonton on Dec 12th.

Return:

Leg 1: Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th.

But the user might need to have the return flight on Dec 19th. So the return trip is a single leg. 

So for the outbound, the multi-stop flight would have two legs. Then, the return is a single leg. 

But the user might need to find the best business class flights for the entire journey. So first, I need to get the flight details for the outbound multi-stop and the return flight. 

But the user's initial request is to find the best business class flights for the journey, so the first step is to search for multi-stop flights for the outbound trip. 

So the parameters for Search_Flights_Multi_Stops would be:

adults: 1 (assuming the user is one adult, but the user might have more people, but the query doesn't specify. Wait, the user says "our company", so maybe multiple adults, but the query doesn't specify. The default is 1, but maybe the user needs to adjust. However, the user hasn't provided the number of adults, so perhaps we should use the default of 1 unless specified. But the user might need to clarify, but since the query is as given, we'll proceed with the default. 

cabinClass: BUSINESS.

sort: BEST, CHEAPEST, or FASTEST. The user wants the best, so maybe sort by BEST.

legs: array of two legs for outbound. 

But first, we need the fromId and toId for Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton. These can be obtained via the Search_Flight_Location tool. 

So first, the user needs to find the airport IDs for Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton. 

So the first step is to call Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

For Vancouver, query "Vancouver". 

For Calgary, query "Calgary". 

For Edmonton, query "Edmonton". 

Once we have the airport IDs, we can proceed to search for the multi-stop flights. 

But the user's query is to find the best business class flights, so the steps would be:

1. Find airport IDs for Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton using Search_Flight_Location.

2. Use those IDs to search for multi-stop flights for the outbound trip (Vancouver to Calgary to Edmonton) on the specified dates.

3. Then, search for return flights from Edmonton to Vancouver on Dec 19th.

4. Once the flight details are obtained, get the seat maps using Get_Seat_Map for each flight.

But the user also wants detailed flight information, including baggage allowances, etc., so after getting the flight tokens from the search, we need to call Get_Flight_Details for each flight. 

So the process would involve multiple steps. 

But since the user is asking for the best business class flights, the first step is to find the multi-stop flights for the outbound and return. 

But the user's initial request is to find the best business class flights for the entire journey, so the first tool to use is Search_Flights_Multi_Stops for the outbound trip. However, to get the fromId and toId, we need to first find the airport IDs. 

Therefore, the first tool calls would be to Search_Flight_Location for each city. 

So, the assistant should first call Search_Flight_Location for Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton to get their airport IDs. 

Once those are obtained, then proceed to search for the multi-stop flights. 

But the user's message doesn't specify the exact dates for each leg. The outbound starts on Dec 5th, and the return is on Dec 19th. So the first leg (Vancouver to Calgary) is on Dec 5th, the second leg (Calgary to Edmonton) would be on Dec 12th (assuming a week in Calgary), and the return leg (Edmonton to Vancouver) on Dec 19th. 

But the user might need to adjust the dates based on the flight availability. 

So the steps are:

1. Search for
