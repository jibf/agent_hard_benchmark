Okay, let's see. The user asked for attractions near Pudong Shangri-La Hotel in Shanghai and detailed descriptions. The first step was to use the Get_Popular_Attraction_Near_By tool with the hotel_id 181422. That gave the Oriental Pearl Tower as the closest landmark. Then, I needed to get more details about that attraction.

So, I called Search_Attraction_Location with "Oriental Pearl Tower" to find the slug, which is needed for the Get_Attraction_Details tool. The response provided the product slug. Using that slug, I fetched the detailed information about the attraction. The data includes the description, opening hours, ticket info, and other details. Now, I need to present this information in a user-friendly way, highlighting the key points like what's included, opening hours, pricing, and any important notes. Also, since the user might be planning a visit, mentioning the ticket booking process and cancellation policy would be helpful. I should structure the answer clearly, starting with the attraction name, location, then key features, what's included, and practical info like hours and pricing. Make sure to keep it concise but informative.
