2025-08-14 02:38:37,348 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Miami for a two-day business trip on December 10, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Boston directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 02:38:45,605 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Final Response: To find the best multi-stop flights for your trip, I need a bit more information:

1. Which city will you visit for your four-day vacation after Miami? If you’re not sure, I can suggest some popular nearby destinations.
2. How many travelers are in your group, and do you have a preferred cabin class (Economy, Business, etc.)?

Once you provide these details, I’ll search for the best flight options for your itinerary:

- Boston → Miami (Dec 10, 2024)
- Miami → [Vacation City] (Dec 12, 2024)
- [Vacation City] → Boston (Dec 16, 2024)

Let me know your preferences!
