2025-08-14 02:38:25,748 - evaluation_logger_Cross-205 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Chicago for a two-day business trip on December 1, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to New York directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 02:38:35,389 - evaluation_logger_Cross-205 - INFO - Final Response: To find the best multi-stop flights for your trip, I need a bit more information:

1. Which airport in New York will you depart from (e.g., JFK, LGA, EWR)?
2. Do you have a specific nearby city in mind for your vacation after Chicago, or would you like suggestions?
3. What is your preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?
4. Will you be traveling alone, or are there additional passengers (adults/children)?

Once I have these details, I can search for the best multi-stop flight options for you!
