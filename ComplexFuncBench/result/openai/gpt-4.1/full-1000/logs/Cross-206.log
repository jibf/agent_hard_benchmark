2025-08-14 02:38:28,115 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Milan for a four-day business trip on December 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Prague directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 02:38:35,835 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Final Response: To find the best multi-stop flights for your trip, I need a bit more information:

1. What city will you be flying from to Milan?
2. Do you have a preferred nearby city to visit after Milan, or would you like suggestions?
3. Are your travel dates fixed, or do you have some flexibility for the vacation portion?
4. How many travelers (adults/children) will be on this trip?
5. Do you have a preferred cabin class (Economy, Business, etc.)?

Once I have these details, I can search for the most suitable flights for you!
