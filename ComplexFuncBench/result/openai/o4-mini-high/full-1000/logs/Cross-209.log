2025-08-14 10:31:41,183 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Vienna for a five-day business trip on November 30, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Hamburg directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:56,760 - evaluation_logger_Cross-209 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—happy to help! To find the best multi-stop itinerary, I just need a bit more information:

1. Which nearby city would you like to visit for your five-day leisure stay after Vienna?  
2. Will it just be you traveling?  
3. Do you have a preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First)?

Once I have that, I can pull flight options from Hamburg → Vienna (Nov 30), Vienna → [Your chosen city] (Dec 5), and then back to Hamburg (Dec 10).
