2025-08-14 10:30:53,350 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to London for a three-day business trip on November 18, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Berlin directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:12,473 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—could you let me know which nearby city you’d like to visit after London for those two days? Once I have that (and any preference for cabin class), I can pull up multi-stop flight options fitting your schedule.
