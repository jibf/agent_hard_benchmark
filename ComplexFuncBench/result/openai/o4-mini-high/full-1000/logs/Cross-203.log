2025-08-14 10:31:06,423 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Orlando for a three-day business trip on October 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Toronto directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:20,086 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—let’s plan that multi‐stop itinerary. You’ll fly  
• Leg 1: Toronto → Orlando on 2024-10-20  
• Leg 2: Orlando → [your choice of nearby city] about 2024-10-23  
• Leg 3: That city → Toronto about 2024-10-27  

Which nearby city would you like to visit after Orlando? (For example, Tampa, Miami, Jacksonville, Key West, etc.) Once you pick your destination, I’ll pull the flight options.
