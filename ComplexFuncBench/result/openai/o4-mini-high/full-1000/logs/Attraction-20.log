2025-08-14 11:07:32,777 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-20 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s a closer look at the “Stone Forest” (Shilin) experience near Kunming, Yunnan:

1. What & Where  
 • Officially called the Naigu Stone Forest (part of the larger Stone Forest Scenic Area), it’s a karst limestone landscape of towering pillars, spires and “stone forests.”  • A UNESCO World Heritage site (AAAAA-class scenic area), yet far less crowded than the Major/Minor Stone Forest sections.  
 • Located roughly 90 km southeast of Kunming city center.

2. Highlights of a Typical Day Tour  
 • Visit Naigu Stone Forest, trek up to a panoramic vantage point and wander the maze of stone-paved trails.  
 • Stop at Suogeyi (“Sani”) Village—an indigenous Yi community within the same heritage zone.  
 • Enjoy a local Yi-style lunch in a village restaurant.  

3. What’s Included  
 • English-speaking guide  
 • Private, air-conditioned vehicle with hotel pick-up/drop-off in Kunming  
 • Lunch (Yi restaurant)  
 • All ground transport and driver fees  

4. Not Included (pay on site)  
 • Naigu Stone Forest entrance fee (≈ 60 RMB per person)  
 • Gratuities   
 • Tolls (≈ 65 RMB one-way for a 5–7 seat car)   
 • Fuel surcharge (≈ 100–150 RMB per vehicle)  
 • Additional food/drinks beyond lunch  

5. Logistics & Booking  
 • Duration: ~ 8–10 hours (depart Kunming early AM, return late afternoon)  
 • Group size: Min. 2, max. 9 people   
 • Price (approx.): USD 105.55 per person   
 • Free cancellation up to 24 hours before tour date   
 • Wheelchair accessible; suitable for all fitness levels  

6. Tips for Your Visit  
 • Wear stout walking shoes—trails are uneven.  
 • Bring sun protection (hat, sunscreen) and bottled water.  
 • If you want fewer crowds, ask your guide to take you to less-visited pockets of the limestone forest.  

Let me know if you’d like help booking a private tour, transportation from Kunming, or if you need more logistical details!
