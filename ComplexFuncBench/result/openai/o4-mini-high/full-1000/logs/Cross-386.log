After the meeting ends at 9 AM, I will fly from Orlando to Washington for a vacation. Could you help me find the earliest flight to Washington after the meeting and call a taxi to take me to the airport right after the meeting? Don't forget to look up the hotel within 20 kilometers of the airport in Washington and check what fun places there are around the hotel.
