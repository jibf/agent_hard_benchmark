2025-08-14 10:31:34,541 - evaluation_logger_Cross-207 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Ottawa for a five-day business trip on November 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Calgary directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:51,106 - evaluation_logger_Cross-207 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—happy to help! To set up the multi-stop itinerary, I need the name of the nearby city you’d like to visit after Ottawa. For example, many travelers go on to Montréal, Toronto or Québec City. Which city would you like for your three-day fun stop?
