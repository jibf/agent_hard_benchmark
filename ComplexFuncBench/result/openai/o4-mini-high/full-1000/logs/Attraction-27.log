2025-08-14 11:08:43,207 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-27 - INFO - Final Response: Here’s a deeper look at the Taj Mahal, one of the world’s most celebrated monuments:

1. Overview & History  
   • Location: Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, on the south bank of the Yamuna River  
   • Patron: Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, built in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal  
   • Construction: Began in 1632 and completed around 1653, employing thousands of artisans  
   • UNESCO World Heritage Site: Inscribed in 1983 for “the jewel of Muslim art in India”  

2. Architectural Highlights  
   • Material: Pure white Makrana marble inlaid with semi-precious stones (pietra dura)  
   • Main dome: Rises to about 73 m (240 ft) with four smaller domed kiosks (chattris) at the corners  
   • Symmetry: Perfectly mirrored on an east–west axis; reflecting pools accentuate this balance  
   • Supporting structures:  
     – Red-sandstone gateway (Darwaza) to the south  
     – Mosque on the west side and a jawab (guesthouse) on the east  
     – Formal Charbagh (four-quartered) gardens with water channels  

3. Visiting Information  
   • Hours: Open daily from sunrise to sunset (closed Fridays for prayers)  
   • Best times: Early morning and late afternoon for cooler temperatures and softer light  
   • Entry fees (subject to change):  
     – Foreign visitors ≈ ₹1,100 (includes access to main mausoleum)  
     – Indian visitors ≈ ₹50  
   • Facilities: Shoe-cover counters, clean restrooms, drinking-water points, souvenir stalls  
   • Tips:  
     – Dress modestly and carry minimal metal objects (security checks are strict)  
     – Hire an audio guide or private guide for historical context  
     – Beware of touts; book tickets online or at the official counter

   • By train: Frequent services from New Delhi (approx. 2–3 hrs) to Agra Cantt or Agra Fort station  
   • By car/coach: 210 km via the Yamuna Expressway (2–4 hrs, depending on traffic)  
   • Local transport: Auto-rickshaws, cycle-rickshaws or hotel-booked cabs for last-mile transfers
