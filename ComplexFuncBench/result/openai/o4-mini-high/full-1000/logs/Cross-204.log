2025-08-14 10:31:15,740 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to San Francisco for a four-day business trip on November 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for five days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Seattle directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:34,534 - evaluation_logger_Cross-204 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—happy to help you find the perfect multi-stop itinerary. To get started, could you please let me know:

1. Which nearby city you’d like to visit after your four‐day stay in San Francisco.  
2. Confirmation of your travel dates for legs two and three. I’ve penciled in:  
   • SF → Your vacation city on 2024-11-19 (after four days in SF)  
   • Vacation city → Seattle on 2024-11-24 (after five days of fun)  
3. How many travelers and your preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business or First)?

Once I have those details, I’ll pull the multi-stop flight options for you.
