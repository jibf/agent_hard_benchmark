2025-08-14 10:31:27,011 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Milan for a four-day business trip on December 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Prague directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:50,713 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—here’s what I have so far for your multi‐stop itinerary:

  • Leg 1: Prague → Milan on December 15, 2024  
  • Leg 2: Milan → [your chosen nearby city] after four days of work  
  • Leg 3: [that city] → Prague at the end of your two-day fun trip  

To proceed I just need a couple details:

  1. Which nearby city would you like to visit after Milan?  
     (For example Venice, Verona, Turin, etc.)  
  2. Do these dates look good?
     - Depart Milan on December 19, 2024  
     - Return from your fun-city to Prague on December 21, 2024  

Once you confirm the city and dates, I’ll pull flight options for you.
