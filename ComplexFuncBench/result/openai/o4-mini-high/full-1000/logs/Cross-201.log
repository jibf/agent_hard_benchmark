2025-08-14 10:30:59,736 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Madrid for a seven-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Rome directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:11,620 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—can you please tell me which nearby city you’d like to visit after Madrid for your four-day break? Once I have that, I can look up the multi-stop flights (Rome → Madrid on Dec 5, then Madrid → your chosen city, then back to Rome).
