2025-08-14 10:31:03,356 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Los Angeles for a five-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Vancouver directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 10:31:14,585 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—I can help with that. To set up the multi-stop itinerary, I just need the name of the “nearby city” you plan to visit after Los Angeles. For example, San Diego, Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, etc. Which destination would you like for your two-day fun trip?
