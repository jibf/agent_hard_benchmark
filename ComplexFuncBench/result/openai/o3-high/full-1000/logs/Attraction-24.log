2025-08-14 11:56:05,562 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-24 - INFO - Final Response: Amsterdam Dungeon – What to Know Before You Go

1. What it is  
   • A 60- to 75-minute, actor-led “scare-tainment” experience that takes you through 500 years of dark Dutch history—think plague doctors, witch trials, VOC sailors, Spanish inquisitors and more.  
   • Expect a series of theatrical sets, special-effects lighting, smells, sounds, sudden surprises and plenty of gallows humour rather than a classic museum or haunted-house walkthrough.

2. Show & set highlights (may vary slightly)  
   • The Descent – a rickety medieval “elevator” that plunges you into the depths.  
   • Council of Blood – face a vindictive judge during the Spanish occupation.  
   • Torture Chamber – grisly instruments up close (audience members often “volunteer”).  
   • Plague Street – meet Amsterdam’s plague doctor and his leeches.  
   • VOC Ship & the Flying Dutchman – storms, cannon fire and mutiny at sea.  
   • Rembrandt’s Secrets – eerie tales about the master painter.  
   • Witch Burning & Gallows Field – feel the heat of a witch trial.  
   • Mirror/Labyrinth of Lost Souls – strobe-lit maze designed to disorient.  
   • (Seasonal pop-ups) – Halloween specials, Krampus nights, etc.

3. Languages & group formats  
   • Shows run in Dutch and in English. Your preferred language is chosen at the entrance—mixed-language groups are kept separate.  
   • Groups are capped at ± 30 people per tour; departures every 10–15 minutes during peak periods.

4. Tickets & pricing  
   • Standard timed-entry ticket from the API: US$ 26.26 (≈ €24–25). Price flexes by date & demand.  
   • Free cancellation available up to 24 h before your slot.  
   • Children 0–2 enter free; minors under 18 must be accompanied by an adult (18+).  
   • What’s included: admission to all live shows and sets; no hidden fees inside.

5. Practical info  
   • Opening hours (typical): Mon–Fri 11:00–18:00, Sat–Sun 10:00–19:00. Last tour starts ~1 h before closing. Always double-check the calendar when booking.  
   • Location: Rokin 78, 1001 KW Amsterdam – 2 min walk south of Dam Square. Trams 4/14/24 stop “Rokin”, metro lines 52 (Noord/Zuidlijn) stop “Rokin”. No onsite parking; nearest garage is Q-Park Bijenkorf or Waterlooplein.  
   • Duration: plan on 1¼ h inside plus a short queue for ticket scan/security.  
   • Accessibility: one wheelchair per tour (book in advance). Two small staircases mean the full circuit is not 100 % accessible, but staff can offer work-arounds for most scenes.  
   • Bags & photography: large backpacks and suitcases prohibited; small day-packs OK. Filming, flash or live streaming inside the sets is not allowed.  
   • Comfort & scare level: recommended minimum age is 10, but it depends on the child’s tolerance for loud noises, darkness and jump scares. There is no extreme gore, but plenty of tension-building effects.
