2025-08-14 11:07:56,817 - evaluation_logger_Cross-205 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Chicago for a two-day business trip on December 1, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to New York directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?

I’ve got the first and last legs of your trip covered:

• New York → Chicago on Dec 1 2024  
• [Nearby City] → New York on Dec 6 2024 (after three vacation days)

To complete the search I just need to know which “nearby” city you’d like to spend those three fun days in. Popular options within a short hop of Chicago include:

1. Milwaukee, WI (craft-beer scene & lakefront culture)  
2. St. Louis, MO (Gateway Arch, live blues, BBQ)  
3. Indianapolis, IN (sports museums, walkable canal district)  
4. Detroit, MI (Motown, revitalized riverfront)  
5. Minneapolis, MN (art scene, winter activities)

Let me know which one (or any other city) you prefer, and I’ll pull up multi-stop flight options that fit the exact dates and cabin class you want.
