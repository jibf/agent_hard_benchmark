2025-08-14 11:07:51,226 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Los Angeles for a five-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Vancouver directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 11:08:03,314 - evaluation_logger_Cross-202 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—just to make sure I search for the right flights, could you tell me:

1. Which “nearby city” you’d like to visit after Los Angeles (e.g., San Diego, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Palm Springs, etc.)?  
2. Your preferred travel dates for that leg (for example, depart L.A. on Dec 10 and return to Vancouver on Dec 12 or 13)?  

Once I have those details I can pull up the multi-stop options that match.
