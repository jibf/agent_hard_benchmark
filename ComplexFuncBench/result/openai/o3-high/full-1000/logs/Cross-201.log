2025-08-14 11:07:26,813 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Madrid for a seven-day business trip on December 5, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Rome directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 11:07:47,262 - evaluation_logger_Cross-201 - INFO - Final Response: Happy to help! To find the best multi-stop itinerary I just need a bit more detail:

1. Which “nearby city” would you like to visit after Madrid?  
   • Popular choices include Valencia (beach/coastal vibe), Seville (historic Andalusian ambience) or Barcelona (lively arts & food scene) – but let me know any Spanish (or even Portuguese) city you have in mind.  

2. How many people are traveling, and are any children under 18 coming along?  

3. Preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First)?  

Once I have those three pieces of information I can pull up the exact multi-city flight options for you.
