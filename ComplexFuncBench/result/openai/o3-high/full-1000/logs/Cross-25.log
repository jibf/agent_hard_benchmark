2025-08-14 10:26:29,350 - evaluation_logger_Cross-25 - INFO - Query: My family and I are planning to go to Berlin, Germany, from November 25th to 30th, 2024, and visit the world-famous Brandenburg Gate. To make our journey more comfortable and convenient, we hope to find a hotel that's nearest to the Brandenburg Gate. Besides that, arrange a taxi for us at 1 p.m. on the 25th to take us from Berlin Hauptbahnhof to the Brandenburg Gate.
2025-08-14 10:26:50,702 - evaluation_logger_Cross-25 - INFO - Final Response: I can certainly start gathering options, but I still need a couple of details from you so I can give the best-suited hotel and taxi quotes:

1. Hotel stay  
• How many adults will be staying?  
• Any children under 18? (If yes, their ages are important because some hotels price differently.)  
• Do you need more than one room?

2. Taxi  
• Is a standard sedan OK, or do you prefer a larger vehicle (e.g., van) if you have a lot of luggage or several passengers?

Once I have those details I’ll check the closest available hotels to the Brandenburg Gate for 25–30 Nov 2024 and book the taxi for 13:00 on the 25th from Berlin Hauptbahnhof to the Brandenburg Gate.
