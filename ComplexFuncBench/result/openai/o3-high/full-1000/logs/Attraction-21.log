2025-08-14 11:55:44,683 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-21 - INFO - Final Response: Arc de Triomphe – Quick Facts  
• Location: Place Charles-de-Gaulle (formerly Place de l’Étoile), western end of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, Paris, France  
• Coordinates / Height: 50 m tall × 45 m wide × 22 m deep  
• Architect: Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin; completed by Jean-Arnaud Raymond & Guillaume-Abel Blouet after Chalgrin’s death  
• Construction: 1806 – 1836 (interrupted after Napoleon’s fall, resumed under King Louis-Philippe)  
• Style: Neoclassical, inspired by the ancient Roman Arch of Titus  
• Purpose: Monument to the armies of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Empire; later adopted as a national memorial to all French war dead  
• Annual visitors: ≈1.5 million climb to the terrace; tens of millions view it from ground level every year

1. Historical Background  
– 1806: Napoleon I orders a “triumphal arch” after the victory at Austerlitz.  
– 1811: Chalgrin dies; only the foundations and lower piers are up. Work stops in 1814 when the coalition invades Paris.  
– 1823: briefly rededicated as a royal monument by King Louis XVIII; plans change again with the 1830 July Revolution.  
– 1832-1836: Louis-Philippe resumes construction as a unifying symbol to honor “the Armies of the Revolution and Empire.” Official inauguration: 29 July 1836 (6th anniversary of the July Revolution).  
– 1921: Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from WWI installed beneath the vault; Eternal Flame lit 11 Nov 1923, rekindled every evening at 18:30.

2. Architecture & Sculpture  
A single great vaulted arch flanked by two smaller transverse vaults. Major sculptural groups:  
• “Le Départ des Volontaires de 1792” (a.k.a. La Marseillaise) by François Rude – east façade, right pier.  
• “Le Triomphe de 1810” by Jean-Pierre Cortot – east façade, left pier.  
• “La Résistance de 1814” by Antoine Étex – west façade, right pier.  
• “La Paix de 1815” by Antoine Étex – west façade, left pier.  
Friezes and bas-reliefs around the base show key battles (Austerlitz, Jena, Aboukir, etc.).  
Inner vaults list 660 generals; those killed in action are underlined.

3. Viewing Platform  
Take 284 steps (or a lift + 46 steps) to a small museum mid-level and then the terrace for panoramic views: Champs-Élysées to the east, La Défense to the west, Eiffel Tower to the south-east, Sacré-Cœur to the north-east. Twelve avenues radiate like a star (étoile), making dramatic photo lines but also notorious traffic.

4. Visiting Practicalities (2023-24)  
Opening hours: roughly 10:00 – 23:00 (Apr-Sept) / 10:00 – 22:30 (Oct-Mar). Last admission ≈45 min before close.  
Tickets: ~€13 adults; free for EU residents <26 yrs and many others (check official site). Best skip-the-line option: buy e-ticket or Paris Museum Pass.  
Access: DON’T cross the roundabout; use pedestrian tunnels at the north & south ends of Champs-Élysées.  
Closures: morning of every 11 Nov, 8 May, 14 Jul; occasional state ceremonies when the eternal flame is rekindled.  
Night lighting: façade lit nightly; the Eternal Flame is always visible.

5. Symbolic Role & Events  
• Bastille Day (14 July) military parade starts here.  
• Tour de France final stage circles the arch before sprinting down Champs-Élysées.  
• New Year’s Eve: large-scale video projections on the monument.  
• Site of national mourning: Charles de Gaulle’s funeral cortege (1970), victims of terrorist attacks, etc.

6. Fun Facts  
– The arch was the world’s largest until 1982, when North Korea completed the Arch of Triumph (modelled on Paris’s but 10 m taller).  
– Shortly after Napoleon’s death, his remains (1840) and later Victor Hugo’s (1885) lay in state beneath it.  
– A 1919 biplane (Charles Godefroy) famously flew through the main vault to honor WWI aviators.  
– You can spot bullet scars from 1944 street fighting during Paris’s Liberation.

7. Nearby Highlights  
• Champs-Élysées shopping & Grand Palais (10-min walk).  
• Parc Monceau (15-min walk northeast).  
• Trocadéro & Eiffel Tower (20-25 min walk / 10 min by metro).

Whether you’re a history buff, architecture fan, or just chasing skyline views, climbing the Arc de Triomphe is one of Paris’s most rewarding quick visits.
