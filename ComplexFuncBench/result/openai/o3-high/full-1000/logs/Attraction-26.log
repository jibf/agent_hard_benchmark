2025-08-14 11:56:21,752 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-26 - INFO - Final Response: Forbidden City – Quick Facts  
• Official name: The Palace Museum (故宫博物院)  
• Location: Just north of Tian’anmen Square, central Beijing, China  
• Size: 720,000 m² with 980 surviving buildings (about 8,700 rooms)  
• Construction: 1406-1420 (early Ming); imperial residence until the abdication of the last Qing emperor in 1912  
• UNESCO World Heritage Site: Since 1987 (“the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world”)  

1. What makes it special  
• Political and ceremonial heart of China for 500 years, home to 24 emperors (14 Ming + 10 Qing).  
• Strictly off limits to ordinary people for centuries – hence the Western nickname “Forbidden City.”  
• Exemplary Ming-Qing palace architecture: axial symmetry, yellow-glazed roof tiles (yellow = imperial), red walls, guardian animal statuettes, carved white-marble platforms.  
• Outstanding museum collection: ~1.8 million artefacts—paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, ceramics, timepieces, jewels, imperial robes and archives.  

2. Layout & must-see spots (walk south → north along the central axis)  
Outer Court (State/ceremonial)  
  • Meridian Gate (Wǔmén) – main entrance, five arches, drums & bells once announced imperial departures.  
  • Hall of Supreme Harmony (Tàihédiàn) – the throne room; world’s largest surviving wooden hall.  
  • Hall of Central Harmony – smaller preparatory hall for the emperor.  
  • Hall of Preserving Harmony – banquet & imperial examination venue.  

Inner Court (Residential/administrative)  
  • Gate of Heavenly Purity → Palace of Heavenly Purity (Emperor’s living/working quarters).  
  • Hall of Union & Peace (symbolic union of Yin/Yang).  
  • Palace of Earthly Tranquillity (Empress’s palace).  
  • Imperial Garden – ancient pines, rockeries, mosaicked pathways; look for the Pavilion of 10 000 Springs.  

Special galleries (extra tickets, limited numbers)  
  • Treasure Gallery (jewellery, jadeite cabbage, imperial seals).  
  • Clock & Watch Gallery – European & Chinese automaton clocks (Hall of Ancestral Worship).  

3. Practical visitor information (latest policies)  
Opening days: Tuesday–Sunday; CLOSED Mondays (except some national holidays).  
Hours:  
  • Apr-Oct 08:30–17:00 (last entry 16:00)  
  • Nov-Mar  08:30–16:30 (last entry 15:30)  
Daily cap: 40 000 visitors; all tickets are now real-name & online only (no same-day cash windows).  
Prices (reference): High-season ¥60 CNY; Low-season ¥40 CNY; Treasure/Clock museums ¥10 each.  
ID needed: Foreigners must enter with the same passport used to book. Children under 6 or <1.2 m go free (still need a ticket).  

4. How to get there  
• Beijing Subway Line 1 – Tian’anmen East (Exit A) or Tian’anmen West (Exit B); 5-min walk north.  
• Line 2 – Qianmen (longer walk).  
• Main route is south→north, exiting at Gate of Divine Prowess (Shénwǔmén) – perfect to pop across the road to Jingshan Park for that famous rooftop panorama.  

5. Suggested time & route  
• Express visit: 2 hrs – stick to the central axis plus Imperial Garden.  
• Standard visit: 3-4 hrs – add side courtyards, Treasure & Clock galleries.  
• Deep dive: Full day – explore western/eastern six palaces, special exhibitions.  

6. Insider tips  
• Arrive early (before 09:00) to beat tour-group crowds at Taihe Gate.  
• Download the Palace Museum’s official English app or rent the multi-language audio guide at Meridian Gate (deposit required).  
• Travel light – large bags must be left at storage near the entrance.  
• Wear comfortable shoes; surfaces are stone and distances add up.  
• Combine with: Jingshan Park (sunset), Beihai Park, National Museum of China, hutong alleyways around Nanluoguxiang.  
• Winter can be magical (bare trees, low crowds) but dress warmly; most halls are unheated.  
• Forbidden City closes sharply at final exit time—allow a cushion to walk to the north gate.  

7. Accessibility & health notes (per current ticket supplier info)  
• Wheelchair access is limited ; many high stone thresholds and staircases.  
• Not recommended for travellers with mobility, spinal or cardiovascular issues.  
• Public transit is close; taxis can drop at East Chang’an Avenue security checkpoint.  

8. Booking a ticket  
• Pre-booking online is mandatory. Many visitors use the Palace Museum’s official site (Chinese) or international platforms (e.g., “Forbidden City Ticket” product operated by Authentic China Tours, free cancellation, ~US $10).  
• You choose an entry time slot (AM or PM); show passport at Meridian Gate “online ticket” channel—no paper needed.  

9. Fun trivia  
• The complex supposedly contains 9,999.5 rooms (legend demanded <10,000, the celestial perfect number).  
• Colour coding: Yellow roofs (imperial), black library roof (to “quench fire”), green garden pavilions (vitality).  
• Movie buffs: Featured in “The Last Emperor” – the first Western film authorized to shoot inside the palace (1986).
