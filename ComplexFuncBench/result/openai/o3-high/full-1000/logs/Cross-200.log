2025-08-14 11:07:20,963 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to London for a three-day business trip on November 18, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Berlin directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 11:07:36,473 - evaluation_logger_Cross-200 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—let’s pin down a few details so I can pull the exact flights you want:

1. Which “nearby city” would you like to visit after London? (Popular options are Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, etc., but it’s totally up to you.)  
2. Do the travel dates below look right?  
   • Berlin  ➜  London — Mon 18 Nov 2024  
   • London ➜ [your chosen city] — Thu 21 Nov 2024 (after three full business days in London)  
   • [chosen city] ➜ Berlin — Sat 23 Nov 2024 (after two days of leisure)  
   If you’d prefer different days or times, let me know.  
3. How many people are traveling, and what cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First) do you want?

With those details, I can search the multi-stop itinerary and show you the best options.
