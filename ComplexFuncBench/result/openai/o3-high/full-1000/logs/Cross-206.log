2025-08-14 11:07:58,527 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Milan for a four-day business trip on December 15, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for two days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Prague directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?

2025-08-14 11:08:45,485 - evaluation_logger_Cross-206 - INFO - Final Response: Got it – here’s the basic layout of the flights you’ll need:

  • Leg 1 Prague (PRG) → Milan (LIN or MXP) on Sun 15 Dec 2024  
  • Leg 2 [Nearby-city airport] → Prague (PRG) on Sat 21 Dec 2024 (after your two-day getaway)

To run a multi-city flight search I need to know which “nearby city” you’d like to spend those two vacation days in (and its airport). Popular, easy hops from Milan by train are:

  • Venice (VCE) – ~2 h 30 m by train  
  • Florence (FLR) – ~1 h 50 m by train  
  • Verona (VRN) – ~1 h 20 m by train  
  • Bologna (BLQ) – ~1 h 15 m by train  
  • Turin (TRN) – ~1 h by train  

Let me know which city (or another one you have in mind), and if you have any cabin-class or price-vs-speed preferences, and I’ll pull up the best multi-stop flight options.
