2025-08-14 11:58:22,526 - evaluation_logger_Attraction-67 - INFO - Final Response: Good news—there is a very popular Titanic-themed experience in Belfast that comes in well under your £50 (≈US $50) target:

1. Titanic Belfast – Standard Admission Ticket  
   • Current online price: US $32.43 (≈£26) per adult  
   • Location: Titanic Quarter, 1 Olympic Way, Belfast BT3 9EP  
   • What you get:  
     – Self-guided entry to the nine interactive galleries covering the shipyard, launch, maiden voyage and sinking  
     – Access to the thrilling “Shipyard Ride” dark-ride experience  
     – Admission to the SS Nomadic (the last White Star Line vessel) moored just outside  
   • Opening hours: Generally 09:00–18:00 (last entry 1 hr 45 min before closing; varies slightly by season—check on the day)  
   • Good to know:  
     – Timed-entry: exchange your voucher at the ground-floor desk for the next available slot  
     – Wheelchair and stroller friendly; service animals welcome  
     – Allow 2–2½ hours inside, plus 30 min on SS Nomadic  
     – Audio guides cost extra (a few pounds) if you’d like narration tailored for children  
   • How to book: Use the “Titanic Belfast Admission Ticket” product (slug: prdimc5gcwtt-titanic-belfast-admission-ticket) on Booking.com, Viator, GetYourGuide or the attraction’s own website.

Other Titanic-related options (all in/around Belfast)

• Titanic Belfast & Giant’s Causeway Day Tour — US $95 (≈£75): full-day coach excursion from Dublin; great but above your budget.  
• Titanic Belfast & Giant’s Causeway Day Tour (departing Belfast) — typically £55–£65; also over your limit.  
• Belfast City History & Titanic Birthplace Private Tour — private driver-guide service; £140+ depending on group size.  
• Titanic Distillers at Thompson Dock (whisky tour set in the historic dry dock) — ±£35 including tasting; limited availability.  
• Titanic Walking Trail (self-guided via app) — free to download; optional in-app extras ~£5–£10.

For a first-time family visit, the standalone Titanic Belfast ticket above is the best value and the one your child will likely enjoy most. If you have more time (and budget) you can always add one of the other activities later.

Tip for families  
• Arrive before 11:30 am or after 3 pm in peak periods to avoid queues.  
• Bring a light jacket: several exhibits and the Nomadic deck are partially outdoors.  
• Check the SS Nomadic isn’t closed for a private event on your chosen day (rare, but it happens).

Enjoy exploring the birthplace of the world’s most famous ship!
