2025-08-14 11:08:02,778 - evaluation_logger_Cross-207 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Ottawa for a five-day business trip on November 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for three days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Calgary directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?

To build the right three-leg, multi-city itinerary I’ll need to know which “nearby city” you’d like to visit after Ottawa. Popular choices within easy reach include Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto, and Kingston, but feel free to name any place you have in mind.

Could you let me know which city you’d prefer for your three-day vacation (Nov 25 – 28)?
