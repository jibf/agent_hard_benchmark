2025-08-14 12:10:49,608 - evaluation_logger_Flights-66 - INFO - Query: Our company is planning to organize a three-day trip from Tianjin to Seoul. Right now, we have a rough plan: it could be either from November 20th to 23rd, 2024 or from December 8th to 11th, 2024. I need to find out the best air tickets and detailed information about the flights during these two time periods.
2025-08-14 12:11:05,724 - evaluation_logger_Flights-66 - INFO - Final Response: Sure—before I can look up the actual flight options and detailed fares, could you let me know a few more details?

1. How many travelers will there be (adults, children, infants)?
2. Which cabin class would you like me to search (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First)?
3. Do you have a preference for:
   • Non-stop only, or are 1-stop itineraries acceptable?  
   • “Best” balance of price & duration, the absolute lowest price, or the fastest overall trip?

Once I have those details, I can pull up the best round-trip options for both:
• Wed 20 Nov → Sat 23 Nov 2024, and  
• Sun 08 Dec → Wed 11 Dec 2024.
