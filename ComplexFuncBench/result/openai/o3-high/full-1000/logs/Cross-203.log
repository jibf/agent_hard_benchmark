2025-08-14 11:07:55,099 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Orlando for a three-day business trip on October 20, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Toronto directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 11:08:10,771 - evaluation_logger_Cross-203 - INFO - Final Response: Sure! To set up a 3-leg (multi-stop) itinerary I’ll need to know which “nearby city” you’d like to visit after your business meetings in Orlando.  

Popular Florida options that are easy to reach from Orlando and have good nonstop service back to Toronto include:  
• Miami (MIA)  
• Fort Lauderdale (FLL)  
• Tampa (TPA)  
• Jacksonville (JAX)  
• Key West (EYW)  

Just let me know which city (or another of your choice), plus how many travelers and your preferred cabin class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First). Then I can pull up the exact flights that fit:

1. Toronto → Orlando, Oct 20 2024  
2. Orlando → [Your Fun City], Oct 23 2024  
3. [Your Fun City] → Toronto, Oct 27 2024  

Let me know and I’ll search the best options right away!
