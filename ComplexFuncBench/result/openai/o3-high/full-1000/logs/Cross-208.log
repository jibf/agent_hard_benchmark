2025-08-14 11:08:11,208 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Query: I'm flying to Miami for a two-day business trip on December 10, 2024. After my work is done, I'll travel to a nearby city for four days of fun. When the vacation is over, I'll fly back to Boston directly from there. Could you look up multi-stop flights that fit my needs?
2025-08-14 11:08:29,820 - evaluation_logger_Cross-208 - INFO - Final Response: I can definitely set up a three-leg (multi-city) search for you, but first I need to know which “nearby city” you’d like to spend those four vacation days in.   
Popular options reachable from Miami by a short hop include:

• Orlando (theme-parks, nightlife)  
• Tampa / St. Pete (beaches, craft-beer scene)  
• Key West (island vibes, watersports)  
• Fort Lauderdale (beaches, art & food)  
• Nassau, Bahamas (quick international getaway)

Let me know which city (or another one) you prefer, and I’ll pull up the flight options with these legs:

1) Boston → Miami (10 Dec 2024)  
2) Miami → [Your Chosen City] (12 Dec 2024)  
3) [Your Chosen City] → Boston (16 Dec 2024)

Feel free to add cabin-class or traveler details (number of adults, kids, etc.) if you have any preferences!
